Notes, Questions, 
and Clarifications

[Notes]
I want to remind you to take notes during our sessions and to write down any questions that you want to remember to think about later. If you have any questions during our sessions that it would be helpful for me to address during our time together, please do not hesitate to ask. As well, during any part of our sessions, if I am sharing something and the ways I am saying something doesn’t make sense or you would just like for me to explain the concept in a different way, just raise you hand and waive it. I will gladly pause and make sure that we are all understanding. As I have mentioned, our chief goal here is your understanding, so it is more than worth out time to make sure things make sense.

Mission
EQUIP Nashville
To equip Ethos Church with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction (SSA)

[Notes]
First, let’s remind ourselves of the goal of this initiative at Ethos: to equip Ethos Church with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction. This is what we are aiming for.

[Notes]
During Session One, we discussed the need and challenge at Ethos and in our city, we united behind a solution and strategy, we clarified expectations, and we had conversations about terms and beliefs. From all this we built consensus around this initiative at Ethos. Today, we get to some of the meat of the content.
Session Goal & Objectives
EQUIP Nashville
Goal: 		establish foundation for 					            you to minister

Objectives
Personal story
Development of same-sex attraction
Morality of homosexuality

[Notes]
Today, our goal is to establish a foundation for you to minister to those who experience same-sex attraction. How are we going to do this? First, I am going to share my story of experiencing same-sex attraction as a reference point for the rest of your learning. Next, we will discuss 8 common factors in the development of same-sex attraction. And third, we will talk about how to approach the conversation about the morality of homosexuality. My hope is that each of these gives you a glimpse of the struggles and mindset of people who experiences same-sex attraction, and that this new familiarity leads to confidence that you can know and serve those who experience same-sex attraction. Then, next Session, we will build on this foundation by providing you with practical advice and tools for ministering to those who experiences same-sex attraction.

Is this worth it?

[Notes]
Now, by this point, one session in and two sessions to go, you may be wondering “Is this worth it?” Realistically, you only have so much time in your schedules, and you can’t do everything. I sometime ask myself the same question. This is what I have dedicated my life to do and risked reputation and finances to make a reality. If you would, let me share with you an excerpt from one of my reflections from September after going on a retreat for men who experience same-sex attraction. I go back to this often as a reminder of why what we are doing here is necessary—what’s at stake. You’ll find the printed excerpt in your packet. Please take a few minutes to read it, and then we can discuss it together.

I argue that the better question is “What are we already losing?” When you think about the people you know who experience same-sex attraction, do you think this is true? Imagine all of their talent and courage and intelligence working toward the Kingdom. What do you think?
EQUIP Nashville
Personal Story

[Notes]
The best way to start is for you to hear the story of a person who experiences same-sex attraction. It is a story of pain and redemption. It is a story that is not over. It is also a story with elements that are very common among those who experience same-sex attraction. Soak this in—my hope is that my story can serve as scaffolding for our learning here—as a reference point for the principles we discuss later.

BREAK

[Notes]
Okay, let’s take a short break and then we will discuss 8 common factors in the development of same-sex attraction
EQUIP Nashville
Development of SSA

[Notes]
How does a person come to develop same-sex attraction? I believe this is a great next step from hearing someone’s story, because just understanding the complexity and diversity of how a person can develop same-sex attraction will shift the paradigm through which you see these persons. But, let me say from the get-go that I am not sharing with you how a person develops same-sex attraction so that you can go dissect those you know that experience same-sex attraction. The goal is for you to understand these individuals better so that you can have the confidence that you can love and serve these individuals.

I am going to use a concept of understanding from a therapist named David Matheson out in Utah. David Matheson is a prominent clinician and theologian on the topic of same-sex attraction. His work around gender wholeness is widely considered to be one of the standard-bearers of modern thought around same-sex attraction in Christian orthodoxy. This concept comes from three decades of clinical practice, more than 100 detailed client profiles, and a wealth of personal experience, theological study, and scientific knowledge.

Correlated but not necessarily causal

At least 5 of 8 factors involved in 90% of cases

[Notes]
The important thing to remember is that these 8 factors have been strongly correlated with same-sex attraction. While the author’s personal experience and client data leads him to conclude that these factors can be causal, demonstrating any kind of causation in psychological research is nearly impossible. Also, all eight factors are not present in every case, so don’t assume that someone you know who experiences same-sex attraction experiences all of these factors. From the author’s thirty years of practice and hundreds of client notes, he has determined that 90% of the time individuals experiencing same-sex attraction present at least 5 of these factors. Okay, so I’m only claiming correlation and that at least 5 out of the 8 factors are present in each case. Also know that this is a process and that no one’s process looks the same. In one case, the first factor may be a cause and the second factor may be an effect that in itself because a cause for the third factor. In another case, this order can be completely flipped around.

[Notes]
I’ve split the factors into two sets of 4. The set on the right are the four factors that tend to be primary causes in the development of same-sex attraction, where as the set on the left often serve as secondary causes that contribute to primary causes.

The eight factors are (1) biological and physical issues, (2) unhealthy opposite sex relationships, (3) gender distortion, (4) same-sex disaffiliation, (5) gender incongruity, (6) learning, (7) sexual abuse, and (8) psychological issues. 

As I go through this, I am going to make connections between each of the factors and parts of my story that you just heard to help you organize these ideas, but while I will speak about the experience of a man who experiences same-sex attraction, all of these apply to women who experience same-sex attraction as well.

Emotional impact of unhealthy relationships with individuals of the opposite sex
Relational experience with
Individual’s reaction to
Unhealthy Opposite-sex Relationships

[Notes]
Factor One: Unhealthy Opposite-sex Relationships. This factor has to do with the emotional impact of unhealthy relationships with individuals of the opposite sex during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The relational experience of same-sex attracted persons with opposite sex individuals can be over-connected, feeling aligned with mom, a confidant, needed and used as a surrogate husband. Or maybe the child feels smothered, controlled, or overprotected. Perhaps instead abandoned, neglected, abused, or traumatized. Maybe criticized or shamed. Or even over-praised. Men describe being feminized by their mother of being made to feel shame about their gender. Sometimes, this can even be sexualized—not necessarily sex but a mother who is too open with her sexuality from the stories she tells, comments about the boys sexual parts, or being overtly naked. One of those describes the child’s experience with the opposite sex. Its also helpful to note here—and this applied to all of the factors—what matters is what the child perceives, not what actually happened. I have heard plenty of stories of children with great parents who just misinterpreted their parents’ actions when they were children. Okay, so back to the second factor. Then, the child reacts against or relates to his experience with mother previously discussed in one of the following ways: oppositional, described by rejection, hatred, and disgust; avoidant, described by fear and staying away; indifference, described by retreating into one’s false self; enmeshed, described by neediness and being bound by guilt; and comfortable, described by overfamiliar and safe.

I would describe my relationship with my mother as over-connected, confidant, surrogate husband, smothered, over-praised. I reacted by being enmeshed and bound by guilt to my mother, but eventually I transitioned into being oppositional, rejecting my mother and resenting how I had been treated. 

Think about your own relationship with your opposite-sex parent or maybe that of a close family member or friend—would you describe that relationship in these ways?

Improper distinction between genders
Inaccurate concept of opposite gender
Inaccurate concept of own gender
Gender Distortion

[Notes]
Factor Two: Gender Distortion. First, what is gender? The gender with which we identify is associated with certain traits, roles, and expectations. Distortion of gender involves a lack of proper distinction between the genders. This factor has to do with how people see individuals of the opposite sex and how they view themselves in relation to the opposite sex. It is important to note that while all men are susceptible to distortions in their views of women, distortions in these areas have been observed to be common among those who experience same-sex attraction, which block them from experiencing genderedness and complementarity. Men here tend to view women inaccurately and, as they relate to women, they tend to view themselves inaccurately too. First, their concept of the opposite gender will be inaccurate. Gender concept is formed from a combination of sources, including role modeling by parents and siblings, the examples of others in our environment, and social norms as taught to us through the media and significant institutions like religion. Second, their concept of their own gender is inaccurate. So, the male world is then exotic to this male child. Or maybe the male child experiences women as dangerous and lack the sense of complementarity between men and women. There is nothing good about women—they have nothing to offer me. What do I have to offer them? A healthy relationship with gender is to identify with your own gender and see yourself as one of that gender and then to see the opposite gender as exotic, different, complimentary, and having things you want in exchange for thing you can give. Gender distortion is any distortion of that healthy nature.

For me, I definitely had an inaccurate concept of the opposite gender, and I still struggle with this. I saw women as weak, needy, guilt-inducers, manipulators, unintelligent, and useless to me. As far as my own gender, I always generally identified as being masculine, but I could certainly point out ways that I thought I was less masculine than others.

Knowing how I viewed the opposite gender and my own gender, do you think I saw them as complimentary? How do you think this could have affected my attraction to women?

[Notes]
The other two factors in the set on the right have to do with our relationships with individuals of the same sex and how we view individuals of the same gender.
Development of SSA
EQUIP Nashville
Emotional impact of unhealthy relationships with individuals of the same sex
Relational experience with
Individual’s reaction to
Same-sex Disaffiliation

[Notes]
Factor Three: Same-sex Disaffiliation—not identifying with others of the same sex. This factor has to do with the emotional impact of their relationships with individuals of the same sex during childhood and adolescence. This starts with a lack of connection with a boy’s father or brother or male friends and subsequently other males. The boy can feel hurt, neglected, abandoned, mismatched, alienated, isolated, abused, or rejected by his father. Just as with opposite-sex relationships, the boy can react or relate to father in four ways: oppositional, detached, inauthentic, or needy and dependent. All in all, healthy connection fails to happen. The boy does not feel like he is accepted by and one of the same gender as his father. He does not receive needed love and affirmation and intimacy from his father. He feels other than his father and the gender of his father.

As I said, my dad worked a lot and he didn’t know how to be a dad, so we weren’t very close. He didn’t spend a lot of time with me, and the things that stick out to me the most were feelings that if only I were good at tennis or basketball (the sports he liked) he would have loved me more. I felt alone and not good enough, and I responded with great need but also a certain amount of detachment from my dad to protect myself from it hurting too much. 

Think of your own relationship with your same-sex parent or the relationship of a close friend or family member—would you describe that relationship in these ways?

Concept of own gender different than concept of gender of which part of
Inaccurate concept of same gender
Inaccurate concept of own gender
Gender Incongruity

[Notes]
Factor Four: Gender Incongruity. Gender incongruity exists when an individual’s concept of his or her own gender is different than the person’s concept of the gender of which he or she is a part. The boy, attaching with mother and failing to attach with father in some shape or form, does not see himself as a part of his gender. He believes that he isn’t the kind of man that he thinks a man is supposed to be. He doesn’t fit in or match what he thinks a man should be. So he desire what he lacks—intimacy with a man or affirmation from a man that he is a man. He desires that which is exotic and different—his own gender. He feels insecure and inadequate and seeks the place of comfort—his mother—causing more separation from father and his own gender.

As I mentioned in my story, because I was detached from my father, my friends in middle school and the images in media determined my concept of masculinity as either a hyper masculine lumberjack, football player or a perfect looking male underwear model with abs. For me, masculinity was mainly how someone looked and not really what they did. I supposed confidence and being desired by others went with both of my ideas of masculinity. I did not see myself as having that same masculinity, but I deeply desired to be that or more so, to be affirmed by and be friend with people I believed possessed that. You see, I was supposed to see my father as the arbiter of masculinity who then has the power to tell me that I was a man and had what it took, but I didn’t see my dad in that way and he never did that, so I looked for that in other places. 

How does this fit what you already know about sex, gender, and our relationships with our parents?

[Notes]
Now we will talk about the set of factors on the left. As I mentioned before, these factors often serve as secondary causes that contribute to primary causes, on the right.

Development of SSA
EQUIP Nashville
Genes – predisposed, not determined
Physical bodies
Emotional disposition
Biological & Physical

[Notes]
Factor Five: Biological and Physical Issues. This factor includes our genes, our physical bodies, and our emotional disposition. Let’s start with the most controversial one: our genes. There’s been a lot of discussion in the media about the “gay gene” over the last two decades, but, if you review all of the literature, the ultimate conclusion is that we have not found a “gay gene”. What do I mean by that? In contrast with the fact that we know what mutation in certain genes leads to cancer, the research has been inconclusive in finding a gene or a group of genes that causes homosexuality. Now, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t some kind of genetic predisposition—it just means that we haven’t found it yet and no one can claim we have. For example, let’s look at twins studies that have been done. In twins where one of the twins experienced same-sex attraction, the other twin experienced the same 48% of the time. Now, I did graduate from Vanderbilt with Highest Honors in Chemistry and have been published four times in scientific journals, so I have some authority when it comes to scientific research. We know that twins have the exact same genetic makeup. So if there is a gay gene, then it would be present in the twin that experiences both same-sex attraction and the twins (52% of the time) that don’t. A gene that when present causes something less that half of the time isn’t very causal. My conclusion is that there is probably some kind of genetic predisposition—just like every other thing in our lives. But, it is not determined. This would be a very complicated to study, but I doubt someone who only had this first factor and nothing else would develop same-sex attraction. The second part of this first factor is our physical bodies—our size, our proportionality, our athleticism, our beauty, our intelligence, our secondary sex characteristics. These things impact how we see ourselves, our self-esteem, our insecurities, our popularity, and our ability to possess certain feminine or masculine traits. The third aspect of this first factor is our emotional disposition. This includes our temperament and aptitude. Some guys just love adventure and risk while other guys are more thinking individuals and enjoy more complex ideas found in literature or science.

In my life, there might have been some kind of genetic predisposition. I don’t know of any family members who experience same-sex attraction, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any. In terms of physical issues, I’ve never been terribly athletic and I’ve always had narrower shoulders, so it didn’t seem like I fit the image of masculinity. My emotional disposition as a child was someone who generally liked adventure and risk but I did have need for control and predictability, so I can imagine that limiting to interaction with other guys . I never enjoyed rough-housing. 

Think of someone you know that experiences same-sex attraction. What biological and physical factor might they possess that could have contributed to their development of same-sex attraction?
Development of SSA
EQUIP Nashville
We associate ideas and adopt behaviors based on our experiences, which are reinforced by rewards and punishments
Neurons that fire together wire together
Learning

[Notes]
Factor Six: Learning. I don’t mean learning in the sense that we are taught it in school, but instead the psychological concept of learning. In behavioral psychology, scientists argue that everything we do is learned or conditioned or imprinted by past experiences based on rewards and punishments. So, we learn some aspects of our sexuality. We can learn to associate things that weren’t once linked. There’s an accurate saying in neuropsychology that neurons that fire together wire together and vice versa. Let me give a very specific example: we know that anxiety and fear can lead to erections in men. Let’s say a man with some of the factors previously discussed feels insecure or inadequate among men—particularly their confidence, let’s say. They start to recognize that when they are around confident guys, they feel anxious and afraid, they get an erection, and they wish they were that guy. Now our over-sexualize society tells us that anytime a man gets an erection, its because he wants to have sex with the object of his thoughts. So, the individual believes that he must be getting an erection because he wants to have sex with confident men. Now, this process sounds strange, but among men who experience same-sex attraction, it actually very, very common. Particularly when we are teenagers, we are filled with hormones, our bodies are maturing, and our minds are still very impressionable, it is easy to sexualize things. This, for example, is where pornography can enter and wreck havoc. The individual described earlier can even be watching heterosexual pornography, and while he is aroused by the woman in the video, he also finds the man mysterious and different. Every guy in pornography seems to have a perfect body with no body hair and a 10-inch long penis, so any teenager watching this stuff is going to feel inadequate and could sexualize his anxiety from this.

I gave a pretty specific example of this with my friend in middle school and sexualizing watching pornography together. Unfortunately this happened a lot. As a hyper-sexual teenager, I was often aroused my anger or fear, initially having nothing to do with sexual attraction, but the object of this anger or fear was sexualized. I learned to be attracted to something that I was not previously attracted to, whether this be a person or certain physical features in guys or certain personality features in guys. 

What do you think about this concept of learning? Does it make sense to you? Even from your heterosexual experience, can you see ways that you have learned to be aroused by certain things?
Development of SSA
EQUIP Nashville
Common
From the same or opposite sex
Shame
Sexual Abuse

[Notes]
Factor Seven: Sexual Abuse. Unfortunately, this is very common. This can be abuse from someone of the same sex. For a boy, this seriously disrupts his sense of maleness. Men like women and a man liked me, so what am I? Extreme shame and secrecy comes from this. This can be abuse from someone of the opposite sex. For a boy, this leads to fear, disgust, and resentment of the opposite gender and hunger for male protection. As described in the previous factors, these experiences can also serve to condition the individual to associate their same gender and members of their same gender with sexual arousal. I am going to be honest, when I first wrote this material, I wanted to include a disclaimer that I have not be sexually abused, but then when I thought about why I wanted to do this, I was disappointed in myself. I have bought into the lie just like anyone else that being the victim of sexual abuse is dirty and the victim is less good. I am embarrassed to say that I wanted to make sure you didn’t think I have been sexually abused because that is shameful and I didn’t want you to think that of me. This is all to say that the lies of shame are hard for any of us to dismiss, and I cannot imagine the impact that the shame of a victim of sexual abuse can have on that person’s life. 

How does this fit into what you already know about how sex, gender, and learning impact our attractions?

[Notes]
And finally, Factor Eight: Psychological Issues. There are tons psychological issues that are commonly involved either as causes of same-sex attraction or effects of same-sex attraction. They include shame, anxiety, depression, isolation, obsessive compulsions, addiction, trauma and many others.

I’ve dealt with a lot of shame. I’ve had a moderate amount of anxiety, depression, and isolation over time, but nothing to the level that would have constituted a mental illness. I am probably a sex addict from the frequency with which I once watched pornography and masturbated. 

How do you see these issues contributing to a person’s development of SSA?

Predisposed but not determined
No one chooses SSA
Healing is a process
Gender is important

[Notes]
So what are my top takeaways from this concept of development? First, same-sex attraction is not determined by our genes, but our genes do predispose us. Both nature and nurture are involved in the development. That means that parents can protect their children from this to a certain extent. Second, people who experience same-sex attraction did not choose to be same-sex attracted and do not deserve to be same-sex attracted. It is not a punishment for their actions. It is unfair. Third, most of the damage was done in the past, so healing can be long and complicated. Fourth, gender is important, not in the sense that how we define the genders are important but whether or not we are able to identify with our gender is important.

Take-aways
Pornography is destructive
Everyone has experienced one of these
Sexual attraction is not binary

[Notes]
Fifth, pornography and sexual images in the media are very destructive. Sixth, all of us have probably experienced at least one of these. Just because someone presents some of these factors doesn’t mean the person will experience same-sex attraction. But, these are still helpful to understand the distress of an opposite-sex attracted person with gender and intimacy frustrations. Seven, opposite-sex attraction and same-sex attraction are not binary opposites on different ends of a spectrum. I have seen all different combinations of levels of opposite sex attraction and same-sex attraction. Changing one does not directly change another. There may be deeper issues—of identifying with a person’s gender, for example—that influence both and when attended to, impact both, but it is not as simple as two ends of a sliding scale.

The Heart of Female Same-sex Attraction

[Notes]
I mentioned that this description of the development of same-sex attraction applies to both men and women, but I think it is also helpful to point out some of the difference between the two. They are similar in so many ways, but there are a few distinct qualities of female same-sex attraction. 
 
For women, same-sex attractions, same-sex emotional dependency, and same-sex sexual behavior do not necessarily have to co-exist—more so than for men. A woman participating in same-sex sexual behavior can experience both, one, or neither of same-sex attraction and same-sex emotional dependency.
 
As described by Janelle Hallman in The Heart of Female Same-sex Attraction, the central concept of female same-sex attraction is home. A girl needs to find stability, trust, protection, and safety in her relationships with her mother and father—home. When the girl does not attach properly or find her home, she is left searching for a home, often landing in codependent relationships. Just as with male same-sex attraction, healthy attachment with same-sex parent crucial.

For the rest of our time here today, I think it is important that we wade into the muck that is the conversation about the morality of homosexuality. Regardless of whether we want to have this conversation or not—and believe me, I am the first in line not to have this conversation with someone—we need to be able to have this conversation. Perhaps more helpful for our purposes today is that this conversation provides and opportunity to organize our understanding of same-sex attraction, particularly after hearing my story and learning how same-sex attraction develops.

Again, I am not prescribing a belief here but giving recommendations about how to approach the conversation. I think first, it’s great to admit to the other person that while we can read the Bible and look at society for a good idea of what is sin, we can know little—if anything—with absolute certainty. Is there absolute truth? Yes! Can we know it with absolute certainty in a way that we can prove to others? Rarely. Every conversation about whether or not homosexuality is wrong starts by walking through the passages of Scripture concerning homosexuality, but a thorough conversation doesn’t end there.

The Uniqueness of Christian Marriage

One man and one women before God
Reflection of intimacy in trinity
Centrality of procreation

[Notes]
Another way you can speak about homosexuality being wrong is to speak about how Christian marriage between a man and a woman is uniquely right. God created man and woman to reflect the complementary and beauty of the trinity and created Christian marriage between a man and a woman to reflect intimacy in the trinity. Another defining feature of Christian marriage between a man and a woman is the centrality of procreation. While I would not argue that procreation is the sole purpose of sex, procreation is an important purpose of sex in addition to the purpose of expressing your love through the intimate act of sex. Procreation is important because it highlights the responsibility and commitment involved in Christian marriage.

Homosexuality is Unnatural

No examples in nature
Anal sex unnatural
Physical and mental health risks

[Notes]
You could bring up natural law arguments that homosexual marriage is unnatural. Note: I think this is an important point, but there will be many contexts where this will not be appropriate. There are no examples in nature of other species that have homosexual intercourse within a context of social and familiar relationships identical to that of heterosexual pairing. There are of course examples of homosexual activity in animals to assert dominance and certain species with individuals of ambiguous sex, but an analog to the monogamous homosexual couple that adopts children does not exist anywhere else in the animal kingdom. In addition, there is nothing natural about anal sex, whether the recipient is male or female. Physiologically, the anus is only made to excrete—it is not made for things to be inserted. Anal sex commonly leads to anal bleeding and excretion during sex. It is also common for those who participate in repeated anal sex to lose control of bowel movements. Furthermore, those who participate in anal sex are at a much higher risk of colon cancer, not to mention the prevalence of HIV infection, alcohol and substance abuse, and suicide in the gay community.

What makes a sin sinful?

Arbitrary lines? No
Fun things? No
That which will hurt us

[Notes]
Finally, a conversation about morality and sin requires us to ask at some level, what make a sin sinful? For the most part, these are not just arbitrary lines that God drew to make our lives difficult, nor did He pick a bunch of things that He thought we might enjoy and then call them sin so that it would be harder to follow Him. God calls sin that which would hurt us. He tells us not to do certain things because they will hurt us. Because God loves us, He wants good things for us. God declared in the Bible that homosexual activity is wrong to protect us from all of the destruction readily observable in the gay community and listed above. Note, that I do not believe that these things are a form of God’s punishment. But, unfortunately, these are the results of the actions taken and the reasons why God warned us not to partake.

Who should I love? How? What will make me happiest?

Created for perfect intimacy with Him and His family
We all have intimacy needs
Marriage not necessary to meet needs


[Notes]
Those are important aspects of this conversation to consider, but the questions that are most relevant to where the conversation is today around homosexuality are about love. Who should I love? How? What will make me happiest? 
 
We should recognize that God created us for intimacy. His ultimate plan is for us to enjoy perfect intimacy with Him and his family in Heaven. We all have intimacy needs with the same and opposite sex. That is normal and good, because God created us to live in community and enjoy real, meaningful, intimate relationships. It is best for us to satisfy those intimacy needs in healthy ways. For some, a way they enjoy intimacy with the opposite sex is in Christian marriage, but a romantic or sexual relationship is not necessary to fulfill our needs. Unfortunately, the Church has contributed to the glorification of marriage over singleness by disregarding the commitment and burden involved in marriage—as the divorce rate makes obvious—and disregarding the blessings of singleness. This has led to this feeling that we all must be married and need marriage to be happy—but that is not true.

Yes, God created us for intimacy, but what will make us happy is not sex with a person we are attracted to--what will make us happiest will be intimacy with our friends in family in proper ways
