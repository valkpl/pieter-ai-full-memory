My closet wounds



Unhealthy coping mechanisms
Shame
Depression
Fear
Hiding

[Notes]
And when I realized in 6th grade that I was physically, sexually attracted to other guys I was ashamed and terrified that others would find out
I analyzed how I spoke and how I walked and how I acted when I was around a guy I was attracted to
I wrote out mental scripts for how to pretend like I too was attracted to girls and watching straight porn when the topics came up among my guys friends
I forced myself to date some of these girls to throw people off my trail
Despite having back-to-back lead roles in school plays, I quick theater when the gay theater kid stereotype hit our school
I would argue against the legalization of gay marriage in history class and use fairly homophobic arguements because certainly, some super-Jesusy guy who played soccer and dated girls and spoke critically of gay people couldn’t possible be a gay person
One moment from high school cross country particularly sticks out
We were doing partner stretching on the starting line before the race, like we usually do
But this week was different, because another guy on the team had just come out as gay
He was the first person in our school to do so
So when he asked guys to partner stretch with him, one after another, they said some version of, “No, gross. I don’t want to touch you and I don’t want you touching me.”
Then he got to me, and I sheepishly refused as well
I dished out the same pain I had spent tears and prayers trying to soothe
Growing up, all I'd ever heard from Christians was that God hates gay people
I knew how my pastors and parents talked about the politics of gay marriage and gay pride parades
If people knew who I was, I would be rejected or sent to a pray-the-gay away therapist or both
so I never told anyone for 5 years
But that secrecy was lonely
Spending all of those years trying to make sense of my sexual alone was painful
I started to deal with deep shame because I thought it was my fault that I was gay and that God and my parents wouldn’t love me if I was gay
I slipped into some sinful habits to try to number my shame and loneliness, and I start to develop symptoms of depression
I wish my parents or a youth pastor or a teacher or a school counselor would have spoken carefully about these topics and made it safe for me to share
So that I didn’t have to make sense of this alone
But no one did
And when I did tell someone for the first time 5 years later, my parents did indeed send me to a pray-the-gay-away therapist




The stats



Puberty starts: 8-14
Girls Avg. start: 11
Boys Avg. start: 12
Avg. years between recognizing SSAs & sharing with teacher/parent:
Avg. age teen will share with teacher/parent: 
8 - 14
11
12
5
16

[Notes]
Now times have changed since I was a kid
While some of your students might face the same risks I did
Others of your students find themselves in opposite circumstances
In friend circles and a popular culture that encourages progressive sexual ethics
Regardless, it’s dangerous to leave kids to make sense of their sexality without the love and wisdom of their parents, teachers, and ultimately God
According to the National Health Service, most kids begin puberty between ages 8 and 14. Girls on average begin puberty at 11 and boys on average begin puberty at 12. And according to Mark Yarhouse, teens wait an average of 5 years after recognizing same-sex attractions before telling a parent or pastor. On average, the boys and girls in your school who develop same-sex attractions will recognize those attractions at age 11 but wait until age 16 to share about that experience with you.




The risk of waiting



5 years of making sense of their sexuality alone
Without the love and wisdom of parents/teachers
Alone with the lies of the Enemy and of culture

[Notes]
So if you wait to share about God’s love and wisdom for gay people until teens disclose their sexual attractions to you, you risk leaving teens to make sense of their sexuality alone for 5 years. You leave them without the love and wisdom of pastors and parents, alone with the lies of the Enemy and culture. 




The risk of waiting



Leads to loneliness, anxiety, shame, depression, sexual sin, abandoning God's wisdom, addiction, suicide, and loss of faith
Lingering wounds of the closet greatest barrier to thriving according to God’s wisdom

[Notes]
These fives years in the closet often leads to loneliness, anxiety, shame, depression, sexual sin, abandoning God's wisdom, addiction, suicide, and loss of faith. As I’ve met with dozens of individuals in counseling and pastoral care over the past decade, I’ve become convinced that the lingering wounds of the closet are the greatest barrier to gay Christians thriving according to a traditional sexual ethic. Too many will spend a lifetime attempting to heal those wounds, haunted by the closet.

Even if churches are faithful to teach God's love and wisdom for gay people in compassionate ways, even if pastors know how to provide effective one-on-one pastoral care, and even if churches grow to offer more family in the body of Christ—even if we do all of those, if kids continue spending five years in the closet, we may see little improvement in the thriving of gay Christians or the fruitfulness of their stewardship. The wounds of the closet will block them from the love of Jesus and the love of their brothers and sisters in Christ.





Prevent & Promote



We must prevent the wounds of the closet and promote sexual faithfulness

				How?

[Notes]
Instead, we must prevent the wounds of the closet. The risk is too great not to! But we don't have to stop at just preventing. We can go further and lead students in thriving according to God's wisdom. How? 



Prevent & Promote



How?
Share about God’s love and wisdom before puberty
Demonstrate safety
Encourage to share early
Connect students with biblical resources early

[Notes]
How? We can share about God's love and wisdom before puberty, demonstrate safety, and encourage students to share, all so that students disclose to teachers and parents as soon as they recognize they same-sex attractions so they can access biblical resources that support thriving.




Gender identity…



Preliminary identification: early as 3
Increased distress with social differentiation: age 7

We’ll focus on questions of sexual identity today.

pieterLvalk.com/kychristian

[Notes]
And that’s just with respect to sexual orientation, same-sex attraction, and sexual minorites. If you include questions of gender, the need to lead our students to think biblically about how and what God created them for is even more urgent. Children can begin identifying as one gender or another as early as age 3, but distress from perceived gender dysphoria intensifies by age 7 when boys and girls differentiate socially. Unfortunately, I’m still in the latter stages of developing Equip’s content on ministering to students navigating gender identity questions, so I’m not quite ready to offer advice on that topic. But, if you scan the QR code and signup for notes from this presentation, I’ll also make sure you get updates when our trans content launches.



Share



What resistance might you experience from parents to sharing in age-appropriate ways before students start puberty?
Is the effort to engage that resistance worth protecting students from these wounds?

Today’s goals



Schedule of age-appropriate objectives and scripts
How to respond when students comes out

[Notes]
Okay, so with our time today, I want to suggest a schedule of objectives and scripts for having age-appropriate conversations with your students about God’s love and wisdom for sexual minorities. And I want to prepare you to respond effectively when student share with you that they’re experiencing same-sex attractions.
Objectives + Scripts for Early Conversation
When a Student Comes Out



PREVENTING WOUNDS




Teaching schedule



2nd Grade: basic teaching about God’s design, sadness that designs are bent, & invite to share

4th Grade: early convo about celibacy/marriage, name broken sexuality, & invite to share

6th Grade: God’s love and wisdom for sexual minorities and demonstrate safety

[Notes]
Here’s brief overview of that schedule:
During 2nd grade, you can teach in very basic and preliminary ways about God’s good design for our bodies and our capacities for friendship and family, the sadness that God’s good designs have been bent, and an invitation to share with you if they notice any of this brokenness in their lives or those around them.
During 4th grade, in anticipation that many will have already started puberty and may begin noticing same-sex attractions soon, you can teach in more complex ways about vocational singleness and Christian marriage, describe more directly different ways our sexualities are broken, reassure students that it’s not their fault if they’re experiencing any of those forms of brokenness, and again invite them to share.
And finally during 6th grade, you can teach about God’s love and wisdom for sexual minorities in the fullest ways, demonstrating safety and urging those experiencing brokenness not to make sense of their sexuality or gender alone.

Again, our goal is to guide their understanding before they start asking questions and before culture or their friends or the Enemy start answering those questions for them.




A better story



God created all of us to enjoy human intimacy in the context of lifelong, lived-in family.
God designed two best ways for us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family: vocational singleness and Christian marriage.

[Notes]
Briefly, here’s “The Better Story” we want to offer our students for God’s wisdom for everyone’s sexual stewardship in age-appropriate ways:
God created all of us to enjoy human intimacy in the context of lifelong, lived-in family.
God designed two best ways for us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family: vocational singleness and Christian marriage.
One day you will get to ask God whether He wants you to seek vocational singleness or Christian marriage.
Humanity’s sin bent and broke the goodness of everything God created, including how all of us do intimacy and family. The broken sexuality of another may hurt you, or you may notice that your own sexuality is broken in painful ways. When you do, I hope you share with me. I promise to listen, comfort, and support you.
If you realize your sexuality is broken, God isn’t surprised or disappointed in you. Instead, God offers His wisdom through the Bible and the Church for how you can enjoy beauty and goodness in this broken world. If you follow God’s wisdom, you’ll find the greatest joy, the deepest meaning, and the richest belonging.

How can we lead?



In 2nd Grade, ask: “What is real love?”
You’ll likely get a wide variety of answers, some funny, some sobering. Among other definitions, we know that God is love, and we know that His love is self-giving. We know that we were created in God’s image and that our love should reflect His.
You can respond: “God is love! And…”

[Notes]
Now that we know the objectives, how can we lead these conversations?
I’m going to walk us through 3 examples, one from each grade-level
And then I’m going to send you back to your tables to review different conversation guides and report out
Here’s an example of a class conversation you can have in 2nd Grade:
Ask: “What is real love?”
You’ll likely get a wide variety of answers, some funny, some sobering. Among other definitions, we know that God is love, and we know that His love is self-giving. We know that we were created in God’s image and that our love should reflect His.
You can respond: “God is love! And part of the way He showed us love is that He gave us a way to know Him through Jesus, His Son. God’s perfect love is generous and always giving. We were created in God’s image, which means that He created us to reflect, or be like, Him. And part of being like Him is loving the way He loves.
“But do you remember the story about Eve in the Garden, and how the snake tricked her into eating the fruit God told her not to eat? When sin came into the world through Adam and Eve’s disobedience, it broke everything. We experience this brokenness, too. We can love others, but our love isn’t perfect like God’s love. Our friendships and our relationships with our family are broken, too, because of sin. That brokenness sometimes causes us to be selfish or try to use our friends or family for our own purposes. And sometimes we want to love other people, but we want to love them in ways that are outside of God’s design. But God is good, and He is always working to “make the sad things come untrue” (Jesus Storybook Bible) in our world, including how we love others.”
 
In a followup conversation, you can share the following:
“We talked earlier about how brokenness and sin will affect all of our relationships, even our friendships and our families. I want to explain how brokenness and sin are different. When I say ‘sin,’ I’m talking about when we disobeying of God’s law. If I lie to you, I have sinned against God and you. But when I say ‘brokenness’ I mean what happened when sin entered the world through Adam and Eve. ‘God’s creation would start to unravel, and come undone, and go wrong’ (Jesus Storybook Bible). The world is broken; that’s the reason we have destructive weather, disease, suffering, death, and more. A brokenness isn’t us choosing to disobey. Women who can’t have babies, people who are sick, people who are blind or deaf-- none of those are chosen by the person who experiences them. When you experience brokenness in your life, I want you to know that it’s not your fault and I hope you’ll tell me about it.”




How can we lead?



In 4th Grade, continue: “We talked earlier about how brokenness and sin will affect all of our relationships, even our friendships and our families. I want to explain how brokenness and sin are different. When I say ‘sin,’ I mean a willful disobeying of God’s law. If I lie to you, I have sinned against God and you. But…”

[Notes]
Then in 4th grade, building on the same concepts. You’ll see some reiteration here but also more complex development:
“We talked earlier about how brokenness and sin will affect all of our relationships, even our friendships and our families. I want to explain how brokenness and sin are different. When I say ‘sin,’ I mean a wilful disobeying of God’s law. If I lie to you, I have sinned against God and you. But when I say ‘brokenness’ I mean what happened when sin entered the world through Adam and Eve. ‘God’s creation would start to unravel, and come undone, and go wrong’ (Jesus Storybook Bible). The world is broken; that’s the reason we have destructive weather, disease, suffering, death, and more. A brokenness isn’t a wilful disobedience on our part. Women who can’t have babies, people who are sick, people who are blind or deaf-- none of those are chosen by the person who experiences them. When you experience brokenness in your life, I want you to know that it’s not your fault, and I hope you’ll tell me about it.
“I want to talk to you for a minute about how sin and brokenness can show up in your life, especially in your relationships, because, unfortunately, brokenness will affect your life at some point. Even when we’re faithful and love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, the sin of others and the brokenness of our own body and the world we live in can harm you and make your life painful. I don’t want you to have to face that pain alone. If you ever want to share but you have a difficult time, you could say, ‘Hey, Mommy, do you remember that weird conversation we had about God and relationships? I need your help but I don’t know how to say it.’ And I’ll be right here to listen to you.
“So there are lots of ways sin and brokenness can affect our relationships. You can sin (willfully disobey God’s commands) against others by thinking someone’s appearance is more important than their character, by making inappropriate jokes, or by choosing to ignore someone when they tell you ‘no.’
“Someone else could sin against you by thinking that your appearance is more important than your character, by touching your private parts, by showing you inappropriate pictures, by ignoring you when you say ‘no.’
“Sometimes we don’t sin, but we do experience unchosen brokenness: the way you see yourself may not fit the body you were born with; you look like a boy/girl, but you don’t feel like a boy/girl on the inside. Or maybe you start to feel like you’re attracted to boys/girls rather than girls/boys the way other boys/girls your age are. If you ever experience this kind of brokenness in your life, I want you to know that it’s not your fault, and I hope you’ll tell me about it. All of us have unchosen brokennesses; those are nothing to be ashamed of. I know it’s not your fault, and I won’t be disappointed in you when you share those with me.”
 
What unchosen brokenness are your students already aware of in their school or community that you could point out (in a non-shaming way)?
Here’s an example my coworker Amber gives: For example, my daughter has a dental condition called enamel hypoplasia. She didn’t choose that condition; she was born with it. As a result of that condition, her teeth will require extra care and treatment throughout her lifetime. While her teeth have nothing to do with relationships, I can use this brokenness in her to point out that unchosen brokennesses are nothing to be ashamed of, that God expects us to steward our bodies according to His wisdom despite any brokenness, that she can share any other brokenness with me when she discovers them, and that God loves her completely regardless of the ways she experiences brokenness.




How can we lead?



In 6th Grade, continue: “A lot of the movies and tv shows we watch, songs we listen to, and books we read would have us believe that we need a romantic relationship to thrive. It’s easy to look at what culture teaches and what the Church practices and think that romance and marriage will cure our loneliness and…”

[Notes]
Then in 6th grade, we can have even more complex conversations. Here’s an example of conversation about romance and marriage expectations:
Perhaps after watching a video or reading a book that features a romantic relationship and ended in a “happily-ever-after.”
“A lot of the movies and tv shows we watch, songs we listen to, and books we read would have us believe that we need a romantic relationship to thrive. It’s easy to look at what culture teaches and what the Church practices and think that romance and marriage will cure our loneliness and make us happy. We might think that since we want to have sex and want to be married and want to have children, God must also desire those things for us. But those desires don’t equal a calling from God to marriage. Our own sense of what God has given us a passion for and the ways He wants us to serve in His kingdom can be clues to His preferred vocation for us, but we can’t omit the discernment process. Our first preference may not be God’s preference.”
You tween or teen may have strong objections. “I want to get married and I want to be a parent! Being single would be so hard. I can’t do that my entire life! God would be so mean to ask that of me.”
“You’re right, lifetime singleness would be hard. Lifetime marriage would be hard, too. No human has what it takes to do either marriage or singleness well; we all need provision from God to thrive in our relational vocation. Sometimes we don’t even want to submit this question to God at all because we don’t believe that singleness for the sake of the kingdom is actually good, that it can’t possibly bring us the same satisfaction that romance, marriage, and sex could. But when we say that, we’re actually calling God a liar. We can share our preference with God, but ultimately we should seek to learn what God’s preference is and ask Him to conform our desires to His desires.”

Okay, so let’s say you and your fellow teachers do an AMAZING job leading these conversations in 2nd grade, 4th grade, and 6th grade, such that when students start going through puberty, some of them notice same-sex attractions, and they share with you about those same-sex attractions pretty early, how can you respond in a way that sets them up to embrace God’s love and wisdom for gay people according to a traditional sexual ethic and thrive for years to come?

I can’t possible give you all you need to learn to do that well in our last 10 minutes
But I can offer some quick Don’ts, Do’s, and better questions for conversation immediately after students share
And if you follow that link to signup for followup, I’ll send you lots of free resources for discipling gay teens




Don’t…



Make language a barrier to discipleship
Homosexual
Love the sinner, hate the sin
Struggler, gay lifestyle, lifestyle choice, sexual preference
Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve
Instead, practice Term-Mirroring

[Notes]
DONT
don't make language a barrier to discipleship
-“homosexual” is perceived as clinical or judgemental
-“love the sinner, hate the sin” suggests that merely experiencing same-sex attractions is a sin
-“struggler” “gay lifestyle” “lifestyle choice” “sexual preference” all hint at blaming the lgbt person for their attractions or suggest that sexual orientation is a choice
-“Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve”
instead practice term mirroring (listen to whatever words the student is using and use those same words, even if they aren’t the words you prefer. You’re not affirming that those are the right words. You’re just avoiding terminology as a roadblock to more important conversations about God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship. Admittedly, there’s debate about the best words for gay Christians to use to describe themselves. I’m not going to get into that here, but I will include in my followup email a 4-part exploration of the best words to use in ministry and why)
ask questions, but don't assume the child is just confused and don't try to convince them that they're straight
-don't allow yourself to see the student in a one-dimensional way, as just the gay kid
-don't associate this kid with gay pride parades or militant gay rights organizations or public displays of sexual promiscuity--your kids are just kids
-Don’t ask the person to hide his or her sexual orientation
-Don’t out the person without permission
-Don’t suggest that the person can change their orientation or “pray away the gay” - studies show that sexual orientation change efforts are harmfully ineffective
-Don’t imply that a person is choosing to experience same-sex attraction - people do not choose thei sexual attractions
-Don’t blame the “gay agenda” for someone’s orientation
-Resist making sin comparisons; they just don’t work, and they’re often offensive.
-don't assume that every gay kid is attracted to every kid of the same sex




Don’t…



Assume the child is confused
See the student as “just the gay kid”
Associate w/ pride parades or gay rights Ask to hide sexual orientation

Do!



Cultivate relationship
Make eye contact, smile, listen well
Be sincere as you draw out their story
Show affection (as appropriate)
Express acceptance, even while holding on to our beliefs

[Notes]
DOS
-Cultivate relationship
-Listen well – make eye contact, smile, genuinely listen.  
-Be curious – be sincere as you draw out their story in their own words.  
-Show affection – as appropriate, offer physical and verbal affection
-We should strive to express acceptance, even while holding on to our beliefs: “I care for you.  I will always care you. I am so thankful you told me. You are very brave. I am going to walk with you no matter what.  I really want to hear your whole story.” 
-Help students build a secure system of support. Parents, other family members, pastors, counselors, mentors, peers (depending on age, allow but do not encourage peer support; immature peers sometimes gossip, tease, or reject). Teens and young adults who have strong systems of support have better long-term mental and emotional health outcomes.

Non-anxious space



“Could I encourage you to focus on Jesus, because God understands your pain, the hypocrisy of the Church, much better than I do. Ultimately Jesus suffered more pain than any other human, and His suffering—at the hands of religious elites—was more unfair than anything anyone else has experienced..”

[Notes]
and then provide patient, non-anxious space for kids to be in process and for you to lead them to see God's wisdom as good and embrace it
You can say something like this:
“Could I encourage you to focus on Jesus, because God understands your pain, the hypocrisy of the Church, much better than I do. Ultimately Jesus suffered more pain than any other human, and His suffering—at the hands of religious elites—was more unfair than anything anyone else has experienced. Jesus gets it. He wants to lead you with love—tough love sometimes, but love—because Jesus gets it. He is patient, and I’ll try to be patient too. No matter what you believe or what kind of relationships you’re in, I will continue to meet with you if you want to, pray with and for you, ask you questions, share with you what I understand about Jesus, and remind you that God loves you and wants you to have the fullest life.
In the meantime, I’d encourage you to steward your sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic, even if you aren’t convinced of it, because while it will be a difficult path, I’m convinced the other paths will be even more painful and unsatisfying. And regardless, can I encourage you to lean into intimate friendships with other students? Can I challenge you to take risks by asking for what you need? And when those friendships provide what you need, could I invite you to see that as God providing the companionship you need through the body of Christ?”




Still not convinced?



Recent Barna study found that 39% of Gen Zs identify at LGBTQ

Does this mean 39% have SSAs, are asexual, or clinical gender dysphoria?

Probably not. 

[Notes]
I want to close by reminding us of the need for these conversations
We’ve already talked about the wounds of the closet we’ve got to avoid
And the opportunity to lead our students to embrace God’s love and wisdom for gay people according to a traditional sexual ethic
If you needed more reason, A recent study by George Barna and Arizona Christian University found that 28% of millennial Christians identify as LGBTQ and 39% of all U.S. Gen Zs identify as LGBTQ.
Does this mean that 39% of GenZers have either robust same-sex attractions, no sexual attraction, or feel strongly that they were born the wrong biological sex.
Probably not
More are identifying as queer for 4 reasons:
Genuine queer experience and less barriers to coming out
Queer identification increasingly ore about social/cultural identity than a reflection of sexual/gender orientation
Widespread latent fluidity in women is now being expressed as bisexuality
Girls+boys are identifying as trans to buck gender norms but 90% comfortable w/ their biosex



Still not convinced?

Regardless, more kids are identifying as LGBTQ

Past strategies of doubting disclose will only lead to worse results in the future

[Notes]
Regardless, more kids are identifying as LGBTQ
In the past, parent and teachers have resisted students identifying as queer. Some imagined the hardships that might come with being LGBTQ and hoped students wouldn't have to endure that pain. Others feared that if kids became convinced they were gay, gay romance (and eventually sex) was inevitable. In many ways, we bought into the idea that we can't help but follow the cultural scripts associated with our sexual orientation. Gay people will have gay sex. Straight people will have straight sex. The only way to keep kids from gay sex is to convince them that they're not gay.
This strategy has had mixed results, at best. When we insisted that kids weren’t really gay, this tends to lead kids to distrust parents and teachers and rely more heavily on other sources of wisdom. If a majority of the next generation identifies as LGBTQ, convincing most kids that they are straight and cisgender is going to work.




Instead, teach!



Share about God’s love and wisdom before puberty
Demonstrate safety
Encourage early sharing
Guide students to embrace God’s wisdom and thrive
pieterLvalk.com/kychristian

[Notes]
Instead we’ve got to teach kids in age-appropriate ways about God’s wisdom for everyone sexual stewardship before puberty, demonstrate safety, and invite kids to share early if they notice same-sex attractions
If we do this right, students will share early and you’ll get to help them make sense of their sexuality in Scripture and prayer
and ultimately empower teens to embrace a traditional sexual ethic and thrive according to God’s good and weighty wisdom for a lifetime.
