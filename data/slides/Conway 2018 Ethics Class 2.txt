Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of abstinent singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to lifelong marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Others called to celibacy and intimate family in the Body of Christ

[Notes]
On Wednesday we talked about Jesus and Sexuality
Specifically, in contrast to Mere Sexuality, we demonstrated that celibacy is an equally normative vocation as marriage is light of Christ’s words, life, death, and resurrection
So what does a vocation of celibacy look like? And how can our churches support celibate people?

Here is my outline for how I believe God calls all people to steward their sexualities
If I had time we would tease out each of these, their purposes, etc., but for now, I just want to share what “orthodoxy” is on the paths of sexual stewardship

I do want to talk specifically about what it looks like to do celibacy well



Called to Celibacy



Celibacy is NOT a call to loneliness for the sake of the gospel

Celibacy IS a call to diverse, intimate, and spiritually procreative relationships that are maintained by commitment and sacrifice

[Notes]
celibacy is NOT a call to loneliness for the sake of the Gospel
celibacy is still a call to diverse, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment and sacrifice

Those 5 elements describe the love in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church
There are specific ways Christian marriage embodies those 5 elements and gospel

And celibacy also embodies those 5 elements and the gospel
Celibacy is also a call to family!



Called to Celibacy



Unique benefits:
Deeper friendship
Greater possibility for spiritual parenthood, church leadership, and healing of broken families
Can take greater risks for the gospel

[Notes]
celibacy offers some unique benefits:
deeper friendship
greater possibility for spiritual parenthood, leadership in the church, and the healing of broken families
able to take greater risks for the sake of the Kingdom (missionaries in dangerous places or experiments in community living)
and these are different than abstinent singleness (we all need to be good a cultivating friendship)



Called to Celibacy



Providing spaces for celibates to thrive is part of the Church’s DNA
Honor and support celibacy in practical and structural ways
Embrace and thrive in the calling
Celibacy and marriage are equal with different advantages and challenges

[Notes]
doing celibacy well was easy in a time and place where everyone lived in multi-family, multi-generational homes
but the wealth of our society has made that uncommon, if not weird
so how do we do this in a modern context?
we need a new narrative for this, a modern narrative for a modern problem
yet we aren’t without examples—creating space for celibate people dates back to the early church
the gospel called people to have one wife, which led to many widows
in Acts 6, the church accepted the responsibility to create space for those widows and provide for them
that is in the DNA of the Church

For those called to celibacy, the Church must honor and support that calling in practical and structural ways so that they can meet their intimacy needs in healthy ways.
Those who find themselves in continued celibacy, despite their desire to be married (whether because they are not yet married, widowed, divorced, or are sexual or gender minorities that believe they should not marry), will benefit from accepting their present circumstances, embracing their current calling, and learning to thrive in it.
These individuals may find it comforting (or discouraging) that Jesus recognized that some will be called to celibacy involuntarily but should accept and embrace their circumstances nonetheless.
We must recognize and teach that celibacy and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges.






Model it – church leadership
Talk about it – across the lifespan
Discern it – listen and accept the call
Support it – integrate tem in families
Celebrate it – show that it is valued
Thriving in Celibacy

[Notes]
model it
put celibate people in places of leadership and up front
unless see it valued won’t believe it is really a great option

talk about it across the lifespan
children need celibacy to be mentioned every time they talk about marriage
they need to have celibate people in their families
we need to preach about it
there need to be catechism opportunities around it

need a process of discernment to help accept a call to it

support it
they need intimate, spiritually procreative, and covenant-bound relationships that are maintained through sacrifice
people need to be given a vision of it and called to it
provide incubator where risk is reduced (subsidize it)
give instructions to make it happen
hold people accountable
seek out celibate people in the church and ask them about their experience
church language (“if” instead of “when”)

celibates as Godparents
calling families to include in rhythms, vacations, holidays, living
rhythms in the church to make this happen
help celibates create families of their own

celebrate it
mother’s day, father’s day, anniversaries, marriages, engagement parties, baptism, baby showers
what for celibates? how do we mark and celebrate their commitment?



Why does it matter?



Both are about embodying the gospel:
Diverse, intimate, and procreative relationships maintained by commitment and sacrifice point to the Trinity and Christ + the Church
Celibacy reflects Christ’s life and future patters in the New Heaven and New Earth

[Notes]
why is Christian orthodoxy about sexual stewardship important?
they are both ultimately about embodying the gospel and that makes it a gospel issue
all: we are all made for diverse, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment and hospitality that ultimately point to God’s love in the Trinity and for His people
celibate: reflects christ’s life and our future patterns in the NHNE



Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of abstinent singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to lifelong marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Others called to celibacy and intimate family in the Body of Christ

[Notes]
So to recap

God offers relationship with Him and the Body of Christ as the solution to loneliness
Spiritual friendship is a satisfying source of companionship available to all
Marriage is a vocation for the purpose of raising children
God calls many to a flourishing life of celibacy
All enjoy deep friendship in the Body of Christ and support each other in their vocations



Share
If our churches modeled, taught, supported, and celebrated celibacy in these ways, would it be as satisfying as romance, marriage, and sex?

If a significant minority of straight Christians accepted a call to celibacy (~13%), how would that change our churches’ response?






THE PROBLEM




The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
We don’t really believe those things
Few churches teach those things
And even fewer put them into practice

[Notes]

we don’t really believe those things
few churches truly teach these things
and even fewer put them into practice



The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
Straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage
There is no support for celibacy
We live disconnected, isolated lives

[Notes]
we don’t refrain from emotional and physically intimate relationships before marriage
we assume we will be married, that marriage will satisfy, and that marriage is about making you happy
we no longer honor “through thick and thin” or see raising children as central
straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage

few consider celibacy as a calling
relegated to a curse of loneliness for the sake of the gospel
there is no support for celibacy because straight people aren't doing it

don’t learn to do friendship well, have loose friendships
fear of close, same-sex friendships
don’t do life as a Body of Christ



The Problem(s)



This hurts Christians who experience SSA
Cannot thrive in celibacy or a MOM
We offer only Side A or Side X
Why should gay people be called to a higher standard of sexual stewardship?

[Notes]
we don’t offer an alternative that recognizes the challenges and answers questions people have

if we do not do this, we cannot blame unmarried people for reaching out for forbidden things from a place of loneliness

if straight people aren’t taking marriage seriously or considering celibacy, why should gay people call themselves to a higher standard of sexual stewardship



The Problem(s)



This hurts straight Christians, too
Children grow up hearing all people will be straight, married, and have kids
Failed marriages due to refusing a call to celibacy and inaccurate expectations
Celibates struggle with loneliness and married people raise children alone



Share
How have you seen these shortcomings in your community?

How have they impacted Christians in your community—both gay and straight?






CHRISTIAN

& GAY?

[Notes]
Like my clickbat title slide?
Let’s change gears, although in a related way
If Mere Sexuality had treated celibacy differently—held it up as normative and convicted the Church for its failure to support celibacy
How should our theology of sexual stewardship for all people inform how we think about LGBT+ people in the Church?



SIDE A, B, & X


[Notes]
Let’s outline the different camps for how Christians think about this theologically (Side A, B, X)
Value-neutral language popularized by the Gay Christian Network



Side A



God makes people gay
God blesses same-sex marriages in the same ways that He blesses opposite-sex marriages
Requires theological maneuvering or a belief that the Bible is not binding/prescriptive for a modern context 



Side B



Same-sex attraction is a result of the Fall
We do not choose who we are attracted to and there is no formula for changing one’s attractions
Same-sex romantic and sexual activity are sins
All people are called to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Christians can identify as gay in limited ways




Side X



Same-sex attracted Christians must reject their attractions and work toward change
Continuing to experience SSA is a sign of willful disobedience
Homosexuality is sinful
God intends for all people to marry someone of the opposite sex



Share



Which “Side” makes the most sense to you and why? How is that informed by the Bible? Christian teaching over the past 2,000 years? Culture?
35



WHY SIDE B?


[Notes]
and then share why I’ve arrive at the beliefs I have



Honestly, I wish…



Most Side A gay Christians I know are no longer Christians
Straight Christians with a Side A perspective can keep doubt of the Bible’s authority in a box
Gay Christians cannot, and the result is destructive for the foundation of their faiths

[Notes]
I wish I could convince myself of Side A and I wish I was confident that would turn out well for me
But anecdotally, a vast majority of the gay Christians I know that went Side A eventually stopped being a Christian all together
How can that be?
As we pointed out earlier, a Side A perspective either requires some nuanced theological maneuvering or believing that the Bible is no longer binding or prescriptive
straight people can have these doubts about Scripture specifically around homosexuality but put that in a box and keep it from impacting the way the Bible informs their faith generally
But a gay Christian with a Side A perspective can’t do that
That person can’t keep doubt of the Bible’s authority in a box
For an evangelical who was taught that the Bible is the foundation of one’s faith
Coming to the conclusion that the Bible is not informative for a modern context is distressingly disruptive
That is what has led to most of my Side A friends losing their faith altogether

But even if that wasn’t the case, I can’t get myself their logically
I can’t get the Bible or Christian teaching to allow me



Why Side B?



Preponderance of Biblical support

Same-sex sexual activity is sin (Romans 1; Leviticus 18:22; Leviticus 20:13; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10) 

Marriage defined between man and women (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-5) 

Context of rape, incest, adultery, or sex outside of marriage (Genesis 19:1-9) 

Written for a people in a time and place

[Notes]
So first let’s look at what the Bible has to say

Preponderance, not certainty
So we need more



Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of abstinent singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to lifelong marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Others called to celibacy and intimate family in the Body of Christ

[Notes]
And that’s why getting this right is so important
Historical, orthodox Christian teaching about how we are all called to steward our sexualities make up for that uncertainty



Share
If the narrative for sexual stewardship I shared is orthodoxy, how does that inform how we respond to same-sex attraction? What does that mean for same-sex sexual and romantic intimacy? Same-sex marriage? What is God offering those who experience same-sex attraction? Is it good?



44

[Notes]
That’s a big IF



Why Side B?
Same-sex attraction is not God’s intention and is a result of the Fall
Same-sex sexual/romantic activity is sinful
God does not bless same-sex marriages because they fall outside of God’s design for marriage
There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses




[Notes]
We don’t even need to clobber passages to arrive at 3 and 4, which highlights that regardless of debate around their specific meaning, the broader narrative of scripture does not bless same-sex marriage



Why Side B?



If the Church did this well, it would be a place where those who experience SSA could thrive in celibacy or a mixed orientation marriage (MOM)

Their callings would be just as beautiful and the challenges would be no greater

[Notes]
You might be asking: but how is that good for LGBT+ people?

if the Church did this well
calling just a beautiful and challenges no greater
celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex (just like straight people!)

Again, our argument is that asking whether something is permissible is the wrong question
We should be asking what is most good?
And God’s narrative says that for every person, the most good will be found in a period of abstinent singleness, celibacy, or marriage with someone of the opposite sex done correctly

church where celibacy taught and valued and just as good
other straight people celibate and thriving
church that recognizes brokenness and talks about brokenness of sexuality
also recognizes what marriage really is
so can thrive in MOM

everyone enjoys meaningful community in the Body of Christ



BETTER




A Vision for BETTER



Offer God’s narrative for sexual stewardship for all people
Talk about the people and circumstances in the margins, including SSA
Start talking about this at an early age
Effectively minister to LGBT+ people
Become churches where people can thrive in celibacy and MOMs

[Notes]
In short, if you want to serve LGBT+ people well, it takes more than a pastor who can minister individual to LGBT+ people. That is good, and if that pastor truly grasps the complexity of the problem, he or she can lead that congregation toward a real solution:

We need to offer God’s narrative for sexual stewardship for all people (to parents, from parents to children, to children, to youth, to adults, to leaders, from the pulpit)
We need to be able to talk about the people and circumstances in the margins, including those who experience same-sex attraction (to parents, from parents to children, to children, to youth, to adults, to leaders, from the pulpit)
We need to start talking about this at an early age (train youth pastors, volunteers, parents, and then youth)
We need to effectively minister to those who experience same-sex attraction (train pastors, mentors, and parents)
And if we really believe and teach these things, they will impact our core message, programming, and how we provide support to LGBT+ people, including becoming places where LGBT+ people can thrive in celibacy or a mixed-orientation marriage



Share



If our churches took those 5 steps to become places where LGBT+ Christians could flourish in a traditional sexual ethic, would that make that theology more palatable? What holds you back more: the bad fruit of a traditional sexual ethic or the poor strength of the arguments?

QUESTIONS?




OBJECTIONS


[Notes]
shift gears here for a second and address the most convincing argument for a progressive sexual ethic

Even if we know why we believe what we believe, others’ arguments can be confusing to respond to




Best Side A Objections



Jesus never condemned homosexuality…
The clobber passages are uncertain and unnecessary
The Bible (including Jesus) and the Church have spoken with clarity about what Christian marriage is

[Notes]
jesus never said anything about homosexuality
the Bible isn’t clear on this so should leave this to people and their God
all within context of incest, rape, sex outside of marriage, adultery

yes, the clobber verses alone leave room for uncertainty
Biblical acrobatics
but they aren’t necessary
what is overwhelmingly convincing is what the Bible has to say marriage IS
Jesus named marriage as between a man and a woman
as we shared earlier, the Bible and the Church have spoken with clarity that Christian marriage is a lifetime vocation between a man and a woman to enjoy intimacy and raise children






The Bible doesn’t address gay people or SSM as we think of them today
There have always been gay people
Gay as an identity is created, just like race
God has consistently been against same-sex romantic and sexual activity
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
homosexual orientation/identity didn't exist in Bible times, therefore the Bible wasn’t talked about gay people or same-sex marriage as we think of it today

Let’s be clear, there have always been people who experience same-sex attraction—there have always been gay people
Beyond that, being gay being a different cultural group or a distinct sexuality is something created by man—just like race—to oppress people
And it is true that few people consider the idea of same-sex marriage because there was an assumption that a primary purpose of marriage was procreation
Regardless, God has never been against gay people—he is against same-sex sexual and romantic activity, and that is consistent throughout time






The Bible is wrong on slavery and sexism, so it’s wrong on homosexuality too
The Bible shows a trajectory on racial and gender equality that reflects an accommodating God
The Bible consistently condemns same-sex sexual activity for all people throughout time

Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
gender inequality and slavery

Many argue that the Bible and Christians were wrong about racial and gender equality, and in the same way the Bible and Christians are wrong about homosexuality
But if we take a closer look at how the Bible talks about these three things across the Biblical narrative, we will see something different
God is an accommodating God—instead of calling people to perfection he sometimes calls them to something more good that is in reach or within the bounds of their understanding
The people and place and time that the authors of the Bible spoke into could not have accepted modern ways Christians think about racial and gender equality
But we do see the way God talks about these things in the Bible change over time—they suggest a trajectory toward the ultimate good
Ultimately, the Bible points toward what we believe about racial and gender equality today
However, that same trajectory is not found in how the Bible talks about same-sex sexual activity
It consistently condemns it
God doesn’t seem to be accommodating here, there isn’t a trajectory toward a different, better good
It is a flat line pointing toward the same conclusion throughout time for all people






Celibacy is a choice and works for few
Neither celibacy nor marriage are chosen—they are called, they are given
They are both difficult and rewarding vocations when stewarded faithfully
The Church can better support celibacy
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
no one should be forced into celibacy, and celibacy doesn’t work for everyone

Neither celibacy nor marriage are chosen—they are called, they are given
And just because someone is called to something doesn’t mean it will be easy
Celibacy and marriage are both difficult and rewarding vocations when stewarded faithfully







MOMs are destructive (more later)
MOMs fail because people hide their SSA and couples don’t talk about it
MOMs I know that do this well are thriving more than the average Christian family
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
MOMs are a bad idea

We will talk more about this later, but MOMs fail because the person hides their same-sex attractions or the couple doesn’t share with others
MOMs I know that do this well are thriving more than the average Christian family






Traditional sexual ethics bears bad fruit
Wrong theology or bad application?
The Church isn’t a place where LGBT+ people can thrive in celibacy or a MOM
Plenty of bad fruit of engaging in same-sex sexual and romantic relationships
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
we see the bad fruit of a traditional theology

There is definitely bad fruit (gay teen suicide and hate crime)
The question remains: it is bad fruit of bad theology or bad fruit of bad application?
My hunch is that it is bad fruit of bad application, but the Christians cannot judge people for failing to take hold of something we aren’t offering
It’s on us to become churches where people can thrive in celibacy and MOMs
But if we continue to fail to, we have no one to blame but ourselves
I would also note that there is plenty of bad fruit of engaging in same-sex sexual and romantic relationships and culturally typical expression






Same-sex attraction doesn’t change
Counseling for unwanted SSA is no less effective and no more harmful than the next therapy
Attractions are fluid, but the goal isn’t to make people straight
God calls us to honor Him with our sexual stewardship and thrive
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
reparative therapy doesn’t work and people’s same-sex attraction doesn’t change
psychological community says it isn’t an illness

A lot of misinformation about providing counseling to Christians who identify their same-sex attraction as unwanted
No less effective and no more harmful than the next therapy
While attractions are fluid and most people I know experienced at least a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of their SSA once they started doing some work around their stuff, the goal isn’t to make people straight
The goal is to help people steward their sexualities in God-honoring ways and thrive






God makes people gay (more later)
Genetic + environmental factors contribute to the development of SSA
All of us were corrupted at a genetic level and born into a broken world that further injured us
We do not choose our attractions, and God appreciates the challenges

Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
we know now that same-sex attraction isn’t a choice and significant genetic contributions
God makes people this way so he must be okay with it

We will talk more about this in the next session
But the consensus among scientists is that both genetic factors and environmental factors contribute to the development of SSA
But even if people were born gay, it doesn’t mean God intended people to be gay
None of us are how God imagined us to be—all of us were corrupted at a genetic level and born into a broken world that further injured us
God doesn’t not intend for anyone to experience same-sex attraction or to engage in same-sex romantic or sexual relationships
But we also do not choose who we are attracted to
On God appreciates the challenges those who experience same-sex attraction face in stewarding their sexualities






A loving God wouldn’t deprive us of love
What does it mean to be loving? Willing someone to enjoy the best things God has to offer
Christian orthodoxy informs what those best things are
Love = Orthodoxy + Empathy (helping others told hold of the best things)
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
God is love
love = willing someone to enjoy the best things life has to offer
the best things come from God, so loving someone is willing them to enjoy what God offers
how do we know what those best things are? Christian orthodoxy
but it’s not enough to just point people toward the best things
we have to help people take hold of them
we have to empathize with their experience and be willing to sacrifice to help them thrive
love = empathy orthodoxy
hate without orthodoxy isn’t love
empathy without orthodoxy isn’t love
orthodoxy without empathy isn’t love
If we want to imitate God and love people, we will invite them to take hold of the best things according to Christian orthodoxy and help them do so



Share
What arguments for a progressive sexual ethic are still convincing? Why?






My Beliefs



Experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin. (Matthew 6:12-13; James 1:14-15; Hebrews 4:15) 

Same-sex romantic/sexual activity is a sin. (Romans 1; Leviticus 18:22; Leviticus 20:13; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10) 

God does not promise that a person’s same-sex attraction will change in this lifetime.

We do not choose who we are attracted to, but we choose how we respond.

[Notes]
Ultimately these are my beliefs



My Beliefs



Any sin can separate us from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all. (John 10:28-30; Romans 8:38-39; Ephesians 4:30) 

God promises transformation of the heart and provision of fullness to anyone who seeks Him faithfully. (Ezekiel 36:26) 



My Beliefs



God calls the Church to love those who experience SSA regardless of what their journeys look like. (Hebrews 13; Acts 2: 42-47) 

God loves LGBT+ people and He values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ. (1 Corinthians 12:12-31) 



THE BIBLE?


[Notes]
Briefly look at what the Bible says about same-sex attraction and same-sex marriage

passages and different interpretations



Genesis 19



Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by God for their oppression, adultery, lying, abetting criminals, arrogance, complacency, indifference to the poor, gang rape, homosexual conduct, inhospitality, etc.

In the specific event that led to the cities’ destruction, all of the men of Sodom came to Lot’s house and demanded he hand over the angels in his house who had taken male form so that the men could have sex with them

[Notes]
Some focus on the inhospitality or sexual excess, others focus on the sexual sin and particularly the homosexual conduct




Leviticus 18 and 20



“You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.” (Lev 18: 22)

“If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.” (Lev 20:13)


[Notes]
Some claim these prohibitions are in the context of prostitution or against men playing the passive role in sex, others focus on the same-sex sexual activity




Romans 1:18-32



“Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.” (Romans 1:26-27)

[Notes]
Some focus on this being sexual excess or having sex contrary to one’s orientation, others focus on same-sex attraction being fallen and same-sex sexual activity being sinful




1 Corinthians 6:9-10



“Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.”

[Notes]
“the sexually immoral” = malakoi = effeminate man, passive partner in same-sex sex, male prostitutes
“men who practice homosexuality” = arsenokoitai = general term for same-sex sex
Some claim that Paul is condemning both the active and passive partner in male same-sex sex, others claims that Paul is merely condemning effeminate men and sexual excess



1 Timothy 1:8-10



”The law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine.

[Notes]
Arsenokoitai = “men who practice homosexuality” = all forms of homosexual conduct
