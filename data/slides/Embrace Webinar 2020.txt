SINGLENESS & MARRIAGE


[Notes]
Today I want to explore this question:



Today’s Question



How can our churches become places where gay people could thrive in either vocational singleness or a mixed-orientation marriage with reasonable effort?

[Notes]
How can our churches become places where gay people could thrive in either vocational singleness or a mixed-orientation marriage with reasonable effort?



WHY?


[Notes]
To answer than question, let’s start by asking why we don’t see gay people in our churches thriving in vocational singleness or a mixed-orientation marriage now?



Why no thriving?



Most churches…
Inconsistently apply the Bible’s wisdom about sexual stewardship
Avoid talking about sexuality clearly
Enable gay teens to process alone
Outsource care of gay people
Provide little support for celibate people or mixed-orientation marriages




[Notes]
First, most churches inconsistently apply the Bible’s wisdom about sexual stewardship. Most churches today lead straight Christians to assume that they will get married, teach that we need romantic companionship to be happy, and ignore the Bible’s teachings about vocational singleness and divorce. This leads to high divorce rates and a void of theology and practice of vocational singleness among straight Christians. But then we call same-sex attracted Christians to a higher standard of sexual stewardship by allowing straight Christians to misuse marriage for their romantic fulfillment while asking only same-sex attracted Christians to consider vocational singleness. This is hypocritical, and churches lose any credibility to ask gay Christians to live according to biblical wisdom.

Second, most churches today avoid the topic of God’s love for gay people, so the average church-goer doesn’t know how to have compassionate and theologically accurate conversations with friends. As a result, gay people don’t know whether it is safe to share their story. Churches that sit the fence on this topic hurt same-sex attracted Christians because their indecision limits their ability to invest in something better.

Third, most churches wait until a kid shares that he is gay to address the topic of homosexuality. This is a problem. On average, teens wait five years after first recognizing their same-sex attraction to talk to a parent or pastor. That’s five years that a teen makes sense of these questions alone. Most often, this means that a teen has either developed shame, depression, and suicidality or adopted a progressive sexual ethic (and often both).
 
Fourth, unfortunately, many parents and pastors first react to a teen sharing about his attractions by sending him to a therapist or a parachurch ministry outside of the church to “fix” him. Parents and pastors don’t know how to minister to same-sex attracted people well, so they outsource the care. The shame and loneliness of same-sex attracted people is amplified because their challenges are treated as weird problems that need special treatment. They are told to make sense of a key aspect of their personhood away from the church family they worship with, pray with, and take communion with.
 
Fifth, a lot of churches may have the right beliefs about sexual ethics, but the pathways for sexual stewardship they offer are inviable. They are places where no one is thriving in vocational singleness or the complexities of marriage with someone of the opposite sex. In response to the ways many have misused mixed-orientation marriage, the pendulum has swung the opposite direction and many churches teach that vocational singleness is the only option for same-sex attracted people. But these churches never teach about lifetime singleness, there are no models in their church for doing this well, and they don’t invite straight people to consider vocational singleness. It begs the question: if we aren’t offering vocational singleness to straight people, do we really believe it is good?



Vision for Thriving



Become churches where…
Everyone is thinking theologically about their sexuality
Christians talk publicly about the challenges LGBT+ people face
Every kid knows God loves gay people
Pastors and lay leaders know how to minister to LGBT+ people
LGBT+ people could thrive in vocational singleness or Christian marriage

[Notes]
First, our churches need to invite all Christians to think theologically about their sexual stewardship. We need to teach that God first calls everyone to a period of temporary singleness during which we discern whether we are called to a lifetime vocation of singleness or a lifetime vocation of Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex. Our churches should teach that every Christian has the same inherent capacity for both vocations and every Christian, gay or straight, should offer the question of vocational singleness or Christian marriage to God.
 
Second, our churches must talk publicly about the cultural questions in the intersection of faith and sexuality. With compassion and theological accuracy, they explore the following questions:
How does same-sex attraction develop?
What part did God play and why?
Does same-sex attraction change?
How should gay people meet their intimacy needs?
How do LGBT+ people fit in God’s story?
How is God’s invitation to LGBT+ people good?
As a result, everyone in your church knows how to love LGBT+ people well and reflect the love of Christ in conversations about sexuality. Plus, same-sex attracted people in your church still in the closet will know what you believe, your love for them, and that it is safe to share their story.
 
Third, our churches need to talk about the possibility of same-sex attraction in age-appropriate ways across the lifespan. Before a teen realizes he or she experiences same-sex attraction, the teen hears that gay people don’t choose who they are attracted to, that they have nothing to be ashamed about, that we won’t try to fix them, that we don’t love them any less, and that God has good and beautiful plans for them. Then, when teens realize their same-sex attractions, they quickly share with their parents and pastors, inviting them to help them learn how to steward their sexuality in God-honoring ways.
 
Fourth, our churches must provide effective pastoral care to same-sex attracted Christians. They've done what it takes to gain the competency to provide pastoral care to same-sex attracted people. While licensed counselors still may be included to help address clinical levels of anxiety or depression, these churches recognize that same-sex attractions are not a mental illness to be cured. Parents and pastors help same-sex attracted people integrate their faith and sexuality in ways that lead to thriving in this life and deep relationships with God and friends.
 
Fifth, our churches need to become places where same-sex attracted people could thrive in vocational singleness or Christian marriage with reasonable effort. 

That’s what we’re here to talk about today.

These churches teach about the theology of vocational singleness in Scripture, adults are modeling thriving in vocational singleness and they are celebrated in the church, and the church invites all people—gay or straight—to discern whether God is calling them to vocational singleness or marriage. Most importantly, these churches are places where celibate people can find the same depth of family that married people find, whether that be through intentional Christian communities of celibate (or celibate and married) people or helping celibates move in with marrieds to be a part of their family. Then, these churches teach about the possibility of mixed-orientation marriages for same-sex attracted people, cautioning against getting into these recklessly while highlighting the beauty and brokenness of real stories.



SINGLENESS


[Notes]
So let’s get practical
How can our churches become places where gay people could thrive in either vocational singleness or a mixed-orientation marriage with reasonable effort?

For the rest of our time, we’re going to talk about 5 practical steps your church can take to support vocational singleness
And 5 practical steps your church can take to support mixed-orientation marriages

I want to note that these steps don’t just apply to vocational singleness and Christian marriage involving LGBT+ people
Taking these steps will help your churches become places where all people, gay or straight, can thrive in vocational singleness and marriage



Thriving in Singleness



Teach it – across the lifespan
Model it – church leadership
Celebrate it – show that it is valued
Discern it – listen and accept the call
Support it – integrate them in families






Teach it – 
Across the lifespan, we must share the rich theology of vocational singleness in Scripture.
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
Across the lifespan, we must share the rich theology of vocational singleness in Scripture.

I think the biggest barrier to this is that most pastors don’t really know what the Jesus and Paul had to say about vocational singleness
So they don’t know how to teach about it






Teach it – 
A lifetime vocation of singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
So what should we teach? What did Jesus and Paul really have to say about vocational singleness?
The Church has historically and consistently taught that Matthew 19 and 1 Corinthians 7 are commending a commitment to a lifetime vocation of singleness for the sake of the kingdom
let me break down that phrase “lifetime vocation of singleness for the sake of the kingdom”








“a lifetime calling…”
God calls us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness
God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us
God intended for vocational singleness to be committed and permanent
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling...
it’s a calling
God calls us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness
the Bible teaches that our vocation is given or called, not chosen
God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us
in Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus says that God has called us to either marriage or vocational singleness and given us a capacity to accept Jesus’ teachings about marriage and vocational singleness, according to our calling
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul says that God gives some the gift of vocational singleness and others the gift of marriage
 
but it’s not just a calling, it’s a lifetime calling
God intended for vocational singleness to be committed and permanent
In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus speaks of a call beyond temporary singleness and compares vocational singleness to being a eunuch, a state which is permanent
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul recognizes and praises committed singleness and teaches that it is better to keep a commitment to vocational singleness
 
At this point, I think it’d be helpful to make a distinction between temporary singleness and the vocational singleness I’m talking about here
we are all born into temporary singleness
that’s our default state
and then some of us are called to Christian marriage
and others of us are called to a lifetime vocation of singleness for the sake of the kingdom
 
why is it important to make that distinction?
because there’s a big difference between just waiting for marriage versus accepting a call to permanently give up the prospect of romance, sex, marriage, or children in order to use that availability to do kingdom work parents can’t
My friends in temporary singleness seem to be only shallowly rooted in their spiritual families and the kingdom work they’re doing, because they need to always be prepared to reorganize their lives around a future marriage
and the two passages where Jesus and Paul encourage every Christian to consider singleness aren’t commending temporary singleness
they’re commending vocational singleness
In order to receive the gift from God to do vocational singleness well, we have to step out of temporary singleness and into committed singleness
so I want to particularly focus on vocational singleness, because that’s the one we don’t hear much about in church
Plus, even if you’re only single temporarily, I think there are ways you can borrow from vocational singleness, even if only for a time






“a lifetime calling to singleness…”
A call to give up romance, dating, marriage, and sex
Still a call to intimacy in the context of committed family
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness...
 
Vocational singleness is a call to give up romance, dating, marriage, and sex
but that doesn’t mean that a person is called to loneliness
its still a call to intimacy in the context of committed family
In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus talks about vocational singleness as a giving up of romance, marriage, sex, and children 
and then in Luke 18:28-30, Jesus promises a 100-fold of brothers, sisters, and children now in this present time to those who give up the potential for a spouse and children for the sake of the kingdom
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul confirms that vocational singleness involves giving up sex, romance, marriage, and children but recognizes that those called to vocational singleness still need committed companionship






“a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom”
Do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time and energy to do
Embody the gospel in unique ways
Give every Christian hope for the New Heavens and New Earth 
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
so now we’ve got the “what”
what is vocational singleness
now let’s talk about the “why”
why does God call people to this lifetime vocation of singleness?
 
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.
 
Jesus uses the phrase “for the sake of the kingdom” in Matthew 19:1-12 and Luke 18:28-30 to describe vocational singleness
Those called to vocational singleness do that in three ways:
First, God intended for those in vocational singleness to use their availability, primarily from not raising children, to do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time and energy to do
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul explains that vocational singleness involves giving up a spouse and children to be more concerned with the work of the Church
 
Second, vocational singleness is for the sake of the kingdom because it embodies the gospel in unique ways
Similarly to marriage, vocational singleness is an image of the love of God found in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church that preaches the gospel by pointing us back to the true things that image reflects
vocational singleness is spiritually procreative, sacrificial, committed, intimate, and hospitable, pointing those who see that image back to the original source: God’s love
 
And third, vocational singleness is for the sake of the kingdom because it gives every Christian hope for the New Heavens and New Earth
in Luke 20:34-36, Jesus teaches that all will be celibate in the New Heaven and New Earth
so vocational singleness preaches the gospel in way that marriage does not by serving as a physical sign and hope for how we will all live in the NHNE
Contemporaries of early Christians saw marriage as a necessity to secure physical protection, wealth, and a legacy through descendants. So when Christian celibates fulfilled the promises in Isaiah 56:3-5 and Luke 18:29 by experiencing more family, belonging, and honor than married people; they provided Christians with a preview of and hope for a New Heavens and New Earth where God would keep us safe, provide everything we needed, and would never forget us.
But let me update that for a modern audience. Today, westerners seem interested in romance and marriage because they promise a way to find faithful love and escape loneliness. So modern Christian celibacy can uniquely testify to the fullness of God’s love by previewing a time when we don’t have to compete—to be more attractive or intelligent or funny than others—in order to be loved by others and belong in a family.
Christians today should look at those in vocational singleness, see them enjoying intimate community without the need for romance, exclusivity, or competing for each others’ affection;
and that preview should give every Christian hope for the fullness of God’s love in the kingdom to come.






Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom

Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
so
vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom

every time we talk about marriage, we need to talk about vocational singleness







Model it – 
To imagine a future that is good and valued, children must see celibate people thriving and leading.
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
Vocational singleness must be modeled in our churches

we can only imagine a future for ourselves that we see modeled
we will only imagine that future as good and valuable if it is modeled as being such
so the children in our churches need to see celibate people in our churches thriving
the children in our churches need to see celibate people in places of leadership, upfront, honored






Model it – 
Seek out single people as leaders in your church.
Invite single people into your homes.
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
First, your church can be intentional about seeking out leaders who are single
Not only do our children need to see single people valued and as leaders, but they have so much to offer the church in their singleness
We need single head pastors, preaching pastors, worship leaders, youth pastors, children’s pastors, bible study leaders, small group leaders, Sunday school leaders, mentors, elders, youth volunteers, etc.

Second, Invite single people into your homes to be part of your families
children need to hear and see this done well in their homes so they can imagine it as a good thing for them






Celebrate it – 
Find ways to mark and celebrate the commitments and milestones of celibate people.
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
Celebrate the lives of celibate people

mother’s day, father’s day, anniversaries, marriages, engagement parties, baptism, baby showers
what for celibates? how do we mark and celebrate their commitment?

if there are vows, celebrate and anniversary that ceremony – gather friends and family, witness the individual make commitments to vocational singleness to God, and have a party afterward

by putting in leadership and valuing
honoring/commissioning leaders
what about those occasions that are harder without a spouse: birthdays, holidays, vacations, buy a home, 







Discern it – 
Grow their ”spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Remove any emotional or theological barriers to clear discernment
Consider what kind of work they might be called to
Consider their past and current circumstances
Provide support as a church
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
Help gay people in your church discern whether they are called to vocational singleness or marriage

as we teach people how to think theologically about their sexual stewardship and relational vocation, we need to also invite them to discern that
with parents, with mentors, in prayer and Scripture with the Holy Spirit

Here’s what that could look like practically:

First, Before we start discerning any specific questions, we need to help people develop their ”spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Do they know how to bring a question before God, consider Scripture, consider practical aspects of their question, seek advice from spiritual mentors, arrive at a potential conclusion, hold that conclusion before God, seek confirmation through small steps, and move forward with confidence?
Before we ask a question as important as marriage or vocational singleness, let’s practice our skills of discernment on less consequential decisions
A good book on this is God’s Voice Within

Second, make sure their are no emotional or theological hurdles to either vocation
We want to clear out any biases against either vocation so that we can better receive God’s call
This might look like studying theology of both marriage and vocational singleness to make sure you have a healthy understanding of both
We also need to take care any emotional hurdles, any past experiences that bias us against either vocation on an emotional level
Perhaps for you that’s the idol of romance or divorce in their family
All of these may bias their discernment in harmful ways
So we need to help people work through any biases they might have so they can more clearly hear God’s preference

Third, help them consider what kind of work they might be called to, and see if that points them toward vocational singleness or marriage
If it feels like the primary work they’ve been called to is to raise children for the Church, then they’re probably called to marriage
Or if they feel called to a mission that might be mutually exclusive with raising children
Like a special mission, a difficult ministry, a life of contemplation or study, or monastic life, then they’re probably called to vocational singleness

Fourth, help them consider their past and current circumstances
Have any experiences from their past pointed their toward one vocation or another?
Or perhaps they find yourself single later in life and ask, “I am still single not by accident, but because God has called me to a vocation of singleness?”
I’m not saying that every adult who is single later in life has been called to lifetime singleness
But perhaps if someone is single later in life, that is a sign of God’s intentions

Fifth, provide support as a church in the discernment process. Bring mentors to lead them in this process. Invite feedback from friends and family about their discernment. These people can often provide better advice with an outside perspective.









Support it – 
Help celibate people stay in, join, or build family in the body of Christ.
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
Support celibate people by helping them find family

in general, help them have a better experience of family in the body of Christ
Large church fellowship
Diverse small groups
Invite singles to couples-only activities
Ask single people what they need and how they want to serve
but celibate people need intimate, committed relationships, just like their married friends
They need a family of companions who they know will be there in a decade
The people who will be their for dinner at night, or to hear about their day, or to go on vacation with them

So we can help them find their inner family?






Support it – 
Stay with biological family
Join another nuclear family
Create families of celibate people
Thriving in Singleness

[Notes]
Here’s 3 ways celibate people can find family:

First, we can encourage people to stay deeply connected to their biological family. This might look like living with a parent, a sibling, or a cousin, doing rhythms of family with those people, and committing to helping them raise the children in that household.

Or, you might help single people knit themselves into unrelated nuclear families in your church. Maybe people go out of their way to choose celibate people as godparents for their children. Or you invite single people to weekly dinner with your family. Or include them in holidays and vacations. You could even invite single people to live in your home, commit to your family, and help you raise your kids.

Or third, you can help celibate people create families of their own
Help celibate people gather together and commit to being family for each other and doing rhythms of family together.
This is perhaps the least conventional of the options suggested here, and while it might be the most beautiful, it also involved the most logistics.
Churches can help support celibate people in creating these intentional Christian communities by suggesting the idea, helping them cast vision for it, providing pastoral support while they explore the possibility, coaching them through the process, and maybe even providing financial support in the early years.

Ex) For example, some of us in Nashville have started the Nashville Family of Brothers Monastery with the goal of offering family to celibate men in Nashville for God’s glory. After at least 5 years of discernment, men make final promises to the Nashville Family of Brothers. There’s at least 10 men currently at different stages of discernment, and we’ve already started living together and practicing family rhythms of prayer, confession, meals, vacations, and holidays. The pastor at my church has been instrumental in suggesting the idea, supporting us through the process, providing wisdom, and leading a public ceremony where we made first commitments.

This is the kind of solution the Church needs

Regardless of which path they take, celibate people need intimate, committed, and permanent family just like everyone else
You’ve noticed that each solution involves living together and commitment
We need to help celibate people find that
Because it is particularly hard for celibate people to find that
And the paths are often unconventional



MARRIAGE


[Notes]
Now I want to talk about 5 practical steps your church can take to support mixed-orientation marriages



Thriving in Marriage



What is a MOM?
Mixed-orientation marriages (MOMs) are opposite-sex marriages where at least one spouse experiences same-sex attraction.

[Notes]
What is a MOM?  Mixed-orientation marriages are opposite-sex marriages where at least one spouse experiences same-sex attraction.

Many people have very strong opinions about MOMs, and for good reason. Many of us have seen the implosion of a MOM that ended in a divorce and hurt everyone involved. 
For decades, pastors and parents told gay people to marry someone of the opposite sex and keep their desires a secret, hoping it would cure their gayness. But that secrecy was the seed of destruction. 

In response to all of the bad fruit resulting from pushing MOMs, the pendulum has swung to the other extreme. From the late 2000s to now, many pastors have encouraged all gay people to remain celibate. They’ve discouraged any gay person from considering a MOM, claiming that they never work and are always unfair to the straight spouse.







Teach it – accurately, to prevent harm
Model it – thriving MOMs that share
Celebrate it – show that it is valued
Discern it – listen and accept the call
Support it – normalize them
Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
Neither of these extremes are helpful. So how can churches teach carefully about MOMs and support them well?
Churches must
Teach it
Model it 
Celebrate it
Discern it
And Support it






Teach it – 
Teach about the possibility of mixed-orientation marriage carefully so that we prevent the harm that has been so common for decades
Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
First, we’ve got to teach about it. We need to teach about the possibility of mixed-orientation marriage carefully so that we prevent the harm that has been so common for decades.







Teach it – 
Don’t pressure either way
Teach accurately about marriage
Don’t discredit MOMs
Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
First, don’t pressure folks either way.  Celibacy is a vocation equally available to everyone.  MOMs won’t work for everyone, but God does and will call some gay people to marry someone of the opposite sex.
Second, teach accurately about what marriage is and what it isn’t.
If marriage is primarily about sexual attraction and companionship, then perhaps MOMs won’t work.
But if it’s about emotional intimacy and vulnerability, commitment, raising children together, and displaying the gospel, then they can thrive.
Third, don’t discredit MOMs.  We typically only hear about the ones that fail, but there are gay people living in beautiful opposite-sex marriages that display the gospel, raising children, and serving in our churches.






Teach it – 
Talk about it before engagement
Continue to talk about it in marriage
Talk about it with other couples
Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
When we talk about MOMs as a possibility, we also need to teach carefully about how to do them well. There are ways to steward a MOM well if two people are called to such a marriage.

First, talk about it before engagement.  Recognize that same-sex attraction will likely always be present for the gay person.  You cannot promise someone else that your SSA won’t return. You must give the other person this information when deciding whether to continue the relationship.
Second, continue to talk about it in marriage.  As with any marriage, communication lines must remain open between spouses. Spouses need to steward this part of their marriage together.
Third, talk about it with other couples, both MOMs and straight.  Couples in MOMs need other couples in MOMs to talk to – those who “get it” without having to explain everything.  But they also need straight couples to talk to. It’s easy for a couple in a MOM that doesn’t talk with other couples to blame their marital issues on the sexuality of the gay spouse. But if couples in a MOM share about their challenges with straight couples, they quickly realize that their marital issues are universal challenge that all marriages have to deal with, but they have to share with straight couples to know this!
Also, a quick note about sexual intimacy in MOMs. I don’t personally know any MOMs that fail to enjoy physical and sexual intimacy with each other. Does the gay person experience the same carnal, fleshly urges as their straight peers? Maybe not. But secular sex therapists say that the recipe for marital and sexual satisfaction isn’t sexual attraction; it’s emotional intimacy + vulnerability + commitment.  These professionals recognize that sexual attraction isn’t necessary for any couple to have a healthy, long-term relationship. When a MOM ends in divorce, it’s almost never because of complaints about the couple’s sex life.






Model it – 
Kids and teens need to see couples in MOMs and see them thriving in their marriages
Give MOMs opportunities to share honestly about their marriages
Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
The second way churches can cultivate thriving in mixed-orientation marriages is to model it. Teens need to see couples in MOMs and see them thriving in their marriages. We need to give MOMs opportunities to share honestly about the beauty and brokenness of their marriages.
If kids and teens don’t see MOMs (thriving MOMs), they’ll be far less likely to believe that a MOM is possible or that God could call them to be in one 

Encourage those in MOMs to share with pastors and/or their small group.  Most of those who are in MOMs want to be “out.” Couples in MOMs need to know that their churches are safe places to share the beauty and brokenness of their marriage, and that they’ll be encouraged and supported in their relationship.










Celebrate it– 
Acknowledge the beauty that MOMs offer in grace, sacrifice, faithfulness, and hope in the gospel
Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
Third, churches can cultivate thriving in MOMs by celebrating them.
There are many ways to celebrate a marriage - engagement parties, weddings, anniversaries, couples’ retreats, even Valentine banquets in church fellowship halls.  But do we shy away from mentioning that a couple is in a MOM when celebrating their marriage? Or do we embrace that reality, noting that it’s hard but also a beautiful picture of grace, sacrifice, faithfulness, and hope in the gospel?  Celebrate MOMs. They are beautiful pictures of Christ’s love for His bride.







Discern it– 
Help gay people discern whether they are called to vocational singleness or a MOM.
Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
Fourth, our churches need to help gay people discern whether they are called to vocational singleness or a MOM.







Discern it– 
Celibacy and Christian marriage are beautiful options available to all
Ask God what His preference is
Celibacy must actually be a viable choice and taught well
Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
From a young age, we need to teach that both Christian marriage and vocational singleness are beautiful options and that both are available to all Christians, including gay people. When teens and young adults have a healthy understanding of God’s intentions for Christian marriage and vocational singleness, they are more likely to discern carefully. Just like their straight peers, gay teens need to hear that God has a preference for their life, and He desires for us to ask Him whether He is calling us to Christian marriage or vocational singleness.
A key lever for gay teens to choose a MOM for the right reasons is that vocational singleness must actually be a viable choice. Right theology and viable practice of vocational singleness will lead to healthier motivations for entering into MOMs. If vocational singleness isn’t an option, marriage isn’t either – it becomes a forced choice.  Both MUST be done well for each to be viable.

Among the MOMs that I know that have ended, most of the time the gay person got into the marriage because they believed it was there only option. So they never really chose the burden and the beauty of marriage. Unsurprisingly, this did not end well.







Support it– 
Cultivate thriving in MOMs by supporting them well
Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
Last but not least, we can cultivate thriving in MOMs by supporting them well. 







Support it– 
Teach correct theology of marriage and vocational singleness
Model MOMs
Celebrate MOMs
Help teens discern their vocation


Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
Supporting MOMs well looks a lot like what we’ve already heard: becoming churches where a correct theology of marriage and vocational singleness is taught, where MOMs are modeled and it’s safe for couples to reveal that they’re in a MOM, where MOMs are celebrated, and where teens and young adults are taught how to discern God’s direction for them.







Support it– 
Encourage deep friendships
Eradicate the idolization of sex and marriage
Provide therapy and expertise when needed


Thriving in Marriage

[Notes]
Practically, churches can further support MOMs in these ways:
-Encourage deep friendships.  Every person, married or not, gay or not, needs close friends of the same sex.  When your spouse is your only close friend, co-dependency can develop and the marriage turns inward and sometimes implodes.  Leadership should model having deep friendships outside of their spouse.

-Eradicate the idolization of romance and sex in your churches.  When sex is idolized and expected to be a central part of marriage, couples in MOMs can feel like their marriage isn’t “normal” - if the husband is gay, he may desire sex with his wife less often than his straight peers.  This can make the husband feel less manly because he doesn’t want sex all the time, and it can make the wife feel less desired.

-Provide therapy and expertise when needed.  If your church has an in-house counselor, make sure they have competency in serving MOMs and people who are LGBT.  If not, familiarize yourself with some counselors and therapists who do have proper expertise.
So talk about MOMs.  Normalize them. Support them. Recognize that they exist and that they’ll be beautiful for some.
