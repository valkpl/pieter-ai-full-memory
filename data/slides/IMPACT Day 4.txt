[Notes]
With the foundation this training provided and after further personal exploration of this topic using the suggested resources or in partnership with EQUIP, you can apply this learning in your church and home in meaningful ways. We can start by asking the following questions:




Who are the stakeholders?
Pastors
Lay Leaders
Parents
Celibate Adults
Youth

Application Questions
3

[Notes]
Rushing into conversation in your community about this topic will likely result in one of many groups within your group reacting negatively. This can be avoided by reaching out to different groups of people within your community and sharing the process of explore whether there is a need and designing a solution that fits the DNA of your church. Stakeholders may include pastors, lay leaders, parents, celibate adults, and youth.

Is there clarity of belief?
Clarifying your church’s beliefs takes courage and provides direction for action

Application Questions

[Notes]
Next steps often halt when a community realizes they do not know clearly what they believe and, therefore, do not know how to go forward. Clarifying your church’s beliefs on this topic takes courage but it is worthwhile, providing direction for action.



Reflect & Plan



Do you know what your church believes? Is there clarity of belief within your community?

[Notes]
What is the content?
What is the conversation that you hope to have? Perhaps the best place to start is with your goal and then work backward: Do you hope for people to grow in their familiarity with and empathy for LGBT+ people? Do you hope for people to better appreciate God's posture toward marginalized people? Do you hope to explore a complex and compassionate theology of intimacy and sexuality? Do you hope to deepen your awareness of the need for spiritual friendship in the Church? Do you want to learn how to be a better friend to those who experience same-sex attraction? Combine your answers to the previous questions with your vision for the content to sketch out your first steps. Check out the content suggestions on the next page.
