OBJECTIONS


[Notes]
shift gears here for a second and address the most convincing argument for a progressive sexual ethic

Even if we know why we believe what we believe, others’ arguments can be confusing to respond to




Best Side A Objections



Jesus never condemned homosexuality…
The clobber passages are uncertain and unnecessary
The Bible (including Jesus) and the Church have spoken with clarity about what Christian marriage is

[Notes]
jesus never said anything about homosexuality
the Bible isn’t clear on this so should leave this to people and their God
all within context of incest, rape, sex outside of marriage, adultery

yes, the clobber verses alone leave room for uncertainty
Biblical acrobatics
but they aren’t necessary
what is overwhelmingly convincing is what the Bible has to say marriage IS
Jesus named marriage as between a man and a woman
as we shared earlier, the Bible and the Church have spoken with clarity that Christian marriage is a lifetime vocation between a man and a woman to enjoy intimacy and raise children






The Bible doesn’t address gay people or SSM as we think of them today
There have always been gay people
Gay as an identity is created, just like race
God has consistently been against same-sex romantic and sexual activity
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
homosexual orientation/identity didn't exist in Bible times, therefore the Bible wasn’t talked about gay people or same-sex marriage as we think of it today

Let’s be clear, there have always been people who experience same-sex attraction—there have always been gay people
Beyond that, being gay being a different cultural group or a distinct sexuality is something created by man—just like race—to oppress people
But the reason people in Ancient Times never considered the idea of same-sex marriage was because there was an assumption that a primary purpose of marriage was procreation
And while God has never been against gay people—he is against same-sex sexual and romantic activity, and that is consistent throughout time






The Bible is wrong on slavery and sexism, so it’s wrong on homosexuality too
The Bible shows a trajectory on racial and gender equality that reflects an accommodating God
The Bible consistently condemns same-sex sexual activity for all people throughout time

Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
Many argue that the Bible and Christians were wrong about racial and gender equality, and in the same way the Bible and Christians are wrong about homosexuality

But if we take a closer look at how the Bible talks about these three things across the Biblical narrative, we will see something different
God is an accommodating God—instead of calling people to perfection he sometimes calls them to something more good that is in reach or within the bounds of their understanding
The people and place and time that the authors of the Bible spoke into could not have accepted modern ways Christians think about racial and gender equality
But we do see the way God talks about these things in the Bible change over time—they suggest a trajectory toward the ultimate good
Ultimately, the Bible points toward what we believe about racial and gender equality today
However, that same trajectory is not found in how the Bible talks about same-sex sexual activity
It consistently condemns it
God doesn’t seem to be accommodating here, there isn’t a trajectory toward a different, better good
It is a flat line pointing toward the same conclusion throughout time for all people






Celibacy is a choice and works for few
Neither celibacy nor marriage are chosen—they are called, they are given
They are both difficult and rewarding vocations when stewarded faithfully
The Church can better support celibacy
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
no one should be forced into celibacy, and celibacy doesn’t work for everyone

Neither celibacy nor marriage are chosen—they are called, they are given
And just because someone is called to something doesn’t mean it will be easy
Celibacy and marriage are both difficult and rewarding vocations when stewarded faithfully







MOMs are destructive (more later)
MOMs fail because people hide their SSA and couples don’t talk about it
MOMs I know that do this well are thriving more than the average Christian family
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
MOMs are a bad idea

We will talk more about this later, but MOMs fail because the person hides their same-sex attractions or the couple doesn’t share with others
MOMs I know that do this well are thriving more than the average Christian family






Traditional sexual ethics bears bad fruit
Wrong theology or bad application?
The Church isn’t a place where LGBT+ people can thrive in celibacy or a MOM
Plenty of bad fruit of engaging in same-sex sexual and romantic relationships
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
we see the bad fruit of a traditional theology

There is definitely bad fruit (gay teen suicide and hate crime)
The question remains: it is bad fruit of bad theology or bad fruit of bad application?
My hunch is that it is bad fruit of bad application, but the Christians cannot judge people for failing to take hold of something we aren’t offering
It’s on us to become churches where people can thrive in celibacy and MOMs
But if we continue to fail to, we have no one to blame but ourselves
I would also note that there is plenty of bad fruit of engaging in same-sex sexual and romantic relationships and culturally typical expression






Same-sex attraction doesn’t change
Counseling for unwanted SSA is no less effective and no more harmful than the next therapy
Attractions are fluid, but the goal isn’t to make people straight
God calls us to honor Him with our sexual stewardship and thrive
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
reparative therapy doesn’t work and people’s same-sex attraction doesn’t change
psychological community says it isn’t an illness

A lot of misinformation about providing counseling to Christians who identify their same-sex attraction as unwanted
No less effective and no more harmful than the next therapy
While attractions are fluid and most people I know experienced at least a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of their SSA once they started doing some work around their stuff, the goal isn’t to make people straight
The goal is to help people steward their sexualities in God-honoring ways and thrive






God makes people gay (more later)
Genetic + environmental factors contribute to the development of SSA
All of us were corrupted at a genetic level and born into a broken world that further injured us
We do not choose our attractions, and God appreciates the challenges

Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
we know now that same-sex attraction isn’t a choice and significant genetic contributions
God makes people this way so he must be okay with it

We will talk more about this in the next session
But the consensus among scientists is that both genetic factors and environmental factors contribute to the development of SSA
But even if people were born gay, it doesn’t mean God intended people to be gay
None of us are how God imagined us to be—all of us were corrupted at a genetic level and born into a broken world that further injured us
God doesn’t not intend for anyone to experience same-sex attraction or to engage in same-sex romantic or sexual relationships
But we also do not choose who we are attracted to
Our God appreciates the challenges those who experience same-sex attraction face in stewarding their sexualities






A loving God wouldn’t deprive us of love
What does it mean to be loving? Willing someone to enjoy the best things God has to offer
Christian orthodoxy informs what those best things are
Love = Orthodoxy + Empathy (helping others told hold of the best things)
Best Side A Objections

[Notes]
God is love
love = willing someone to enjoy the best things life has to offer
the best things come from God, so loving someone is willing them to enjoy what God offers
how do we know what those best things are? Christian orthodoxy
but it’s not enough to just point people toward the best things
we have to help people take hold of them
we have to empathize with their experience and be willing to sacrifice to help them thrive
love = empathy + orthodoxy
hate without orthodoxy isn’t love
empathy without orthodoxy isn’t love
orthodoxy without empathy isn’t love
If we want to imitate God and love people, we will invite them to take hold of the best things according to Christian orthodoxy and help them do so
