terms,passages, & questions

[Notes]
before we jump into exploring the Belonging Team’s recommendations,
I’d like to share with you what terms and definitions the Belonging Team has been using
what passages of Scripture we’re considered
and what the key theological questions seem to be

Concepts/Terminology
Biological sex—physical body; being male or female as defined by chromosomes, gonads, sexual anatomy, and secondary sex characteristics

Gender—internal sense of being a woman or a man; influenced by cultural gender roles/expectations; named/labeled internally and externally as gender identity

Concepts/Terminology
Femininity/Masculinity – a person’s sense of being a woman/man and cultural expectations for how women/men will express their gender

Gender Incongruence – An acute sense that one's gender does not correspond with the experience typically associated with the person's biological sex

Transgender/Trans – A general term for someone who experiences gender incongruence

Concepts/Terminology
Social transition – non-medical steps, names/pronouns, adjustments to clothing/hairstyle, using alt bathrooms

Hormonal transition - use of hormone blockers and/or Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) that chemically alters a person’s secondary sex

Surgical transition – adding/removing breasts, altering genitalia, vocal cord surgeries, etc.

[Notes]
Various steps of gender transition can be organized into three ranges: social transition, hormonal transition, and surgical transition.

Social transitioning involves taking steps within one’s social circles to mitigate incongruence non-medically.These include name and/or pronoun changes, adjustments to one’s appearance through clothing and hairstyle changes,wrapping/taping to flatten the chest, packing to give the appearance of having a bulge, using single stall bathrooms, using the bathroom of people of the opposite sex, and voice training to raise or lower the pitch of one’s voice. 

Hormonal transitioning involves the use of hormone blockers and/or Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)that chemically alters a person’s secondary sex characteristics to align with their gender identity. 
Surgical transitioning can include adding or removing breasts, various forms of plastic surgery to change facial features or enhance other parts of the body, vocal cord surgeries, and altering genitalia. The most common terms associated with surgical transitioning is “top” (think top half of the body) and “bottom” (refers exclusively to genital alterations) surgery.

Belonging Team Suggestions
When God first imagined each of us being born into a perfect world, He intended for each of us to be either a male who feels fully like a man or a female who feels fully like a woman—either male-bodied men or female-bodied women who experience congruence in their bodies. (Genesis 1-3). 

The Bible affirms the sex and gender binary. Faithfulness to our biological sex includes accepting our sex and following God’s wisdom when we engage our capacity for relationship. 

Belonging Team Suggestions
Everything about this world is broken, including each of our biological sexes and each of our genders. Cultural concepts of gender, including arbitrarily assigning preference to one gender or another, are broken.

God didn’t provide any further universal prescriptions for maleness/femaleness or masculinity/femininity. He left the rest (cultural norms for gender and gender expression) to us.

Belonging Team Suggestions
There is a biblical pattern of condemning genital alteration (Deuteronomy 22:5 and Deuteronomy 23:1), cross-dressing as part of cult practices (1 Corinthians 11:2-16), and the elimination of gender difference (1 Corinthians 11:2-16). 

Belonging Team Suggestions
The Bible makes clear that genital alteration does not prevent people from being able to image God and be part of His family (Isaiah 56:1-5, Acts 8:25-39). The Bible affirms dozens of times when men and women in the Bible break what we would consider to be contemporary gender stereotypes (Psalm 51:10-11, Micah 6:8, I Samuel 18:1-3, Proverbs 31, Judges 4:4, Acts 16:14, Luke 7:47,50). The authors of Scripture were aware of trans people.

Belonging Team Suggestions
Gender incongruence develops from a combination of nature and nurture, but specifics are unknown. God didn’t intend gender incongruence. No one chose to experience enduring, robust gender incongruence. Gender incongruence is a brokenness. Merely experiencing gender incongruence is not a sin. 

Belonging Team Suggestions
When a person is not intersex but they experience gender incongruence, we believe that their biological sex is as God intended but their gender experience is broken.

While some estimates find that 80% of people experience relief from gender incongruence over time, there’s no formula for “healing” gender incongruence.

Belonging Team Suggestions
Hormonal/surgical transition has not been scientifically demonstrated to reliably reduce depression/suicidality. There is no evidence to clearly support the theory that there is a brain-sex/body-sex difference that leads to gender incongruence.

Taking steps to alter one’s sex and reject God’s gift of their sex (hormonal or surgical transition) are sins. Social transition steps could be taken in a morally neutral way depending on one’s motivations/intent.

[Notes]
if you chose to adopt a theological framework similar to the Belonging Team’s recommendations
here’s what it might look like to put those convictions into action
in particular, what it would look like to minister to a Christians who is experiencing gender incongruence

Pastoral Care Implications
1. Resist ”transition or suicide!” & “just be normal!”
Instead, believe trans people when they share about their experience
Honor the cost of faithful stewardship and the Church’s responsibility
Commit to walking with them, helping them discern, and reminding them of Christ’s love for them and faithfulness to them

[Notes]
First, adopt a general posture of empathy and compassion

Different extremes in the debate about gender incongruence offer trans people equally unhelpful advice:
One side yells, “Just be normal!”
They ignore the reality that trans* people did not choose to experience gender incongruence
and that there is no proven combination of counseling or spiritual practices to eliminate gender incongruence.
Those on this extreme minimize the daily, painful reality of navigating enduring gender incongruence.
They seem to forget that trans* people are also made in the image of God, are greatly valued by Him, 
and that Christians should greatly value trans* people as well.
Then the other side yells, “Transition or suicide!”
They suggest that transition is an effective intervention to address mental illness (including suicidality) 
and that those who hesitate to bless hormonal and surgical transition are increasing suicidality.

resist both of those extremes

Instead, believe trans* people when they share about their experience. 
Honor that faithfully stewarding gender incongruence will be costly and demands the support of trans* people’s siblings in Christ.
Remind trans* Christians that Jesus cares for them and is with them in the pain and mess of life. 
While it is painfully difficult to live in a world (and a body) burdened by brokenness, 
brokenness will not be our experience forever; we have a hope and a future in Jesus for resurrected bodies and life when all will be made right.
Finally, take your time to build rapport with trans* Christians you’re ministering to. 
Patiently invest in relationships to earn their trust.
And don’t be surprised when walking together is at times difficult and complicated. 

Pastoral Care Implications
Prioritize addressing any mental health challenges with proven interventions to reduce depression/suicidality
Honor their lack of choice and explore morally neutral relief
Support their acceptance of some enduring brokenness and hardship

[Notes]
Second, prioritize addressing mental health challenges

Before jumping into heavy theological questions or difficult discernment about transition, help them gather the resources they need to care for any co-occurring mental health conditions they’re experiencing.
And focus on addressing those before anything else

The following interventions have be scientifically proven to most effectively reduce depression and suicidality:
Talk therapy with a counselor to address grief/loss
Regular exercise/physical activity
Anti-depressants
A broader community of social support

Third, honor their lack of choice and explore morally neutral relief
Trans* people don’t choose to experience gender incongruence, 
but they do have the responsibility to faithfully steward their brokenness. 

Support trans* Christians as they consider morally neutral options in the range of social transition 
that might provide relief from the gender incongruence. 
Help them weigh each possibility and carefully step forward where the Lord leads. 
Help them resolve what they can and manage what they must.

Fourth, support their acceptance of some enduring brokenness and hardship

Even if a trans Christian you’re supporting takes some morally neutral steps to reduce their distress, 
they’ll likely continue to experience some level of persisting and painful gender incongruence.
And while hormonal and surgical transition have not been shown to effectively reduce suicidality, 
trans Christians yearning for further relief will certainly be burdened by cultural messages that further transition will eliminate their distress.

Step into that space and encourage trans* Christians you’re ministering to 
to resist further transition that is unlikely to provide the relief they desire, 
and instead invite them to accept some level of enduring brokenness.
Unfortunately, all believers, in one way or another, will continue to experience
some physical or emotional or spiritual brokenness for the rest of their life. 
Part of being a Christian on this side of Christ’s return is learning to live with some level of brokenness. 
That’s why we yearn so much for Jesus to return and make everything right, 
including giving us perfect resurrection minds, bodies, and souls!
Help trans* Christians you’re ministering to explore what Christians throughout the ages have written about suffering 
and how they found a way to accept persisting brokenness. 
And then hold space for them as they grieve this acceptance.
Some pain will be unavoidable.
Trans* people can’t avoid using a name for themselves, using pronouns, 
going to the bathroom, wearing clothes, or speaking with a pitched voice. 
There will be daily, unavoidable, and painful reminders for trans* people of their gender incongruence.
Make space for them to be angry, sad, afraid, and numb. 
Reassure them that their feelings are valid and that their pain is real. 
Promise them that you won’t leave their side, and then stay.

Pastoral Care Implications
Give permission to reject cultural gender stereotypes 
Encourage Christians navigating gender incongruence to share their stories with siblings in Christ and gather with other trans Christians

[Notes]
fifth, give permission to reject cultural gender stereotypes

American culture has arbitrarily attributed preferences and affinities to gender that have nothing inherently to do with gender.While the core of a trans* Christian’s distress is an internal sense that their biological sex and felt gender are incongruent,
feeling forced to comply with arbitrary cultural expectations can multiply distress.
Help trans* Christians reduce pain related to their gender by giving them permission to reject cultural gender stereotypes.

Parents and pastors can join trans* Christians by resisting over-prescription of what universal, Biblical masculinity and femininity are,
while maintaining a God-ordained distinction between the biological sexes and genders.
Giving trans* Christians (and any Christian) permission to express themselves in culturally atypical ways
may raise questions or concerns with siblings in Christ who are less aware of the arbitrary nature of gender stereotypes.

Pastors and parents can protect trans* Christians from harassment for their preferences and affinities
by engaging with concerned believers, 
assuring them that rejection of cultural gender does not mean rejection of God’s gift of one’s biological sex or gender.

Sixth, encourage Christians navigating gender incongruence to share their stories with siblings in Christ
and gather with other trans* Christians.
Trans* Christians need to share about their experiences to be fully known and fully loved. 
They need to share their stories, and they need to see their siblings in Christ respond with curiosity and compassion. 
At the same time, our churches need to hear the stories of trans* Christians who are faithfully stewarding their brokenness.
Cisgender Christians can learn from the courage and resiliency of trans* Christians, 
and cisgender Christians can gain self-awareness about the ways cultural gender stereotypes haunt them by empathizing with trans* Christians.
Pastors and parents also need to encourage trans* Christians to gather with other trans* Christians. 
Among those with shared experiences, Christians navigating gender incongruence will find unique support and understanding. 
Each of these opportunities for Christian fellowship can contribute to greater spiritual growth, 
discovering shared meaning in suffering, and enjoying healthy intimacy in a community of believers.

Pastoral Care Implications
Practice name/pronoun hospitality with non-Christians & in first interactions with someone
support mature trans Christians in 		God-honoring discernment
defer to the authority of parents

[Notes]
7. Given names and biological pronouns can be a constant reminder of the pain and tension that is felt every day.

Identifying as trans or using alt pronouns can mean as little as “I experience gender incongruence”
or as much as “I am fundamentally a trans person and must follow a trans cultural script to be true to self” (and everything in between).

In early conversation, particularly if the person is not a Christian, practice language mirroring as hospitality.

Listen to the identifiers, names, and pronouns that the individual uses, and then use those same words as an act of hospitality.

You might ask the individual what they mean when they use those words.
Choosing to mirror those words with those meanings in early conversation is not affirmation that the individual is using the best words and meanings,
but instead an act of hospitality to avoid tension over language.

This is a simple but effective way to diffuse potential tension early in the relationship and open the door for future conversation.

For those using the word trans or alt pronouns or names to communicate that they are a fundamentally different kind of person and to signal a rejection of God’s gift of their biological sex,
you might have a different kind of conversation.

If the person is someone you’ve had years of relationship with
And you demonstrated your care for them
And they’ve invited you to disciple them through some of this stuff
Then you might push on them about the wisdom of them using those words.

Again, not because of the words themselves,
but because of the intentions behind the words.

You might ultimately choose to continue to respect their pronoun and name request, but you also will have registered with them your perspective that those preferences might not be wisest

When it comes to minors,I default to respecting the preferences of parents, particularly if they’re kids or younger teens.
Ultimately, discipleship is parents’ responsibility, and I’ll respect that.
If parents want me to honor a kid’s pronoun/name requests, then I’ll do that.
If parents want me to ignore a kid’s pronoun/name requests, then I’ll do that. 

If older teens are driving themselves to activities, consider respecting their request, unless you hear otherwise from parents

Pastoral Care Implications
Make single-occupancy restrooms accessible
Help trans teens navigate overnight trips while honoring other teens and families

[Notes]
8. Most trans people prefer to use single-occupancy bathrooms–
If you don’t have a single-occupancy bathroom at your church, consider installing one or converting a current small bathroom.

To avoid controversy, you can label it as a “family” bathroom and privately communicate to trans people that it’s an all-gender single-occupancy bathroom available to them.
Many trans people will avoid using the bathroom at church if no single-occupancy bathrooms are available.

9. Teen camp sleeping arrangements: 
Most trans people don't want to sleep in a space with people of the opposite sex (or the same sex). 
More often than not, trans teens prefer privacy away from people of the same or opposite sex. 
Be creative and be prepared to inform other students/parents.
