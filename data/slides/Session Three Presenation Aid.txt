but that’s only stage one

it’s okay if you don’t feel like you’ve mastered the content
enhance learning by teach HC Leaders and Grow Class
transform church culture
direct support in support group
EQUIP Nashville
Is Homosexuality 
Wrong?


[Notes]
Whether we want to have this conversation or not, we sometimes have to

Particularly for someone who has arrived at a gay-affirming theology, this may be a necessary step one
Discussion
EQUIP Nashville
How would you go about                this conversation?

Where do you start?

What has been successful about your conversations in the past?
8
Is Homosexuality Wrong?
EQUIP Nashville
A few considerations, not prescriptions

We know little with absolute certainty

Start with Scripture, but don’t stop there


[Notes]
Is there absolute truth? Yes! 
Can we know it with absolute certainty in a way that we can prove to others? Rarely
some people don’t’ find spot-checking the bible for verses about homosexuality convincing, but there’s more
Is Homosexuality Wrong?
EQUIP Nashville
The Uniqueness of Christian Marriage

One man and one woman before God
Reflection of intimacy and complementarity in trinity
Centrality of procreation
Responsibility and commitment
Is Homosexuality Wrong?
EQUIP Nashville
Homosexuality is Unnatural

No examples in nature
Anal sex unnatural
Physical and mental health risks


[Notes]
Note: I think this is an important point, but there will be many contexts where this will not be appropriate

Asserting dominance and ambiguous sex, but no analog to Modern Family

anal bleeding
Excretion
lose control of bowel movements

Risk: colon cancer
Prevalence: HIV infection
alcohol and substance abuse
Suicide

I don’t assert these to argue that homosexuality necessarily causes these things
oppression and discrimination are often causes
which leads us to a broader question

Is Homosexuality Wrong?
EQUIP Nashville
What makes a sin sinful?

Arbitrary lines? No
Fun things? No
That which will hurt us
Is Homosexuality Wrong?
EQUIP Nashville
Who should I love? How? 
What will make me happiest?

Created for perfect intimacy with Him and His family
We all have intimacy needs
Marriage nor sex necessary
16
EQUIP Nashville
Future Outlook
Future Outlook
EQUIP Nashville
What can a person who experiences SSA expect in the future?

No guarantee of reduced SSA or increased OSA
Marriage prospects same as anyone else: for some, not for others



[Notes]
soapbox: marriage different but not better
Future Outlook
EQUIP Nashville
God promises (1) transformation of heart and mind and (2) provision of joy and peace

obsess over eliminating SSA
seek understanding of SSA
manage temptation
intimacy with God and His family and working to heal/redeem the world
19
EQUIP Nashville
Assumptions

What NOT to Say


[Notes]
False Promises
Behavioral Fixes
Conversation Killers
What NOT to Say
EQUIP Nashville
False Promises

God has marriage for everyone
If you don’t get this right, you will go to Hell
God can do all things, so He will completely heal this in your lifetime
What NOT to Say
EQUIP Nashville
Behavioral Fixes

Just pray, read your Bible, and go to church more—God will take it away
You can choose anything—you weren’t forced to feel these things, so just stop
You’re still struggling because you’re not doing it right
What NOT to Say
EQUIP Nashville
Conversation Killers

You don’t need to think about this psychological/heady stuff
The Bible is clear that it’s wrong—why are you doubting even for a moment?
The Church has loved people well around this, you are just being needy
27
Discussion
EQUIP Nashville
What are some more subtle or indirect ways you have heard these sentiments shared?

What are some other phrases you would add to the list?

He has had sex with most of the women his age at work. He needs it, but it never seems to be satisfying. He comes to you looking for advice. He knows it is wrong, but he doesn’t know how to stop.

He is pretty passive, he isn’t good at sports, he can’t grow facial hair, and he has a higher-pitched voice. He talks about how his dad was a man’s man but they were never close and that in middle school and high school, he never felt like one of the guys.
