[Notes]
BELONG – LGBT+ people can find acceptance and unconditional love, talk about their experiences without shame, find meaningful, intimate community
BELIEVE – offer complex and winsome theology of sexuality, walk alongside people as they come to believe what is true

POSTURE





Choose to be sensitive to the stories and experiences of LGBT+ people
Don’t tokenize
Appreciate their unique experiences
Practice term mirroring

Posture

Become

[Notes]
Share with you what this has looked like for me
What has meant the most to me has been when a friend has listened to my story, asked questions, and sought out additional resources to learn more
He can imagine how I am feeling and anticipates when I need support
He is sensitive to things that would hurt me and situations where I would feel alone
But he also knows that he only understands my experience in part and will always be a learner





Demonstrate safety and empathy
Invite to share, and listen
Trust the Holy Spirit


Posture

Become




Avoid forced-choice moments
Invite to submit to traditional sexual ethic
Patiently explore God’s call to sexual stewardship

Posture

Become

[Notes]
Right now, our churches aren’t offering something better, so if you push them into a corner and make them choose, they will not choose Jesus
This has been difficult with my own side A gay Christians friends—their depression and suicidality
That patience is key—it may take decades or longer of walking through these ideas for the Holy Spirit to move the person where he/she needs to be




Share
Many find it difficult to maintain an environment of sensitivity, safety, empathy, and patience because of messages like, “If I do not condemn, I am condoning.”
Where does that come from?
Are you comfortable resisting condemnation and trusting the Holy Spirit?

MINISTER


[Notes]
I assume that you have basic pastoral care skills
This training is meant to supplement that with SSA-specific ideas and skills
We don’t expect every pastor, lay leader, and parent in your church to be able to effectively minister
Different people will have different depth of expertise

11 questions
creating space for questions, helping think well, and listening well 
don’t expect you to answer questions for them



Ministering: Core Q’s



Will you treat me differently now that you know?
Honesty
Honor courage in sharing

[Notes]
Terrifying when I first shared my story



Ministering: Core Q’s



How does same-sex attraction develop?
None of us are how God made us to be
Neither born gay nor chose to be gay

Become

[Notes]
For many, this gets down to the classic question: “are people born gay or do they choose to be gay”
Well I want to make clear right from the start, I never chose to be gay, and you never chose to be straight
Now to the second question: are people born gay
Twins and hormone studies inconclusive, suggestion predisposition
Not genetically determined
But even if it was
None of us are how God made us to be
corrupted at genetic level and raised in broken world
So my answer: neither born gay nor choose to be gay




Ministering: Core Q’s



How does same-sex attraction develop?
Equifinality: multiple pathways to the same outcome 
Multifinality: group of people with same factors have different outcomes 

Become

[Notes]
List factors briefly: can go into more depth in a workshop dedicated to this
Predisposing factors - genetic predisposition, physical composition, emotional disposition  
Precipitating factors - sexual abuse, unhealthy relationship with the same or opposite sex parent, broken view of gender
Perpetuating factors - sexualization, continued gender incongruence, psychological vulnerability, rejection and shame



Ministering: Core Q’s



How does same-sex attraction develop?
Understanding developmental factors may help an individual gain acceptance but should not be addressed with the goal of “fixing” the individual

Become

[Notes]
For me this was helpful because it wasn’t a mystery anymore.
My experience also breaks the duality—it doesn’t fit in the culture war




Ministering: Core Q’s



Will my same-sex attraction change?
There is no promise of change in attractions
Some will experience change and some will not, but not as a reflection of how hard we want it or work at it

Become

[Notes]
Is it wise for people to continue to pray for God to change them? I don’t

I have experienced a decrease in frequency and magnitude of my same-sex attractions
But still a daily challenge, I expect it always will be
I’ve moved on from asking God to change this, and that has been really healthy for me
False hope in my life was very destructive for a long time

Ministering: Core Q’s



What part did God play and why?
Does God make people gay?
Give people over to “a depraved mind”?
Allow people to develop same-sex attraction?
Play no part?

Become



Ministering: Core Q’s



What part did God play and why?
Did not intend for anyone to be gay or make anyone gay (James 1:13) 
We are all corrupted at a genetic level and grow up in a broken world (Psalm 51:5) 
God allowed it to happen        (Romans 5:12)

Become



Ministering: Core Q’s



What part did God play and why?
If God protected us from the consequences of our actions and the actions of others, would we really have choice?
God seeks to redeem all brokenness for our good and His glory (Romans 8:28) 

Become

[Notes]
Question of Evil
No good answer

I was really angry with God but suppressed that anger for a decade
Finally, I had a mentor who encouraged me to be honest
Jacob wrestling God—it is intimate
I had to express that anger before I could believe that God loves me—and honestly, I am still working through that




Ministering: Core Q’s



How does God see me?
He’s not surprised, and He sees you as valuable (Psalm 139)
We are all broken and accepted before a gracious and merciful God who will never abandon us

Become

[Notes]
You don’t have to become straight for God to love you



Ministering: Core Q’s



Where is God in all of this?
Be honest with God—He can take it (Genesis 32:22-32)
Frame within God’s universal intentions of intimacy and sexuality (Genesis 2)

Become

[Notes]
Being honest with God about my anger was intimate
Let what we know about God from Scripture and the Church guide our response

If our churches did this well, we wouldn’t be calling gay people to anything different or more difficult than straight people



Ministering: Core Q’s



Who am I in light of what I am feeling?
Honesty with self and others about thoughts/feelings
Distinguish between attractions, orientation, identity, and behavior
Radical acceptance: acknowledge and commit to work through

Become

[Notes]
Part of this is a conversation about identity
Can a Christian identify as gay?
I do, and here’s why:

I am a child of God, first and foremost
Jesus and Jesus alone sits on the throne of my life
And I experience same-sex attraction
That has significantly impacted my journey and how I see the world
It has connected me with others who have similar experiences
I feel connected with people in the past who have had similar experiences
And I think I have something to offer the Church particularly because of my experiences
For those reasons I identify as gay to identify with others with similar experiences
I don’t identify with sin or brokenness
It doesn’t describe who I am in any essential way
it is missiological: I use the language of teens and the culture so that I can better speak to them
And the term “same-sex attraction” is connected to the ex-gay movement and many theologically and psychologically problematic practices

In Heaven, will bind some but divide none

What do I do with all of this shame?
Satan’s primary weapon
Our response:
Identify, Reject, & Replace
Share
Ministering: Core Q’s

Become

[Notes]
When we tell people to hide their attractions
Not to talk about them
Don’t allow them to identify around them in any way
When we blame people for reaching out for forbidden things from their loneliness
We heap on the shame








 How do I refrain from behavior?
Pray for strength
Eliminate opportunities
Accountability
Ministering: Core Q’s

Become

[Notes]
Important distinction here about sexual addiction
Many gay Christians I know suffer from sexual addiction
Not because SSA is the result of sexual addiction itself
But because pornography, masturbation, and acting out with others was the solution we found to medicate the shame and loneliness we felt from being a Christian and experiencing same-sex attraction
This developed into an addiction that we will have to manage for the rest of our lives
But not all gay Christians struggle with sexual addiction
And there are plenty of straight Christians who struggle with sexual addiction

That’s all to say, if someone struggle with sexual addiction (gay or straight), accountability and managing temptation is going to look different and I encourage you to connect them with recovery programs specifically for sex addicts






 How do I meet my intimacy needs?
What are my needs?
Normalize
Jesus: angels in the wilderness and disciples in Gethsemane
Stewardship of meeting in healthy ways

Ministering: Core Q’s

Become

[Notes]
Universal

Encourage healthy relationships with others
if find themselves attracted to another, don’t shame 
discuss attractions and what exactly attracted to (may be related to shame or perceived inadequacy or may desire something healthy by sexualize) 
Encourage to identify safe friends






 How do I meet my intimacy needs?
Same-sex attractions are unmet needs for healthy intimacy that have been sexualized
Seek healthy relationships with safe friends

Ministering: Core Q’s

Become

[Notes]
discuss attractions and what exactly attracted to (may be related to shame or perceived inadequacy or may desire something healthy by sexualize)

My life got better when I stopped ignoring my loneliness and started meeting my needs in healthy ways with deep friendship
And to this day, if I am struggling with lust, instead of shaming myself, I want my first response to be asking myself whether I have been meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways (which I haven’t)







 What does the future look like?
A lifetime of sanctification and sexual stewardship
Intimacy with God and His family and working to redeem the world
Obedience to God’s teachings and surrendering our brokenness to God will bring goodness (Jeremiah 7:23)
Ministering: Core Q’s

Become






 What does the future look like?
God invites everyone to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Both are equally good and available to those who experience same-sex attraction
Ministering: Core Q’s

Become

[Notes]
A lot of my depression came from this feeling that my future would only contain continued suffering. As a child, I was led to believe that a wife and kids are what would make me most happy. And society tells me that if I only had a relationship with a guy I am attracted to, I would be most happy. But my attractions and beliefs make none of those an option
So you can see how it would be easy to despair
It wasn’t until I rejected those “promises” as false and learned what God really offers that I saw that my life can be just as beautiful as anyone else’s (if the Church does a better job of supporting celibates)

BECOME


[Notes]
2 big questions always come up around why LGBT+ people would even want to become whom Christ has called them to be



Application: BECOME
Why would an LGBT+ person ever want to go to a church that affirms a traditional sexual ethic?
We must offer something compelling: family in the Body of Christ and mission to redeem Creation




Become

[Notes]
Why would an LGBT+ person ever want to go to a church that affirms a traditional sexual ethic?
We can apply this question more generally: why would anyone want to be a part of a church that calls him or her to inconvenient stewardship of any kind?
Your church must offer something so compelling and beautiful that individuals will want to continue to be apart of your church despite other aspects they strongly disagree with.
We must invite them to be a part of a community of believers that is more satisfying than can be found anywhere else and invite them to come on mission with us to redeem the world.




Application: BECOME
What is the best way to love Side A gay Christians?
Trust the Holy Spirit
Walk alongside
Call straight Christians to submit their sexualities to God
Call the Church to support celibacy and mixed-orientation marriages




Become

[Notes]
What is the best way to love gay Christians who believe God blesses same-sex marriages?
As we noted in our training, we must have a posture of trusting and being patient with the Holy Spirit to reveal what is true to all of us according to His timing.
We can continue to nurture a meaningful relationship with the person and support that person in seeking greater goodness where he or she asks for help.
In the meantime, we can get busy helping our church offer something truly better!
To be frank, if your church isn’t offering anything better to LGBT+ people yet, why would that person ever want to steward his or her sexuality differently?
Start by calling straight Christians to meaningful, life-giving, and often inconvenient sexual stewardship and making your church a place where celibate Christians (gay or straight) can find meaningful community.
