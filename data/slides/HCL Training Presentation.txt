Welcome

Training Goal
To equip you to minister to those who experience same-sex attraction in your House Church


[Notes]
B: We want Ethos to be a place where those in the LGBT+ community feel welcome to worship, don’t have to hide who they are to pursue Christ alongside us, and invite into a mission and community that meets need for meaning and intimacy
 
To do that, we want to equip you to minister to those who experience same-sex attraction in your house church, we want to educate our church as a whole on how to be a friend to those who experience same-sex attraction, and we want to invite those in our congregation who experience same-sex attraction to share their story and recruit those in the Body of Christ around them to support them as they navigate their life. We know that those who experience same-sex attraction can find great spiritual growth, meaning in their challenges, identity in Christ, and intimacy in the Body of Christ by doing so.

Today, we are doing the first of those. But even then, today is not the end of your learning, and we invite your to continue conversation with each other and either of us.

[Notes]
B: what do we believe and why do we believe it
not talking about this because we think theological debate converts people in this day and age
but it’s difficult to love someone else well if you aren’t standing on solid ground
What Ethos Staff believe
We are primarily created for relationship with Jesus.
The fall has distorted, confused, and wounded us all deeply.
We are to be people led by the Spirit of GOD—not by our feelings or our flesh.
Physical, sexual relationships are reserved for a husband and wife in the context of marriage.
Those participating in homosexual activity should be treated with love and dignity.
Following Christ’s example, we will lovingly invite people to lay aside sin and embrace full life with him.

[Notes]
B:

Macro beliefs: instead of defaulting to how many do church: Behave, Believe, Belong; as a church, we want to follow the model of Belong, Believe, Become
we want to invite anyone and everyone to belong to the Ethos family, worship with us on Sunday, and to be a part of a House Church during the week
then, as people get to know Christ directly through scripture, worship, prayer, and communion and indirectly through brothers and sisters in Christ, they will incrementally believe
and finally, at each step that a person believes and makes Christ the Lord of that area of their life, they will become what Christ calls them to be and do what Christ calls them to do

(Bonus) Beliefs
Experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin
No promise of change in SSA
We do not choose who we are attracted to but we choose how we respond
Any sin can separate of from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all


[Notes]
P: as someone who experiences same-sex attraction and been forced to explore more of the nuances, I want to share a couple of additional ideas
Why we believe it
Preponderance of Biblical Support
Created for Intimacy
Uniqueness of Christian Marriage
Definition of Sin


36

[Notes]
P: but rooted in deeper, foundational truths
Created for intimacy
Spiritual, emotional, physical, social
good and human to have needs
neither marriage nor sex promised or necessary to meet intimacy needs
Singleness and marriage different but equal
all first called to singleness
some called out of singleness into marriage
Unique: reflection of complementarity and intimacy in the trinity; centrality of procreation
Sin: that which will hurt us

why are these foundational beliefs important? how do they inform how we think about homosexual activity?
shows that all called to steward sexuality in inconvenient ways
All can meet their intimacy needs in singleness
perhaps options seem slim for those who experience same-sex attraction because single people can’t meet their intimacy needs in the Church and Christians spread lie that marriage and sex promised and necessary

that leaves us with a challenge as a church to foster a community where people can meet their intimacy needs as single people and teach accurately about marriage

Discussion
What questions are you afraid to discuss in your House Church?
Do you feel comfortable leading a House Church with a diversity of beliefs?

[Notes]
P: Lead Team studied different perspectives on the development of same-sex attraction
goal for Lead Team wasn’t to settle the question of what causes same-sex attraction or give tools to dissect people, but instead to see constellation of deeper wounds underneath the same-sex attraction, many of which are common to all of us, so that we can see how similar we all are
share 5 factor model briefly (encourage to see these factors in own life)
encourage contacting individually for more thorough conversation

Biology: neither born gay nor choose it
None of us are how God made us to be

Perception of Genders: early relationships with parents inform how we see genders
do we see ourselves as same as, part of, belonging to, and good enough? do we see opposite as different, complementary, and having something to offer?
distorted view of who we are and where we do or do not fit can turn us off from opposite sex and unmet needs in same sex

Behavioral Learning: fundamental concepts in psychology is that much of who we are is learned
that previously unassociated ideas can become linked through rewards and punishments
neurons that fire together wire together
if we already don’t see ourselves as being like everyone else, perhaps find opposite sex less attractive, and world tells us we ought to be gay, can learn to like more

Sexual Abuse: shame and gender confusion
sexual abuse survivors from trauma often re-enact experiences

Psychological Issues: amplify or make more vulnerable

Take-away’s
SSA is not genetically determined
Perception of genders is important
Factors are universal

Activity

[Notes]
B: Each HCL is given a short survey about their personal experience and the 5 developmental factors. The surveys are collected and redistributed randomly among HCLs. Brandon facilitates reading each factor and asking person to stand up if person who filled out the survey they were given marked that factor. Brandon highlights frequency of each of these factors in general population and fact that people who experience same-sex attraction much more similar than different. Brandon shares own experience recognizing similarities and being able to look beyond labels and perceived differences. 
Discussion
Were you surprised by the prevalence and universality of these factors?
How does this awareness help you see SSA persons as similar to yourself?

Being a friend
Get to know the Person
Ask them about their story
Know their love languages
Point out shaming messages

[Notes]
B: want to provide you with some ideas of how you can be a good friend to anyone, but particularly those who experience SSA

Ask them about their story – everyone wants to be known

Love languages – can help us be better friend
words of affirmation
acts of service
receiving gifts
quality time
physical touch

Shaming messages – once know story, can point out lies from Satan

Being a friend
Encourage gender identification
Affirm their masculinity/femininity
words or actions; body or personality
Invite them to grow in their masculinity/femininity
include in activities; coach

[Notes]
P: mentioned earlier how important gender is: not that we look a certain way but that we feel part of the group
Being a friend
Treat them as same
Don’t treat them like a person of the opposite sex
Don’t coddle but don’t push away
Hold them accountable

B: you don't have to minister to them if you don't feel comfortable; just walk with them and involve a pastor if the person wants to address it directly
LGBT+ Persons
Be compassionate
Respect their right to choose
Minister to core wounds
Trust the Holy Spirit

128

[Notes]
B: training applies to all who experience SSA attraction, but first want to address posture toward LGBT+ persons

be compassionate 
     recognize sins of the Church 
     share that you are motivated by wanting the best things for the person
respect right to choose 
     you can’t control their choice anyway 
     just want them to be honest with themselves 
minister to core wounds (on development survey)
trust the HS
	trust that if what we believe is right is what is actually right, point people toward Christ and HS will convict them on its time
     obedience, not results
Ministering: Core Q’s
Will you treat me differently now that you know?
honesty
honor courage in sharing


[Notes]
B: For the rest of the time, we will concentrate on 8 core questions people who experience same-sex attraction are asking. This time is not meant to give you the answer to these questions, but to prepare you to help those you minister to think well about these questions. You could use these questions as a roadmap for ministering if a person is asking you to lead them, or you can be prepared to talk about these questions as the person you are ministering to brings these up.
Ministering: Core Q’s
How do I make sense of how I feel?
Why did God let this happen?
What is normal? What is abnormal?
How did this happen?
