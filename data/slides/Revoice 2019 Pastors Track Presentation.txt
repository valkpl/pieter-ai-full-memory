[Notes]
Welcome to the Pastors & Ministry Leaders Track!
Pastors & Ministry Leaders Track
Our goal: to help you lead your churches to become places where LGBT+ people can flourish according to historic Christian sexual ethics.

We want to help you become
Leaders to Flourishing.

[Notes]
Revoice exists to help your churches become places where LGBT+ people can flourish according to historic Christian sexual ethics.

Michelle, Bruce, and I share that hope, and today we want to help you take a few meaningful steps in that direction. We want to help you, Christian leaders, lead your churches to become places where LGBT+ can flourish. Or in a few words, we want you to become "Leaders to Flourishing."

We will do that in 5 ways:
Pastors & Ministry Leaders Track
Leaders to Flourishing
Michelle:	Transformative Vision and Strategy
Bruce:	 	Modeling and Teaching Historic 					Christian Sexual Ethics
Pieter: 		Answering the Big Questions

LUNCH BREAK (12:30 PM to 2 PM)

Panel: 		Church Accountability and Discipline
Q&A: 		What are you afraid of?
				Text your questions to 423-914-6258

[Notes]
Michelle will start by providing a framework for a longterm, wholistic vision and strategy for your church or denomination. How can you steward a movement that leads to deep transformation and bears good fruit for gay and straight people in your church?

Bruce will follow by demonstrating how pastors can invite all Christians, gay or straight, to think theologically about their sexual stewardship, how pastors can lead by modeling that in their personal lives, and how pastors can compassionately navigate resistance.

Next, I will give you language to engage in some of the trickiest conversations, including development of sexual orientation and change, sexual identity, how gay people can meet their intimacy needs in God-honoring ways, and what good things God has to offer LGBT+ people, in particular.

We’ll go until 12:30 pm. Then we'll take a break for lunch until 2 pm.

But after lunch, the three of us will tag-team to tackle one of the most difficult areas of pastoral care: church accountability and discipline. How can you show grace and confront sin effectively? We’ll even address how your church can minister to a same-sex married couple with kids who want to be part of your church while maintaining a progressive sexual ethic.

Then last but not least, we will round out our time with a segment we’re calling, “What are you afraid of?”
Throughout our time together, we want you to submit your toughest questions. What are you always afraid to ask? Text your questions to (423) 914-6258, and we will address them after lunch.

THE BIG

QUESTIONS




[Notes]
Alright, so you’ve explored a framework for long-term vision and strategy to lead LGBT+ in your church to flourishing

Then you’ve examined how you can lead by modeling as pastors and inviting everyone to think theologically about their sexual stewardship

Next, I want to offer language about how you can engage in some of the trickiest conversations, including development of sexual orientation and change, sexual identity, how gay people can meet their intimacy needs in God-honoring ways, and what good things God has to offer LGBT+ people

We’re gonna tackle some of the big questions



Pieter Valk of

[Notes]
But before we jump into that, I want to share with you a little about me
My name is Pieter Valk
I studied at Vanderbilt University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and Lipscomb University
I have my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and one day a week I meet with LGBT+ undergraduate students at a Christian university navigating questions of faith, sexuality, and identity

And the rest of the week, I’m the Executive Director of EQUIP
A team of missionary consultants who partner with churches to help them become places where LGBT+ people can belong and thrive according to an orthodox Christian sexual ethic 

how do we know when a church is doing this well? the Gay Teen Test



Gay Teen Test



Does your church…
Invite everyone to think theologically about sexual stewardship?
Talk publicly about their beliefs?
Ensure gay teens share early?
Provide effective one-on-one pastoral care?
Support thriving in celibacy and mixed-orientation marriages?





[Notes]
Our Gay Teen Test asks whether what gay teens in your church hear and see sets them up to fail or flourish. Does a mix of silence and hypocrisy in your church lead teens to reject a traditional sexual ethic and, often, God altogether because of their confusion, shame, fear, loneliness, and hopelessness? Or does your church courageously lead compassionate conversations about God’s love and plan for all people, setting up gay teens to embrace the beauty and the burden of the gospel? We focus on gay teens because if your church is a place where the young gay people already in your church are thriving, that’s a place where other gay people can find thriving as well.
There’s five parts to the Gay Teen Test
the first question on the Gay Teen Test: Is your church a place where everyone, gay or straight, is invited to think theologically about their sexual stewardship and live into God’s wisdom? This includes whether your church invites all people, gay or straight, to ask God whether He is calling them to celibacy or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex. And this includes taking what the Bible has to say about divorce and remarriage seriously.

question 2 on the Gay Teen Test: Does your church talk publicly about their beliefs about marriage, sexual orientation development and change, how gay people can meet their intimacy needs, and what good things God has to offer LGBT+ people? Does your church do this in a way that prepares straight people to have careful conversation and prevents gay people from having bait-and-switch experiences?

the third question on the Gay Teen Test: Does your church ensure that before teens realize they are gay, they’ve already heard their parents and pastors talk about God’s love for LGBT+ people and how He invites them to steward their sexualities? Does your church do this so that those gay teens share with parents and pastors soon after realizing their sexuality, all to prevent gay teen suicide, prevent gay teens leaving the faith, and ensure gay teens thrive according to an orthodox Christian sexual ethic?

question 4 on the Gay Teen Test: Are pastors and lay leaders in your church equipped to provide effective one-on-one pastoral care instead of shipping gay people offer to therapists or parachurch ministries?

and last but not least, the fifth question on the Gay Teen Test: Is your church a place where gay people would thrive in celibacy or a mixed-orientation marriage with reasonable effort? Can those called to celibacy find committed family with other celibate and married people? Can those in mixed-orientation marriages find meaningful support?

we help churches get to a place where they score a 5 out of 5 on the Gay Teen Test

In 5 years, we’ve trained more than 2,000 Christian leaders at 30 churches, campus ministries, and Christian universities

Finally, this work matters to me because I’m a Christian, I am gay, and God calls me to steward that according to an orthodox Christian sexual ethic
I need my church to score a 5 our of 5 on the Gay Teen Test
And I need the churches of the gay people I love to score a 5 our of 5 on the Gay Teen Test

Michelle spoke to question 3 of this list
Bruce spoke to questions 1 and 4 of this list
Shameless plug: I’ll be co-teaching a workshop on Saturday that will focus on question 5 of this list
But with my time today, I wanted to tackle question 2
I want to offer language about how you can answer some of the big questions





THE BIG

QUESTIONS




[Notes]
We’re going to tackle 8 questions that gay people often ask pastors as they are making sense of their faith and sexuality
I want to be clear: I’m not offering responses to these questions so you can go find the gay people in your church and tell them the answers
But I’m pretty confident that none of yall would do that
Instead, I raise these questions so that you can feel comfortable in these conversations when gay people raise them
Or, you might even have a gay person in your church asking you to lead them in making sense of their faith and sexuality
In that case, you can create space for these questions, listen well, and help the gay people in your churches think well about them



The Big Questions



Will you treat me differently now that you know?
Honesty
Honor courage in sharing

[Notes]
Terrifying when I first shared my story






Do you think I chose to be gay?
None of us are how God made us to be
Neither born gay nor chose to be gay
The Big Questions

[Notes]
For many, this gets down to the classic question: “are people born gay or do they choose to be gay”
Well I want to make clear right from the start, I never chose to be gay, and you never chose to be straight
Now to the second question: are people born gay
Twins and hormone studies inconclusive, suggestion predisposition
The consensus of scientists…
Not genetically determined
But even if it was, that doesn’t tell us anything about God’s intentions, whether it is good
That’s a theological question, not a scientific question
Science can’t answer the question of God’s intentions because none of us are how God made us to be
corrupted at genetic level and raised in broken world
So my answer: neither born gay nor choose to be gay







Do you think I chose to be gay?
Understanding developmental factors may help an individual gain acceptance but should not be addressed with the goal of “fixing” the individual
The Big Questions

[Notes]
For me this was helpful because it wasn’t a mystery anymore.
My experience also breaks the duality—it doesn’t fit in the culture war

My experience in counseling is that addressing emotional wounds doesn’t make people straight
It makes the a more well-adjusted gay person







Did God make me gay?
Does God make people gay?
Give people over to “a depraved mind”?
Allow people to develop same-sex attraction?
Play no part?
The Big Questions






Did God make me gay?
Did not intend for anyone to be gay or make anyone gay (James 1:13, Romans 1:26-27) 
We are all corrupted at a genetic level and grow up in a broken world (Psalm 51:5) 
God allowed it to happen (Romans 5:12)
The Big Questions






Did God make me gay?
If God protected us from the consequences of our actions and the actions of others, would we really have choice?
God seeks to redeem all brokenness for our good and His glory (Romans 8:28) 
The Big Questions

[Notes]
Question of Evil
No good answer







Will you try to make me straight?
No proven combination of spiritual disciplines or counseling to bring about change
Praying for change with any level of expectation is dangerous and unnecessary
The Big Questions

[Notes]
Scripture does not promise permanent relief from any temptation in this lifetime

Limited high-quality research demonstrates that only 3-4% of people who participated in sexual orientation change efforts experienced any change in their same-sex attractions, and even these results were from self-reports that cannot be verified.

No proven combination of spiritual disciplines or counseling to bring about change

Do miracles happen? Yes.

But praying for change with any level of expectation is dangerous.
The likelihood of your attractions changing even a little are the same as you getting into Harvard, becoming a millionaire, or playing high school baseball and eventually going pro. Would it be wise to pray for those things expectantly?
What happens when your faith in God, your belief that God is good, or your belief that God loves you hinges on whether you get into Harvard, become a millionaire, or your same-sex attractions change?
There is insufficient research about the effectiveness and harmfulness of sexual orientation change efforts in churches and counseling centers.
From my estimation of limited research and consistent anecdotal information, the frequent harm of ex-gay programs outweighs the benefits few experience.

Moreover, the search for change is unnecessarily risky: LGBT+ Christians don’t need to change their attractions to belong and thrive in our churches according to a traditional sexual ethic. Based on this, I would caution an individual from seeking to change their attractions. 

It’s a brokenness, but we don’t choose who we are attracted to and there is no formula for changing it
Better to ask God how he wants to redeem for my good and His glory






Where is God in all of this?
Reassure that God is not surprised or waiting for orientation change
Be honest with God—He can take it
Reject shame as a barrier to intimacy
Carefully invite God back into the conversation
The Big Questions

[Notes]
For many gay people, we felt shame before God about our sexuality at an early age
Then we tried to hide our sexuality from God so that we felt less shame
Then the Bible and prayer were used as weapons by Christians trying to make us straight
And then when we realized that we did nothing to bring our sexual orientation about, we couldn’t do anything to change it, and God didn’t respond to our pleas for Him to change it, we were angry at God for allowing us to be gay and not relieving us of this burden
All of this combines to leave gay people feeling like God is far away
They desperately want to feel close to God, but they don’t know how anymore

First, we can reassure them that God is not surprised, and He sees you as valuable (Psalm 139)
Reassure that you don’t have to become straight for God to love you
We are all broken and accepted before a gracious and merciful God who will never abandon us

Second, be honest with yourself and God—God can take it
I was really angry with God but suppressed that anger for a decade
Finally, I had a mentor who encouraged me to be honest
Jacob wrestling God—it is intimate
I had to express that anger before I could believe that God loves me—and honestly, I am still working through that

Third, help them clear out the shame that has become a barrier to connecting with God
Shame is often Satan’s primary weapon with sexual temptation
Our response: Identify, Reject, & Replace + Share
When we tell people to hide their attractions
Not to talk about them
Not to find community with people like them who understand their story
We heap on the shame

Fourth, invite God back into the conversation carefully
It is of upmost importance to strike the right balance between encouraging a personal relationship with Jesus, encouraging Bible reading and prayer, and not doing further damage or causing more shame.
For some LGBT people, this might mean patiently waiting for the Holy Spirit to heal old wounds caused by others who wielded Scripture and prayer as weapons.  For others, it may mean finding non-threatening ways to include Bible reading and prayer in their lives.

-This could mean using corporate prayers that are read aloud together during community group.  An LGBT person may feel disconnected from private prayer, perhaps having been assured countless times that God would heal them through prayer.  When He didn’t, prayer became a reminder of their failure to pray hard enough or God’s failure to act.  Corporate prayer may be a way for LGBT+ people to engage in prayer safely.
-This could mean avoiding “God is my friend”-type worship music.  For someone who has been convinced that God is disappointed or disgusted with them because of something they can’t control (their sexual attraction), God isn’t a friend.  He’s more like an angry giant.  Instead, churches can choose music that leans on theology or corporate lament or praise  instead of emotion-driven appeals.
-This may mean that God doesn’t “speak to” everyone when they read Scripture and that not everyone will benefit from a “personal devotion” or “quiet time.”  And being ok with Scripture used as learning about God’s character and the way He wants us to live.  Not everyone will find a personal meaning in Scripture that fits their exact circumstance and walk away from Bible study feeling that they were “fed” or “filled.”  Offer these Christians other ways to engage in Scripture and deepen their understanding of the character of God that isn’t dependent on emotions.
 
Of course, we hope that Bible-reading and prayer eventually lose their shame-producing capabilities.  We want gay people to think of God as a loving brother and hear His voice.  But for many LGBT people, that’s not the reality right now.  And it may never be.  So we can get creative with our discipling efforts.






Can I call myself gay?
Practice term-mirroring as hospitality
Distinguish between attractions, orientation, identity, and behavior
Create space for Christians to use the work gay
The Big Questions

[Notes]
Practice term mirroring as hospitality
Particularly if non-Christian

Distinguish between attractions, orientation, identity, and behavior

Create space for Christians to use the word gay
The reality is, both the word “gay” and the phrase “same-sex attraction” are unclear and carry baggage
There is no perfect term for ministry to LGBT+ non-Christians, gay teens in your church, and straight culture warriors in your church
I choose to use the word most effective with gay teens and then make clear what I mean
Why?

gay teens are 5 times more likely than their peers to attempt suicide
LGBT+ youth who are religious are 38% more likely to attempt suicide than their non-religious LGBT+ peers
Gay teens from highly rejecting families are 8.4 times more likely to attempt suicide than their LGBT+ peers
And, 54% of gay people who grew up in the church have left

Using words like “gay” and “LGBT” are most effective with gay teens
Regardless of how hard you try to shelter your children, these are the words they will hear their friends use and media use to describe people who experience same-sex attraction
So if you tried to communicate with teens about this subject using “same-sex attraction", you are likely to be confusing or irrelevant, at best, or hateful, at worst.
If you set up a false dichotomy that they can either identify as gay or be a Christian, you are adding to the Gospel, and Paul has strong words for “Christians” who add to the Gospel.
If you force them to use terms that no one in their generation uses, instead of using language that is definitionally neutral, you are much less likely to be effective.
If a teen who will one day realize they experience same-sex attraction grows up hearing most of the world name their experience as being “gay” but you only use that word in a derogatory way that is mutually exclusive to God’s love, you have set that student up to adopt a progressive sexual ethic, reject God all together, and/or contemplate suicide.

All of us use more than just the word Christian to describe ourselves
All of us identify around things that won’t continue in full into the NHNE

I think it’s also important to distinguish between using the word ”gay” phenomenologically vs. ontologically
I am using the word phenomenologically, not ontologically. When we define something phenomenologically, we are naming something based on one’s experience or what it appears to be. In contrast, when we ask who a person is ontologically, we are asking who they are innately, by design. When I use the word gay, I am not saying that I or someone else is ontologically gay. I am not saying that I am a fundamentally different person or that God designed me to be gay. I am merely noticing that I am attracted to other people of the same-sex and using (in my opinion) the best word to describe that experience.

Opportunity to share the gospel
"I am a Christian. I am gay. And I am convinced that God calls all Christians to celibacy or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex, including me.”
I am a child of God, first and foremost
Jesus and Jesus alone sits on the throne of my life
And I experience same-sex attraction
That has significantly impacted my journey and how I see the world
It has connected me with others who have similar experiences
I feel connected with people in the past who have had similar experiences
And I think I have something to offer the Church particularly because of my experiences
For those reasons I identify as gay to identify with others with similar experiences
I use the word gay to identify with people, not to identify with sin






 What do I do with my loneliness?
Ask, “What do you really need?”
Normalize intimacy needs
Jesus: angels in the wilderness and disciples in Gethsemane
Recognize meeting intimacy needs in healthy ways as an important spiritual discipline
The Big Questions

[Notes]
First ask what do you really need?
Do you really need something sexual or romantic?
Or do you need someone to talk, someone you know will be home when you get home, someone to celebrate with, someone to hold you when you cry
Often when we describe what we really need, its rarely something exclusively romantic or sexual

Next, normalize having intimacy needs, needing other people
If Jesus, the author and perfector of our faith needed the angels to attend to him in the wilderness and begged his disciples to stay up with him and pray with him before he was taken away—if our savior was a human with intimacy needs, its okay for us to have needs, its normal

Then recognize that if we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, our broken flesh will reach out for unsatisfying and destructive alternatives
Therefore, proactively meeting our intimacy needs in healthy ways is an important part of taking care of our temple
As Christians who reject spirit-body dualism, we need to embrace that taking care of our body is just as important as taking care of our soul
So our intimacy needs aren’t something to be ignored, they are something to be fulfilled






 What do I do with my loneliness?
Same-sex attractions are unmet needs for healthy same-sex intimacy that have been sexualized
Seek healthy relationships with safe friends

The Big Questions

[Notes]
Next, we can point out that same-sex attractions are unmet needs for healthy same-sex intimacy that have been sexualized
This doesn’t mean that if I meet all of my intimacy needs today, I won’t be gay tomorrow
But I have seen that when I’m getting what I really need—healthy friendship with other men—my desires for something romantic or sexual are easier to dismiss

So encourage those you disciple to seek out healthy relationships with safe friends
My life got better when I stopped ignoring my loneliness and started meeting my needs in healthy ways with deep friendship
And to this day, if I am struggling with lust, instead of shaming myself, I want my first response to be asking myself whether I have been meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways (which I haven’t)

I think some of this question isn’t just “what can I do with my loneliness today?”
But also, “how do I keep from being lonely in my 40s, 50s, and so on?”
To answer that, lets move to the last big question






 What future can I hope for?
A lifetime of sanctification and sexual stewardship
Intimacy with God and His family and working to redeem the world
Obedience to God’s teachings and surrendering our brokenness to God will bring goodness (Jeremiah 7:23)
The Big Questions

[Notes]
For gay people like me who have been stewarding our sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic for awhile, particularly in celibacy, this is our biggest question
We can white-knuckle our way through celibacy for a couple of years
But after awhile its exhausting to walk out a vocation with often little support from our church, family, or friends
Plus as we age, our friends get married, have kids, and don’t have time or space for us in their lives
We’re tired of hearing pastors tell us, “Jesus can be everything you need,” when those pastors don’t live that life
Those pastors have a spouse and kids to go home to every night

So, what future can gay Christian hope for?










 What future can I hope for?
God invites everyone to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
At a church that gets a 5 out of 5 on the Gay Teen Test, both are equally good and available to gay people
The Big Questions

[Notes]
But there in lies the problem
I’ve never met a church that gets more than a 2 our of 5 on the gay teen test
If we’re being honest, most of your churches aren’t places that can offer gay people much hope right now
The best way you can answer this question is by being honest
For most of you, an honest answer is, “I wish this weren’t the case, but our church has been doing a poor job of supporting single and gay people for decades. I wish I could promise you that that will get better soon, but I can’t. The cross you’ll bear will probably be more painful than many of your peers. I am sorry. The world is not supposed to be this way. Our church is not supposed to be this way. So I personally give you permission to hold me feet to the fire on this. Don’t stop reminding me that things must be different, and quickly.”

Don’t be afraid to apologize for the sins of the Church, confess on behalf of the church
You don’t need to apologize for your beliefs, but you can apologize that the Church hasn’t done enough to be a place where gay people could thrive with reasonable effort according to a traditional sexual ethic

And finally after you apologize, affirm their need for committed, intimate family
Ultimately, they want hope that they will find family
God has created each of us for family
Yet most gay people have had a hard time finding it
I’ll end with a shameless plug
To learn what practical steps your church can take to become a place where gay people can thrive in celibacy or a mixed-orientation marriage with reasonable effort, come to EQUIP’s workshop on Saturday morning
