LOVING

SEXUAL & GENDER MINORITIES




[Notes]
When I’m not in classes or interning here at the UCC, I am the Executive Director of EQUIP
nonprofit Christian consulting ministry committed to equipping the Church to better love sexual and gender minorities
we come alongside churches to provide them with the understanding and skills to become places where sexual and gender minorities can belong
ultimate goal is that next generations grow up hearing complex and compassionate theology about sexuality so that if SSA, can share with parents, pastor, or friends without fear or shame
worked with Ethos Church and Lipscomb University at a variety of levels

this work means a lot to me because reconciling my same-sex attraction with my faith tradition has been a big part of my story
and, part of that journey was meeting with a counselor who could help me accomplish my goals, which inspired me to be a counselor
coming full circle, I’ve had the privilege of serving clients here whom that is a part of their story
clients with variety of faith backgrounds, levels of identity, and desire to seek same-sex romantic or sexual relationships
and because politically charged topic, highly personal for clients, much past pain, and I talk publically about my story, have been on the receiving end of powerful transference from client that ultimately destroyed one therapeutic alliance: reality is, no matter how good of a counselor you are or how careful you are, things happen

so Andrea invited me to partner with her in this training because of my personal experience with same-sex attraction and in counseling, my work more broadly on this topic at Lipscomb, and my work with sexual minority clients here at Lipscomb

What’s the Same?




What’s the Same?
Not Homogenous




[Notes]
like any other group of people, they are not homogenous
want to highlight one of those ways there is diversity within group not mentioned by Andrea
as we learned, attraction, identity, and expression are often related but not necessarily inseparable things
what you may find, particularly among Christian clients who are sexual minorities, is an acceptance of the attraction (that they won’t change)
and maybe even an identification with other sexual minorities because of their share experience
but may choose not to express in form of seeking romantic or sexual relationship
we need to respect that and be prepared for it



What’s the Same?
Not Homogenous
Feel Feelings & Think Thoughts




[Notes]
just like any client
they need to fully feel their feelings
core emotions of anger, sadness, fear, and joy
believe that emotions are good: they communicate to us
there are no bad emotions, only painful ones
feeling can never be avoided, only postponed
they need to be in touch with their thoughts
if not aware and in control, our thoughts will drive our experience
perception is reality, so taking hold of our thoughts can change reality

all people need to feel and think



What’s the Same?
Not Homogenous
Feel Feelings & Think Thoughts
Achieve Congruence




[Notes]
just like any other client, achieving some level of congruence is important
but also like any other client, we won’t always find complete congruence between our desires and beliefs, and we shouldn’t force that upon clients
for most all of us, we hold some tension between our id (our wants, drives, and desires) and super-ego (cultural values)
our goal is to strengthen each client’s ego to moderate between id and super-ego to accomplish the client’s long term goals, regardless of your assessment of those goals



What’s the Same?
Not Homogenous
Feel Feelings & Think Thoughts
Achieve Congruence
Meet Intimacy Needs




[Notes]
we are all created for intimacy
we all have a need for connection and attachment—to know others and be known
and we all have physical, spiritual, and emotional needs
there’s debate about whether we have a need for sex, or just a need for physical, spiritual, and emotional intimacy
but regardless, sexual and gender minorities have these needs like anyone else
and if we don’t meet our needs in healthy ways, our ID has a way of grabbing for lowest hanging fruit that is often destructive and unsatisfying
helping those clients identify their intimacy needs and meet them in healthy ways is powerful



What’s the Same?
Not Homogenous
Feel Feelings & Think Thoughts
Achieve Congruence
Meet Intimacy Needs
Strengthen Autonomy




[Notes]
Each flavor of the helping professions has different ideas about what the highest value is, but if you average them you’ll arrive at autonomy
the client is in control, and our job is to help him or her accomplish those goals
sometimes the client needs help clarifying what he or she wants
but, we all know the power we have as counselors to tip the scale if we want to
we must resist that urge
for example, we must not choose for our clients which to compromise when there is tension: cultural beliefs or desires



What’s Different?




What’s Different?
Studies show higher rates of these among sexual and gender minorities:
Anxiety
Depression
Suicide
Body Shame




[Notes]
what do we do with this information?
don’t be surprised if you find it, and be competent in serving



What’s Different?
Higher amounts of shame

Depending on the individual’s beliefs: reject shame altogether or replace with a healthy view of self and guilt




[Notes]
shame is a powerfully negative experience among those who have spent a lifetime hiding
those who have spent a lifetime hearing the world say they are bad or different or weird
and they start to believe that they are bad
multiple ways to push back
if believes homosexual activity morally neutral, then want to wholly reject shame
if believes homosexual activity a sin, replace shame with guilt and healthy view of self




What’s Different?
Acute need for freedom
To share their story
From shame or fear or hiding
To identify with others
To advocate with others




[Notes]
acute need for freedom (model the relationship in counseling) 
between men and women I know who experience same-sex attraction and gender identity questions, no correlation between seeking romantic/sexual relationships or not and happiness, strong correlation between freedom with story/being out and happiness



What’s Different?
Psychosocial developmental delays
College sophomores who are 19 years old but at the psychosocial development of a 13 year old
Identity formation




[Notes]
developmentally delayed because of societal block 
“psychosocial developmental delays" 
ex) moving countries and learning a new language 
identity formation (everyone needs it but these clients in particular)



What’s Different?
Politically/theologically charged
Don’t impose your values in either direction
Let the client lead
Lean on supervision




[Notes]
don’t assume something is there if we don’t see it 



Practice




Practice
A client asks you, “Do you think homosexuality is wrong?” or “Do you think everyone is either a man or a woman?”

How do you respond?




[Notes]
Discussion question: practice not answering question 
Even if they push you to give them advice, not an invite
