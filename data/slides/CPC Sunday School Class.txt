Our Mission
To equip the Church with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction




[Notes]
need: gay teen suicide, hate crime, feel unwelcome

challenge: pastors and parents don’t know how to minister or teach
because they don’t have the understanding or skills

solution: equip with understanding and skills
partner with churches to provide training from top down
to minister, teach, and support
according to a traditional sexual ethic: celibacy or MOM




Our Vision
We want the Church we leave our children to be one where boys and girls grow up hearing their parents, friends, and pastors talk about sexuality in compassionate and meaningful ways. And if those boys and girls find themselves attracted to other boys or girls of the same sex, we want them to be able to share with their parents, friends, or pastors without fear or shame.






VOCAB




Terms & Definitions
Lots of options and no perfect term

Use whatever vocabulary you are most comfortable with






Terms & Definitions
Experience SSA vs. Gay vs. Homosexual vs. LGBQTIA vs. Sexual Minority vs. Queer
Gay Celibate Christian?
Side A/B/X




[Notes]
To demonstrate how many options there are and the problems with each of them, let me make some quick comments about some different terms
Experience SSA – describes only a person’s attraction but associated with pray-the-gay-away and gay-to-straight therapy, so offensive to gay people
Gay - meant SSA + same-sex romantic/sexual relationships to earlier generations, if asked middle schooler today would just say SSA
Homosexual - outdated term often used to refer to SSA as a mental disorder

Then there’s a search for a umbrella term
LGBQTIA - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual + always adding letters
Sexual Minority - umbrella term includes gay, lesbian, bisexual, and asexual people—anyone with a non-majority sexual experience
Queer - A newly-reclaimed, umbrella term that includes sexual and gender minorities (anyone with a gender non-conforming experience). Queer is the preferred term by many hoping to find power in taking back the word and using it in place of LGBTQIA.

Perhaps you’ve heard some Christians who experience SSA and have traditional beliefs identify is gay—why?
Shared heritage
Similar life experiences
Unique perspective in the Body of Christ
Still secondary and operated by my identity in Christ



Side A



God makes people gay
God blesses same-sex marriages in the same ways that He blesses opposite-sex marriages
Requires theological maneuvering or a belief that the Bible is not binding/prescriptive for a modern context 



Side B



Same-sex attraction is a result of the Fall
We do not choose who we are attracted to and there is no formula for changing one’s attractions
Same-sex romantic and sexual activity are sins
All people are called to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Christians can identify as gay in limited ways




Side X



Same-sex attracted Christians must reject their attractions and work toward change
Continuing to experience SSA is a sign of willful disobedience
Homosexuality is sinful
God intends for all people to marry someone of the opposite sex



MY STORY


[Notes]
experiencing same-sex attraction and reconciling that with traditional Christian beliefs that God calls all people to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
I felt that alone, afraid, shame, dirty in middle school when I started to realize my attractions
Prayed daily that God would fix me, make me normal, make me straight
I didn’t have parents or a church around me where I thought it was safe
All I knew was God was against homosexuality—didn’t hear anyone talk about these things in theological or compassionate ways
listening the Chris Rice song and crying so terrified to tell parents but knowing I had to
telling parents and nothing + telling youth pastor and nothing
Got to college and took the risk of fully known and fully loved
shared my story with entire fraternity (terrifying and awesome) and starting doing life with other people
finally let myself be angry with God (particularly over assumption that I am necessarily called to celibacy because I am gay)
Met with a therapist just wanting to find peace and meaning in life
biggest take-away was that it is good and normal that I need relationship with other men and I shouldn’t be afraid of that
leaned into friendship with others
any open to a relationship with a woman

Over the past four year it has set in that the Church isn’t a place where I can thrive in celibacy
what do you expect me to do?
sadness of seeing friends choose between A and X and I don’t blame them




FLOURISHING


[Notes]
That highlighted a lot of the questions I wanted us to discuss today:
what is God offering LGBT+ people and how is that good?
Is the Church offering what God wants to offer LGBT+ people? Spoiler, NO
How can the Church do this better?

So, how does God invite LGBT+ people to flourish?



Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of abstinent singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to lifelong marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Others called to lifelong celibacy and intimate family in the Body of Christ

[Notes]
Here is my summary of God’s narrative for sexual stewardship

God offers relationship with Him and the Body of Christ as the solution to loneliness
Spiritual friendship is a satisfying source of companionship available to all
Marriage is a vocation for the purpose of raising children
God calls many to a flourishing life of celibacy
All enjoy deep friendship in the Body of Christ and support each other in their vocations



How is this good?



If the Church did this well, it would be a place where those who experience SSA could thrive in celibacy or a mixed orientation marriage (MOM)

Their callings would be just as beautiful and the challenges would be no greater

[Notes]
what does that mean for those who experience SSA?
and why does God’s narrative for sexual stewardship matter to us?

celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex (just like straight people!)
I can imagine yall have a lot of thoughts and feelings about MOMs – hold that, we will get to it very soon

church where celibacy taught and valued and just as good
other straight people celibate and thriving
church that recognizes brokenness and talks about brokenness of sexuality
also recognizes what marriage really is
so can thrive in MOM

everyone enjoys meaningful community in the Body of Christ



PROBLEMS


[Notes]
but that assumes that the Church is doing this well
news story: We AREN'T
where are our areas of growth?
we can’t get better until we admit we have a problem and we identify them




The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
We don’t really believe those things
Few churches teach those things
And even fewer put them into practice



What we believe…



If God gives people desires to marry and have kids, then He wants them to marry
Marriage is primarily about companionship and mutual fulfillment
If we get married, we only have to have kids if and when we want them
God calls a select few to celibacy and sustains them spiritually
Friendship can’t provide what marriage can and shouldn’t be too close



Turn & Talk
How are these beliefs problematic? What are the consequences of these beliefs for all people and specifically Christians who experience same-sex attraction?

The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
Straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage
There is no support for celibacy
We live disconnected, isolated lives

[Notes]
As a result,

we don’t refrain from emotional and physically intimate relationships before marriage
we assume we will be married, that marriage will satisfy, and that marriage is about making you happy
we no longer honor “through thick and thin” or see raising children as central
straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage

few consider celibacy as a calling
relegated to a curse of loneliness for the sake of the gospel
there is no support for celibacy because no straight people aren't doing it

don’t learn to do friendship well, have loose friendships
fear of close, same-sex friendships
don’t do life as a Body of Christ



The Problem(s)



This hurts Christians who experience SSA
Cannot thrive in celibacy or a MOM
We offer only Side A or Side X
Why should gay people be called to a higher standard of sexual stewardship?

[Notes]
we don’t offer an alternative that recognizes the challenges and answers questions people have

if we do not do this, we cannot blame unmarried people for reaching out for forbidden things from a place of loneliness

if straight people aren’t taking marriage seriously or considering celibacy, why should gay people call themselves to a higher standard of sexual stewardship



The Problem(s)



This hurts straight Christians, too
Children grow up hearing all people will be straight, married, and have kids
Failed marriages due to refusing a call to celibacy and inaccurate expectations
Celibates struggle with loneliness and married people raise children alone



Turn & Talk
How have you seen these shortcomings in your community?

How have they impacted Christians in your community—both gay and straight?

BETTER


[Notes]
So how can we do this better as a church, and specifically, how can we become places where gay Christians can thrive in celibacy or a MOM



A Vision for Better



Offer God’s narrative for sexual stewardship for all people
Talk about the people and circumstances in the margins, including SSA
Start talking about this at an early age
Effectively minister to LGBT+ people
Become churches where people can thrive in celibacy and MOMs

[Notes]
In short, if you want to serve LGBT+ people well, it takes more than a pastor who can minister individual to LGBT+ people. That is good, and if that pastor truly grasps the complexity of the problem, he or she can lead that congregation toward a real solution:

I highlighted the first and second briefly
Why we need to start early—
I want to focus on the 5th





Thriving in Celibacy



Model it – church leadership
Talk about it – across the lifespan
Discern it – listen and accept the call
Support it – integrate them in families
Celebrate it – show that it is valued

[Notes]
model it
put celibate people in places of leadership and up front
unless see it valued won’t believe it is really a great option

talk about it across the lifespan
children need celibacy to be mentioned every time they talk about marriage
they need to have celibate people in their families
we need to preach about it
there need to be catechism opportunities around it

need a process of discernment to help accept a call to it

support it
they need intimate, spiritually procreative, and covenant-bound relationships that are maintained through sacrifice
people need to be given a vision of it and called to it
provide incubator where risk is reduced (subsidize it)
give instructions to make it happen
hold people accountable
seek out celibate people in the church and ask them about their experience
church language (“if” instead of “when”)

celibates as Godparents
calling families to include in rhythms, vacations, holidays, living
rhythms in the church to make this happen
help celibates create families of their own

celebrate it
mother’s day, father’s day, anniversaries, marriages, engagement parties, baptism, baby showers
what for celibates? how do we mark and celebrate their commitment?



Thriving in MOMs



Teach accurately about what marriage is and isn’t to normalize MOMs
Encourage MOMs to share about SSA inside and outside of the marriage, accept that it will probably always be there, and steward it together

[Notes]
define

pendulum over past few decades
80s, 90s, and early 00s - everyone needs to marry + pray the gay away
late 00s, 10s - reaction to failures, everyone needs to be celibate

don't pressure people into them: doesn’t work for everyone
what the bible has to say about celibacy

don’t discredit: we only hear about the ones that fail

when it’s done well
talk about it before engagement (recognize that it will always be a part of marriage—it returns, work of Satan)
talk about it in marriage
talk about it with other couples
opinions of secular sex therapists: recipe for marital satisfaction and sexual satisfaction is emotional intimacy + commitment (sexual attraction not necessary)

So as a result

talk about them and normalize them

talk about what marriage is and isn’t:
If marriage is primarily about sexual attraction and companionship, then perhaps MOMs won’t work
But if it’s about emotional intimacy and vulnerability, commitment, and raising children together, then they can thrive

share with other person, recognize it will always be there, steward together, share with others (to see that most of your challenges are universal and not due to SSA)




Turn & Talk
What are your reservations and fears about MOMs? Could they work for those called to them?

What steps is your community willing to take to become a place where LGBT+ people can thrive in celibacy or a MOM?
