SSA vs sexual minority


Training Overview
Part One: Theology & Being a Friend
Part Two: AMA & Development of SSA
Part Three: Sensitivity & How to Minister


[Notes]
disclaimer: not exhaustive
questions and clarification
Part One Recap
Theology
Why we believe what we believe
What we should offer as an alternative to the gay lifestyle

Why we believe it
Neither marriage nor sex promised or necessary to meet needs
Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges

[Notes]
If we were part of a church that really believed this and supported this, we wouldn’t just be asking SSA to refrain and it would actually be possible to meet out intimacy needs in community with God and the Body of Christ
What we should offer
Accurate theology about marriage
Nondiscriminatory application of Scripture
Shame-free church to talk about experience
Robust culture of singleness
Spiritual friendship to meet intimacy needs
Complex understanding of gender
Part One Recap
Being a Friend
Get to know the person
Encourage gender identification
Treat them as same


[Notes]
ask them about their story
as we will see today, gender key, so for those wanting to grow in masculinity/femininity, you can support that
don’t treat like someone of the opposite sex or as different from self (we will see more of that today)
PART TWO:Hear a Story & Development of SSA
Session Goal
To better empathize and recognize shared experiences with sexual minorities by hearing the story of someone who experiences SSA and considering common factors in the development of SSA. 

12

[Notes]
story: empathize with sexual minorities, impact of family, church, and society, how easily I could have become someone else (empathize and provide scaffolding)
development: see how little choice sexual minorities have, identify common experiences with self (demystify and see commonalities)
both of these give you a better foundation for ministering to sexual minorities
Hear a Story

[Notes]
Pain and redemption
Not over
Very common
Questions to Consider
What aspects of the story are similar to your own?
What significant events/relationships contributed to the development of SSA?
How did the Church fail to respond (both parents and pastors)?
Can you empathize with the pain and suffering?

Developmentof SSA

[Notes]
development: see how little choice sexual minorities have, identify common experiences with self
Development of SSA
Correlated but not necessarily causal
At least 5 of 8 factors involved in 90% of cases
Every process is unique
Common among OSA individuals

[Notes]
Matheson believes causal, but hard to prove (has not yet been published)

Connecting to my story but apply to women
Woven in all of these effects of spiritual attack, sins of others, personal sin, and generational sin
Often seems like Satan is the orchestrator of the perfect storm that these factors contribute to
child’s perception, not reality

Looked in other places

Learning








Development of SSA
Biological and Physical
Genes – predisposed, not determined
Physical bodies 
size, proportionality, athleticism,  secondary sex characteristics
Emotional disposition 
temperament and aptitude

[Notes]
Gay gene has not been found
Twins studies 48%
I can speak with authority
Doubt this factor alone could cause SSA

Probably genetic predisposition
Less athletic, narrow shoulders
Didn’t like rough-housing

Development of SSA
Learning
We associate ideas and adopt behaviors based on our experiences, which are reinforced by rewards and punishments
Neurons that fire together wire together

[Notes]
we learn some aspects of our sexuality
associate things that weren’t once linked

Anxiety and fear -> erections
Previous factor -> insecurity and inferiority
Confident guys -> anxiety -> erection
Society says erection = attraction

Very common
Teenagers = hormones
Pornography
Perfect men in heterosexual porn

My example in story
Development of SSA
Sexual Abuse
Common
From the same or opposite sex
Gender incongruity or opposition to opposite sex
Shame
Development of SSA
Psychological Issues
Shame
Anxiety
Depression
Isolation

Obsessive compulsion
Addiction
Trauma
Many others

Development of SSA
Take-aways
Predisposed but not determined
No one chooses SSA
Wholeness is a process
Gender is impactful
Development of SSA
Take-aways
Pornography is destructive
Everyone has experienced one of these
Sexual attraction is not an oppositional binary

Discussion

Which factors were you surprised by?
Which factors did you expect?
Have any of these factors been a part of your story?

Female vs Male SSA

Attractions, Emotional Dependency, and Sexual Behavior

Search for Home

The Heart of Female Same-sex Attraction

[Notes]
Home = stability, trust, protection, and safety in mother and father

Without, in search of home -> codependent relationships with other women

healthy attachment with same-sex parent crucial.
