how this fits into Lead Team Training and initiative as whole:

session 1-2: provide understanding
session 3: capitolize on that understanding with practical advice and tools

understanding -> confidence that you can minister

then enhance your learning by getting you to teach this in HC Leader Training and Grow Class

and max out Ethos’ capacity to love and serve by equipping HC Leader, congregation, and support group

Women dangerous
No complementarity
Nothing to offer

Healthy: identify and distinguish: exotic, different, complimentary, give and take
