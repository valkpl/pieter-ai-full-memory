BELIEVE




Invite others to Believe.
What?

Why?

So What?




Believe



What?



Experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin.

Homosexual activity is a sin.

No promise of change in SSA.

We do not choose who we are attracted to but we choose how we respond.

Believe

[Notes]
what I believe
shared by Ethos
they’re good ones
similar
different



What?



Any sin can separate us from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all.

God promises transformation of the heart and provision of fullness to anyone who seeks Him faithfully.

Believe



What?



God calls the Church to love those who experience SSA regardless of what their journeys look like.

God loves LGBT+ people and He values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ.

Believe
35



Share.
Do you know what you believe?

Would you feel comfortable sharing with others?

Why or why not?




Believe
41



Why?



Preponderance of Biblical support

Same-sex sexual activity is sin

Marriage defined between man and women

Context of rape, incest, adultery, or sex outside of marriage

Written for a people in a time and place

Believe



Why?



Created for perfect intimacy with God and the Body of Christ

Intimacy needs are good and normal

Neither sex nor marriage are promised or necessary to meet intimacy needs

Believe

[Notes]
deeper, foundational truths about how God created us as relational beings
you’ll see how we don’t really believe these or act upon them

define intimacy needs
God creates Eve, Jesus when tempted and in garden, in Heaven
if we don’t meet in healthy ways or will meet in unhealthy ways

so for the sexual minority, yes, you were created for intimacy, but no one is promised or needs sex or marriage to meet their intimacy needs

but we don’t know how to meet needs outside of marriage or sex
and straight people don’t do this, so why should sexual minorities?




Why?



The Blessing of Singleness (really)

Every person is first called to singleness

Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges

Believe

[Notes]
regardless of whether marriage later, all people should learn to do this well first

few churches teach these things
Church lift marriage on a pedestal and fail to provide support for single people to do singleness well



Why?



The Uniqueness of Christian Marriage

One man and one woman before God

Reflection of intimacy and complementarity in trinity

Centrality of child-rearing
Responsibility and commitment

Believe

[Notes]
many called out of singleness into marriage

it’s not that we’re saying we don’t want gay people to be happy
its just that Christian marriage has been uniquely reserved for a specific purpose

instead what we often hear in the church is that every has a right to be married and the purpose of marriage is to make you happy



Why?



All are called to steward sexuality in inconvenient ways

All can meet their intimacy needs in singleness

Believe

[Notes]
the invitation to those who experience same-sex attraction is no less good and the challenges are no more great



Why?



Instead…

All are promised marriage 

We can’t meet our intimacy needs as single people 

Marriage is about being happy and we don’t need permission

Believe

[Notes]
so we shouldn’t be surprised that no one takes us seriously
that leaves us with a challenge as a church to foster a community where people can meet their intimacy needs as single people and teach accurately about marriage





So what?
People don’t care what we believe or why we believe it.

They care whether we are offering something better.




Believe
51



Share.
Do you see and talk about marriage as the answer to loneliness?

Would single adults be able to meet their intimacy needs in meaningful friendship in your community?

Do you invite sinners of all kinds to share about their experience without shame or ultimatums?




Believe
57



So what?
Offer something better




Believe

[Notes]
if we really want to convince people—if we want them to believe and become—we have to offer something better—it’s on us



Be the Church.



Accurate theology about marriage

Nondiscriminatory application of Scripture

Shame-free church to talk about experience

Robust culture of singleness

Spiritual friendship to meet  intimacy needs

Believe



A better strategy.
