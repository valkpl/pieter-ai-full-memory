3

[Notes]
goal is to help you to think well and love well 
whether you are an RA next year, will all be leaders in the Church and need to think well and love well 
today I’ll share with you a little bit of what I believe and why but also where that leaves us as a church, and then we are going to spend some time talking about how you can minister to those around you
NOTE about terms
PART ONE:Think Well

[Notes]
why is it important to think well?
we act from our beliefs
My Beliefs
Experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin
Homosexual activity is a sin
No promise of change in SSA
We do not choose who we are attracted to but we choose how we respond
Any sin can separate us from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all


[Notes]
my beliefs and also align with university
you don’t have to believe what I believe
but I do think these are good ways to think about this topic
My Beliefs
God promises transformation of the heart and provision of fullness to anyone who seeks Him faithfully
God calls the Church to love those who experience SSA regardless of what their journeys look like
God loves LGBT people and He values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ


But why?

[Notes]
worthwhile to explore why we believe what we believe
share with you why I believe what I believe
if you find yourself with similar beliefs as me, might be some ideas you can add to the way you think about these things
for those who think differently, challenge you to consider these ideas and allow them to dialogue with your own
But why?

[Notes]
Every time the bible talks about same-sex sexual activity, calls it a sin
If bible every specifies, defines marriage as between a man and a woman
but also recognize no one in the bible addresses a loving, monogamous same-sex couple
we know bible first written for a people in a time, place, and culture

Broader Theological Themes
Natural Law
No examples in nature
Anal sex unnatural
Physical and mental health risks

[Notes]
Asserting dominance and ambiguous sex, but no analog to Modern Family

anal bleeding
Excretion
lose control of bowel movements
Risk: colon cancer

Prevalence: HIV infection
alcohol and substance abuse
Suicide

I don’t assert these to argue that homosexuality necessarily causes these things
oppression and discrimination are often causes
which leads us to a broader question


Natural Law
What makes a sin sinful?
Arbitrary lines? No
Fun things? No
That which will hurt us
But why?

Broader Theological Themes

[Notes]
historical area or weakness
rooted in deeper, foundational truths
Broader Themes
Created for perfect intimacy with God and His family
Intimacy needs normal and good
Neither marriage nor sex promised or necessary to meet needs

[Notes]
must meet in healthy ways or will meet in unhealthy ways
God creates Eve, Jesus when tempted and in garden, in Heaven

don’t know how to meet needs outside of
Broader Themes
The Blessing of Singleness (really)
Every person is first called to singleness
Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges

[Notes]
and regardless of whether marriage later, all people should learn to do this well first

can meet intimacy needs as single person as best as any

we don’t believe they are equal

Broader Themes
The Uniqueness of Christian Marriage
One man and one woman before God
Reflection of intimacy and complementarity in trinity
Centrality of procreation
Responsibility and commitment
21

[Notes]
called out of singleness into marriage
vocation to raise children for kingdom

why are these foundational beliefs important? how do they inform how we think about homosexual activity?
shows that all called to steward sexuality in inconvenient ways

asking SSA persons to steward sexuality (likely singleness) wouldn’t be so outlandish if we were already asking OSA Christians to do the same (first commit themselves to singleness and only some enter marriage if called and with proper understanding of responsibility-A JOB and commitment-NO DIVORCE)
Why we believe it
…people don’t care

Does the Church offer something better?
What we really offer
Lie that people need and are promised marriage
Singling out gays while ignoring divorce/adultery
Church culture of silence and fear of subject
Nearly impossible to live out singleness
Spiritual friendship nonexistent
Rigid, simplistic understanding of gender
What we should offer
Accurate theology about marriage
Nondiscriminatory application of Scripture
Shame-free church to talk about experience
Robust culture of singleness
Spiritual friendship to meet intimacy needs
Complex understanding of gender

[Notes]
Challenge you, future leaders in our churches, to commit yourselves to bring this about
