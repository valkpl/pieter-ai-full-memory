How has God created us for intimacy in the context of family?
What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?



INTIMACY & FAMILY


[Notes]
first we’re going to start with the foundation
How has God created each of us for intimacy in the context of family, regardless of sexual orientation?

Why start here?
When we attempt to talk to teens and young adults about sex, dating, intimacy, and family, we typically focus on urging them to refrain from sexual activity. 
But by focusing only on dating, sex, and marriage when we try to communicate a biblical sexual ethic, we admit that the best things in life are sex and marriage. To those who will never marry or have sex (for whatever reason), we mislead them into believing that their calling is lesser. And to those who will marry, and have sex, we set false expectations that marriage and sex will end loneliness and fulfill them completely. Plus, a focus on dating, marriage, and sex communicates to gay people that if they obey God’s teachings, they are likely to miss out on the best things that God has to offer. 

When we focus only on sex and marriage, the Church suffers, too: very few people submit to the calling of singleness in order to serve God with undivided attention, more Christians fall into pornography usage (somewhere around 10% of Christian women and 64% of Christian men view pornography at least monthly https://www.provenmen.org/pornography-survey-statistics-2014/), divorce rates soar when the fulfillment we were promised doesn’t come (among those who attend church regularly, about 38% have been divorced https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/factchecker-divorce-rate-among-christians/#_ftn1), and 54% of gay people who grow up in the Church end up leaving the faith (Us versus Us by Andrew Marin). We must offer something better.

We need to zoom out to include more of the possibilities God has for us and frame the conversation around the right questions: How has God created all of us for intimacy with God and other humans? What are the best ways for every person to enjoy human intimacy in the context of family? How are all of us called to submit to God our capacities for romance and sex? How can all of us enjoy deep relationship in committed community, regardless of whether we’re called to committed singleness or Christian marriage? To answer those questions, to figure out what we’re made for, maybe we should start by looking at our Creator. At God.





Intimacy & Family



God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.

God is a being who enjoys intimacy in the context of family, and He created us in His image for those same things.

[Notes]
God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.

How do we know that? Because God is a being who enjoys intimacy in the context of family, and He created us in His image for those same things.
 
God put Himself in families. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit make up a family called the Trinity. And the Trinity created this world, made man, gave us choice, and sent His son to live a perfect life and die on the cross for our sins so that we could be a part of His family. The Bible goes even further to establish that God is in family and He invites us into that family by calling us, the group of people who follow Jesus, Christ’s bride and calling Jesus our groom. We’re being married into the family of God.  

(SKIP) In John 3:29, John the Baptist meets Jesus for the first time and describes himself as a guest at a wedding where Jesus is the groom and the people of God are his bride. In Ephesians 5 Paul uses an analogy of a husband and wife to teach Christ-followers to submit to God and to celebrate that we are Christ’s bride. Finally, in Revelation 19:6-9, the Apostle John describes a wedding feast at the end of time when Christ returns triumphantly to celebrate being united with his bride, the Church—that’s us!



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)

[Notes]
But God isn’t just a being in a family. The love enjoyed in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church is a particular kind of love. Historically, Christians have characterized that love in six ways: God’s love is complementary, intimate, procreative, faithful, sacrificial, and hospitable:

First, God’s love is complementary or diverse. There is a different-ness between the persons of the Trinity—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. And there is complementarity between Christ and his bride, the Church.






Intimacy & Family



“After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne…” (Revelations 7:9)

[Notes]
(SKIP) In Revelations 7:9, the Apostle John describes a celebration of the diversity of God’s people: “After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne…”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)

[Notes]
Second, God’s love is intimate. The persons of the Trinity know each other perfectly and are fully known by each other.




Intimacy & Family



“‘My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they...be one as we are one—I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.’” (John 17:20)

[Notes]
(SKIP) In John 17:20, Jesus speaks longingly about the Trinity when praying for his disciples: “‘My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they...be one as we are one—I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.’
 




Intimacy & Family



“...At that moment heaven was opened, and [Jesus] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’” (Matthew 3:16-17)

[Notes]
God the Father reciprocates this affection. Just after Jesus is baptized, the following happens in Matthew 3:16-17” “...At that moment heaven was opened, and [Jesus] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’”



Intimacy & Family



“Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. We love because he first loved us.” (1 John 4: 7, 8, and 19)

[Notes]
Plus, Christ intimately knows and loves His people and wants them to seek out relationship with Him.

(SKIP)  1 John 4: 7, 8, and 19 say, “Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. We love because he first loved us.” We can only love because God Himself is love, made us to be creatures who love, and loved us first.




Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)

[Notes]
Third, God’s love is procreative or life-giving. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit made the world, filled it with animals, and made us humans, together. The Trinity gave us life. And then God became man and Jesus lived and died for us so that we could have life.

In John 10:10 Jesus says, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” Without Jesus we are dead people walking. We have sinned against God, and we do not deserve to join Him in heaven. But Jesus paid the price for our sins so that we could have eternal life.
 
Fourth, the love of God is faithful or permanent. There is a perfect and permanent faithfulness in the Trinity and from Christ to His people. No matter what we do, God will never abandon us or withhold his love.




Intimacy & Family



“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is [God’s] faithfulness.” (Lamentations 3:22-23)

[Notes]
(SKIP) Lamentations 3:22-23 says it this way: “The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is [God’s] faithfulness.”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)

[Notes]
Fifth, the love of God is sacrificial. As we’ve already mentioned, Jesus offered himself up as a perfect sacrifice so that all of God’s children could return to Him. 




Intimacy & Family



“You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly... But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:6 and 8)

[Notes]
(SKIP) Paul describes Christ’s sacrifice in this way in Romans 5:6 and 8: “You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly... But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)
Hospitable (Luke 14, Leviticus 19)

[Notes]
And finally, the love of God is hospitable. Ultimately, the work of creating this world and humans to fill it was an invitation into God’s family. And then God extended His arms of invitation again by dying on the cross so we could be reunited with Him.



Intimacy & Family



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

[Notes]
Okay, but what does the fact that God is in family and enjoy love in that family characterized by those 6 things have to do with us, humans?

Well, because we are created in God’s image, we are made for that kind of love with God and each other
We were made for image-bearing intimacy.





Intimacy & Family



“‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.” (Genesis 1:26-27)

[Notes]
“‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.”
That’s what God said in Genesis 1:26-27 when He created the first humans. We are made in His image. We are imitations, designed to be like God. That’s a big deal, and there’s so much we can learn from that. If we were designed to imitate God, then the nature of God can teach us about ourselves. If we’re unsure what we were made for—what we need—one way to figure that out is by looking at what God values, how He relates to the people around Him. So if God enjoys intimacy in the context of family, maybe we are made for those same things, because we are made in His image.





Intimacy & Family



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

Sexuality – our need for relationship, to know and be known, to give and receive that kind of love

[Notes]
So God enjoys love characterized by diversity, intimacy, giving life, faithfulness, sacrifice, and hospitality.
And we’re made in his image for that same kind of love
So we’re all made for human intimacy complementary, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment, sacrifice, and hospitality

our sexuality is our need for those things
our need to be in relationship
to know and be known
to give and receive love
and because we are mind, body, and spirit, we need connection on cognitive, physical, and spiritual levels

How might these six characteristics impact we find intimacy in the context of family?

Intimacy & Family



We are all created for intimacy in the context of family.

[Notes]
But God didn’t just enjoy intimacy
He enjoyed it in the context of family
And we’re made in His image for that too
We were made for image-bearing family.

we are all created to enjoy this within the context of family. But when I say family, I don’t just mean married people and kids. In Matthew 12:46-50, Jesus subverts our understanding of family, rejecting familial ties based solely on biology and instead establishing that Christian family is bound by the blood of Christ:




Intimacy & Family



“While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, ‘Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.’ But to the one who had told him this, Jesus replied, ‘Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?’ And pointing to his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’” (Matthew 12:46-50)

[Notes]
“While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, ‘Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.’ But to the one who had told him this, Jesus replied, ‘Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?’ And pointing to his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’”
Jesus defines Christian family as a small community of Christians who live life together and embody the gospel for each other. 



Intimacy & Family



We are all created for intimacy in the context of family.

Family – a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other

[Notes]
From the beginning, families made up of God’s children were intended to imitate the love within the Trinity and between God and His people: to bear the image of that love. The love found in families was intended to be intimate, faithful, sacrificial, diverse, live-giving, and hospitable, embodying God’s love in beautiful ways.

We are ALL made for that!

How might this broader definition of family as “a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other” challenge the idolatry of romance in your church?

[Notes]
SL



Intimacy & Family



We don’t need romance, sex, or marriage, and that is good news.

We have emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy needs.


[Notes]
Some caveats or limitations about this intimacy in the context of family:

We don’t need romance, sex, or marriage, and that is good news.
We don’t actually need romance or marriage or sex to meet our needs for intimacy. The Bible never promises marriage or sex to people who follow God, and nowhere does God say we need marriage or sex to be whole, happy people. Yes, we have physical and emotional needs. And yes, romance and sex are one way we can fill those, but not the only ways. Let me explain.

One way to think about our needs for connection is to imagine a set of buckets that need to be filled with water. Each of the buckets represent a kind of intimacy we need. God made us mind, body, and spirit, so we need connection on an emotional level, intellectual level, physical level, and spiritual level.



Intimacy & Family





[Notes]
When I say emotional intimacy, I mean having conversations that help you connect with gladness or fear or anger or sadness inside of you, and where you notice some of those same things in others. When I say spiritual intimacy, I mean connecting in a way that makes you feel more connected to God, by talking about spiritual things, reading Scripture together, or worshipping together. When I say physical intimacy, I mean a hug, holding hands, sitting next to each other on the couch, putting your arm around someone’s shoulder, and yes, kissing and cuddling and sex. When I say intellectual intimacy, I mean exchanging and exploring ideas with another person.
Imagine four buckets, one labeled “emotional,” the second labeled “spiritual,” the third labeled “physical,” and the fourth labeled “intellectual.” Now some would argue that there is a fifth bucket labeled “sexual.” That we all need sexual intimacy to be whole, and if we don’t get it, we will feel empty.
But I know plenty of people who have never had sex and who are full adults. They share with me that they have vibrant social lives, rich intimacy, and a satisfying experience of community. That’s been true in my own life. The healthy emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy I have experienced in friendships has been much more satisfying than the broken physical intimacy I have experienced in the past.

Plus, the Bible doesn’t teach that we need sex or marriage to be whole people. Quite the opposite. Jesus didn’t have sex. Paul was committed to celibacy. Many of the mothers and fathers of the Church have been celibate. And Jesus says that in Heaven, there won’t be any more marriage or sex.



Intimacy & Family



“At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” (Matthew 22:30)

[Notes]
In Matthew 22:30, He says this: “At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” It doesn’t make too much sense that our Savior was celibate or that we will all be celibate in heaven if marriage and sex are necessary to be fully human.
Instead, there are four intimacy buckets. Emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual. God provides a good chunk of our spiritual intimacy. Those who are married will partially fill each of those buckets with the intimacy from their marriage. But, even if you’re married, God and your spouse alone won’t fill your intimacy needs buckets. You will still need emotional intimacy, intellectual intimacy, physical intimacy, and spiritual intimacy from friendship.



Intimacy & Family





[Notes]
And that’s good news!
That’s good news for single people. If either a call from God or circumstances lead you to a life without romance, marriage, or sex, you can still fill your buckets. You can still meet your emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy needs in healthy ways through friendship.
That’s good news for married people. Trying to squeeze all of your intimacy needs out of God and your spouse is a good recipe for divorce. But since you don’t need romance or sex to fill any of your intimacy need buckets, you can meet the rest of your intimacy needs through intimate friendship.

Why do some believe we NEED romance, sex, or marriage?

How might seeing our intimacy needs as buckets to be filled with intimacy with God, friends, and (for some) a spouse change the way we respond to our longings?

[Notes]
SL



Intimacy & Family



None of us will meet our intimacy needs fully and finally in this lifetime.

If we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, the broken parts of our soul and mind tend to reach out for destructive and unsatisfying shortcuts.


[Notes]
None of us will meet our intimacy needs fully and finally in this lifetime. Isaiah 59:2 says that our sins, our imperfection, our unwise choices have separated us from God and each other. Because this world is broken and we are broken, we can only ever connect with God and each other imperfectly. There’s this distance because of brokenness that we can never cross. Some amount of loneliness is a part of life. It is unavoidable.
 
So should we just give up and stop trying to connect in healthy ways? No! For starters, even if we can’t meet all of our needs fully and finally, we can still get a lot of what we need. We can still enjoy rich, satisfying intimacy with God and other people in this life. And second, if we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, the broken parts of our soul and mind tend to reach out for destructive and unsatisfying shortcuts.

Have you noticed that? When you ignore your need for community and connection and try to go at it alone, you end up making unwise decisions later. Lust, objectification, masturbation, pornography, dating apps, meaningless hookups, and adultery all become more difficult to resist. If we try to meet our intimacy needs in those broken ways, we won’t fill our buckets. We just kick them over, and it makes a mess. Instead, we need to actively work to meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways. We need to be intentional about seeking out intimate friendship with others and proactively meet our needs.




Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)
Hospitable (Luke 14, Leviticus 19)

[Notes]
So God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.
And the love we enjoy in that family should point us back to the love in God’s family, should serve as an image of God’s love, should embody the gospel by being complementary, intimate, procreative, faithful, sacrificial, and hospitable

So what does that look like practically?
And how do we do that well?

In short, God has given us two specific ways to do that, he has designed two vocations for stewarding our sexualities in ways that honor Him and point us back to Him: vocational singleness and Christian marriage
Both of these vocations embody those 6 characteristics of the love in God’s family
Both vocations are calls to intimacy in the context of human family



Intimacy & Family



Christian vocation - a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children

[Notes]
Why do I say vocation? Well, A Christian vocation is generally a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision. 

Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom work with undivided attention
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman with an openness to raising children for the kingdom

The practice of vocational singleness and Christian marriage in our churches should be so beautiful that those who do not yet know Jesus want to draw close to them and get to know the Source of that love
When non-believers step into the homes of Christian marriages or vocational singles living together as a family, the love found there should help people believe that God loves them
And they should experience God’s love through those families

That’s why it’s so important for our churches to be places where people are thriving in Christian marriage and vocational singleness—because the gospel depends on it
And that’s why we have to teach accurately about these



Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of temporary singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to a vocation of Christian marriage
Others called to a vocation of singleness for the kingdom

[Notes]
So, how does a Christian know which of these vocations they are called to?
What’s God’s design for each of these vocations?
How do we do them well?

Here’s a summary of how Christians have historically understood the Bible to teach about sexual stewardship
This is the big picture for what it looks like to faithfully, in God-honoring ways, steward our sexualities



Sexual Stewardship

[Notes]
Here’s a representation of those same ideas in a diagram
As we will tease out more later, vocational singleness is distinct from temporary singleness
It is best for everyone to settle down into marriage or vocational singleness, instead of continuing in temporary singleness
Marriage and vocational singleness are equally good callings, but marriage will be more common
There is no default path, one’s calling should be an open-handed question for every Christian

Remember, I’ll tease out all of these claims in the slides to come

How different is this diagram of sexual stewardship from what you learned growing up?

How might seeing oneself called to temporary singleness and assuming neither marriage nor vocational singleness be beneficial?

TEMPORARY SINGLENESS


[Notes]
So what is temporary singleness and how do we do it well?



Temporary Singleness



A period of temporary singleness
Enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ
Called to neither lifelong vocational singleness nor marriage
Submit our sexuality to God, study the Scriptures, discern with God and others

[Notes]
What are we first called to?

We are all first called to a temporary period of abstinent singleness in which we enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ in non-sexual, non-romantic companionship.
We should all learn to do this well
This is a calling to neither vocational singleness nor marriage—defining our default calling in the negative is not sufficient but it is informative—we are not yet called to vocational singleness or to marriage. 
We should not assume that we are called to marriage just because we have sexual desires, want to be a parent, or find abstinent singleness to be too challenging. 
We should all submit our sexuality to God, study what the Scriptures have to say about sexual stewardship, and discern with God and spiritual mentors in our lives whether we are called to vocational singleness or marriage.

As I mentioned earlier, the Church has consistently taught that it is NOT generally God’s intention for Christians to continue in temporary for a lifetime
For the vast majority, it is better to settle down into vocational singleness or marriage
But there are always exceptions to the rule
There will be people whom God calls to leave open the possibility of vocational singleness or marriage in there 30s, 40s, 50s, or perhaps even their entire life
Our churches need to honor and support all those who are faithfully following God’s call

Okay, but why distinguish between temporary singleness and vocational singleness?
And how does one discern between vocational singleness and Christian marriage?








Why should everyone discern?
Matthew 19:11-12 and 1 Corinthians 7 make clear that our relational vocation—marriage or vocational singleness—is called and given, not chosen


Temporary Singleness

[Notes]
I mentioned that everyone should discern this questions of vocational singleness or Christian marriage
That we should all open-handedly offer these possibilities to God and seek His preference
Why?

God calls us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness
the Bible teaches that our vocation is given or called, not chosen
God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us

Where does Scripture teach this?
In Matthew 19, verse 11, in his response to the disciples’ shock about his high standard for marriage, Jesus says that only those to whom the calling of marriage has been given will accept his teachings about marriage. And then in verse 12, Jesus says that only those to whom the calling of vocational singleness has been given will accept his teachings about vocational singleness.
Jesus says that God calls us to either marriage or vocational singleness, and God gives us a gift to thrive in that vocation
Then in 1 Corinthians 7 verse 7, Paul says that he wishes all were like him—all were called to vocational singleness—but God has given each his own gift. God has called some to vocational singleness. God has called others to marriage.

Our preference does not matter
We can share our preference with God, but ultimately we should learn what God’s preference is and ask Him to conform our desires to His desires







A desire to marry, a desire to be a parent, or difficulty being single doesn’t indicate God’s calling.

Each of us has the same inherent capacity for both marriage and vocational singleness. 
Temporary Singleness

[Notes]
now a single person might push back
God has given me a desire to marry
to be a parent
And being single doesn’t come easily to me
I don’t have what it takes to be single for a lifetime
Marriage is natural, but being single for a lifetime is supernatural

By that logic—that a desire to marry, a desire to be a parent, or a difficulty being single tells us we’re called to marriage—the only people who are called to vocational singleness are asexual people.
Clearly that was not Christ’s intention

And marriage and vocational singleness are actually equally natural
Does the average Christian automatically possess everything they need to thrive in vocational singleness? No.
But the same is true of marriage. We don’t have what we need to do marriage well either.
In light of the Fall, romance, sex, and polygamy are natural.
Each of us has the same inherent but incomplete capacity for both vocational singleness and marriage
But to do either well, we must step into that vocation and receive an additional gift to do it well

So we should all discern which God has called us to








5 Ingredients for Wise Discernment
Grow your ”spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Remove any emotional or theological barriers to clear discernment
Consider what kind of work you might be called to
Consider your past and current circumstances
Seek support from your church
Temporary Singleness

[Notes]
so what does it look like to ask God this question
to give God a chance
to discern?

Here’s 5 suggestions

Grow your ”spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Do you know how to bring a question before God, consider Scripture, consider practical aspects of your question, seek advice from spiritual mentors, arrive at a potential conclusion, hold that conclusion before God, seek confirmation through small steps, and move forward with confidence?
Before we ask a question as important as marriage or vocational singleness, let’s practice our skills of discernment on less consequential decisions.
A good book on this is God’s Voice Within

Then, remove any emotional or theological barriers to clear discernment
You need to make sure you have a healthy theological understanding of both vocational singleness and marriage so that you aren’t biased against either
And work through an emotional barriers: fear of marriage because of a family history of divorce or an idolatry of romance

Consider what kind of work you might be called to, and see if that points you toward vocational singleness or marriage
If you feel like the primary work you’ve been called to is to raise children for the Church, then you’re probably called to marriage
Or if you feel called to a mission that might be mutually exclusive with raising children
Like a special mission, a difficult ministry, a life of contemplation or study, or monastic life, then you’re probably called to vocational singleness

Consider your past and current circumstances
Have any experiences from your past pointed you toward one vocation or another?
Or perhaps you find yourself single later in life and ask, “I am still single not by accident, but because God has called me to vocational singleness?”
I’m not saying that every adult who is single later in life has been called to vocational singleness
But perhaps if someone is single later in life, that is a sign of God’s intentions

Seek support from your church in the discernment process. Invite mentors to lead you in this process. Get feedback from friends and family about your discernment. These people can  can often provide better advice with an outside perspective.






VOCATIONAL SINGLENESS







Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.

Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Let’s break down that definition of vocational singleness






“a lifetime calling…”
God calls us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness.
God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us.
God intended for vocational singleness to be committed and permanent.

Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling...
It’s a calling. God eventually calls most of us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness. As we’ll talk more about tomorrow morning in our conversation about discernment, the Bible teaches that our vocation is given or called, not chosen. God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us. And sometimes, God’s preference doesn’t match our preference.  Proverbs 16:9 tells us that our hearts plan our course, but it’s God who directs our path.  And it’s our responsibility to submit to His direction.
Everyone should open-handedly offer this question of vocational singleness or Christian marriage to God, and everyone has the same inherent capacity for both vocations. 
 
But it’s not just a calling. It’s a lifetime calling.
God intends for vocational singleness to be committed and permanent.
- In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus speaks of a call beyond temporary singleness and compares vocational singleness to being a eunuch, a state which is permanent.
- We cannot imagine Jesus providing the 100-fold blessing promised in Luke 18:28-30 to someone who has only temporarily given up the prospect of marriage and children, only to later get married.
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul recognizes and praises committed singleness and teaches that it is better to keep a commitment to vocational singleness than get married.
Then in 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul reaffirms that a commitment to vocational singleness is good and to break that commitment is a sin.

“a lifetime calling to singleness…”
A call to give up romance, dating, marriage, and sex
Still a call to intimacy in the context of committed family
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness...
Vocational singleness is a call to give up romance, dating, marriage, sex, and children, but that doesn’t mean that a person is called to loneliness.

In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus talks about vocational singleness as a giving up of romance, marriage, sex, and children.
And then in Luke 18:28-30, Jesus promises a 100-fold of brothers, sisters, and children now in this present time to those who give up the potential for a spouse and children for the sake of the kingdom.
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul confirms that vocational singleness involves giving up sex, romance, marriage, and children but recognizes that those called to vocational singleness still need committed companionship.

Vocational singleness is still a call to intimacy in the context of committed family.
In Isaiah 56:3-5, the celibate is promised family, belonging, and honor equal to the married person, that they will be full and equal members of the family of God, that they will be spiritual parents in ways just as great as biological parents.
Then in 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul recognizes early families of celibate people by commending a committed community of celibate women.

Now that we know what vocational singleness is, now let’s explore why God calls some people to this lifetime vocation of singleness.






Stay with biological family
Join another nuclear family
Create families of vocationally single people
Family in Singleness

[Notes]
But how can vocational singleness find intimacy in the context of permanent, lived-in human family?
Here’s 3 ways:

First, we can encourage people to stay deeply connected to their biological family. This might look like living with a parent, a sibling, or a cousin, doing rhythms of family with those people, and committing to helping them raise the children in that household.

Or, you might help single people knit themselves into unrelated nuclear families in your church. Maybe people go out of their way to choose celibate people as godparents for their children. Or you invite single people to weekly dinner with your family. Or include them in holidays and vacations. You could even invite single people to live in your home, commit to your family, and help you raise your kids.

Or third, you can help celibate people create families of their own
Help celibate people gather together and commit to being family for each other and doing rhythms of family together.
This is perhaps the least conventional of the options suggested here, and while it might be the most beautiful, it also involved the most logistics.
Churches can help support celibate people in creating these intentional Christian communities by suggesting the idea, helping them cast vision for it, providing pastoral support while they explore the possibility, coaching them through the process, and maybe even providing financial support in the early years.
For example, a group of 5 guys and I in Nashville are discerning whether God has called us to start an intentional Christian community for men committed to vocational singleness where we would make commitments to do life together for the rest of our lives. This are the kind of solutions the Church needs

Regardless of which path they take, they need intimate, committed, and permanent family just like everyone else
You’ve noticed that each solution involves living together and commitment
We need to help celibate people find that
Because it is particularly hard for celibate people to find that
And the paths are often unconventional

What’s lacking in the evidence from Scripture and the early Church that the singleness Jesus and Paul spoke of was intended to be permanent?

How might a permanent giving up of romance and dating free those called to vocational singleness to focus on kingdom work and their spiritual family?

“a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom”
Do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time and energy to do
Embody the gospel in unique ways
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Why does God call some to Vocational Singleness?
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.
Jesus uses the phrase “for the sake of the kingdom” in Matthew 19:1-12 and Luke 18:28-30 to describe vocational singleness. Those called to vocational singleness live “for the sake of the kingdom” in three ways:
First, God intended for those in vocational singleness to use their availability, primarily from not raising children, to do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time, energy, or financial freedom to do. In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus invites his disciples to consider giving up the potential for spouse and children in order to live “like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom,” referring to Old Testament eunuchs who commonly worked for a king, managing and building up the king’s kingdom. In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul explains that vocational singleness involves giving up a spouse and children to be more concerned with the work of the Church. In 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul commends faithful members of the community of celibate women who have fully committed themselves to the Lord.

Second, Vocational singleness is for the sake of the kingdom because it embodies the gospel. Similarly to marriage, vocational singleness is an image of the love found in God’s family (the Trinity and between Christ and the Church), preaching the gospel by reflecting that love. Vocational singleness is spiritually procreative, sacrificial, committed, intimate, and hospitable, pointing those who see that image back to the original source: God’s love.






Diverse – differentness of personalities, sexes, ages
Intimate – still a call to family, fullness of God’s love in NHNE
Faithful – permanent and lifetime, consistent kingdom work
Vocational singleness is…
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Now, let’s look at the ways singleness for the sake of the kingdom embodies those six characteristics of love found in the Trinity and between Christ and His Church.


1. Vocational singleness is diverse. The friendships enjoyed by those committed to vocational singleness reflect the diversity in God’s family. There is a differentness between the persons in each friendship. Plus, vocational singles still need healthy relationships with people of the opposite sex, parents, and children. Vocational singleness is still a call to a diversity of friendships with people of all ages and stages of life. This differentness points observers back to the complementarity in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church as well as the unity found in the body of Christ even amidst differences.

2. Vocational singleness is intimate. As already mentioned, vocational singleness is still a call to intimacy in the context of family. Jesus and Paul recognize vocational singles’ need for committed companionship and promise a 100-fold of family in this lifetime. This intimacy points observers back to the intimacy in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church. The family vocational singles enjoy testifies to the fullness of God’s love and gives every Christian hope for how we will all live in the New Heavens and New Earth.

3. Vocational singleness is faithful. The permanent, lifetime nature of a commitment to vocational singleness reflects the faithfulness of God’s love found in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church. Through this vocation, those called faithfully live out their singleness for the Lord consistently build up the kingdom in ways that point back to the faithfulness of the love in God’s family.







Life-giving – spiritually procreative and more kingdom work
Sacrificial – give up idol of romance to follow Jesus
Hospitable – offer family to lonely
Vocational singleness is…
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
4. Vocational singleness is life-giving. While those called to vocational singleness do not bear biological children, their availability for kingdom works should bear the fruit of many times more spiritual children. The vocationally single have the time and energy to share the gospel with more not-yet-believers and mentor more new Christians than parents can. Plus, those called to vocational singleness reflect the procreative nature of God’s love by building up the kingdom and bringing spiritual life to the Church.

5. Vocational singleness is sacrificial. At first glance, those called to vocational singleness have chosen to give up their right to some of our culture’s most coveted experiences: romance, dating, marriage, and sex. The sacrifice of vocational singles points observers back to the sacrificial nature of the love in God’s family.

6. Vocational singleness is hospitable. Those called to vocational singleness have the unique opportunity to offer family to those on the margins without the need to compete for belonging. This hospitality reflects the welcoming nature of the love in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church.






“a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom”
Do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time and energy to do
Embody the gospel in unique ways
Give every Christian hope for the New Heavens and New Earth 
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
And Third, Vocational singleness is for the sake of the kingdom because it gives every Christian hope for the New Heavens and New Earth. In Luke 20:34-36, Jesus teaches that all will be celibate in the New Heaven and New Earth. So vocational singleness preaches the gospel in way that marriage does not by serving as a physical sign and hope for how we will all live in the NHNE. 

Contemporaries of early Christians saw marriage as a necessity to secure physical protection, wealth, and a legacy through descendants. So when Christians called to vocational singleness fulfilled the promises in Isaiah 56:3-5 and Luke 18:29 by experiencing more family, more belonging, and more honor than married people, they provided Christians with a preview of and hope for a New Heavens and New Earth where God would keep us safe, provide everything we needed, and would never forget us. 

But today, westerners seem interested in romance and marriage because they promise a way to find faithful love and escape loneliness. So modern Christian vocational singleness can uniquely testify to the fullness of God’s love by previewing a time when we don’t have to compete—to be more attractive or intelligent or funny than others—in order to be loved by others and belong in a family. Christians today should look at those in vocational singleness, see them enjoying intimate community without the need for romance, exclusivity, or competing for each others’ affection; and that preview should give every Christian hope for the fullness of God’s love in the kingdom to come.
