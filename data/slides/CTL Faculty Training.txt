SERVING

LGBT+ STUDENTS




[Notes]
Pieter Valk
Executive Director of EQUIP
mission

This work matters to me because this is a part of my story
experiencing same-sex attraction and reconciling that with my Christian faith and traditional beliefs
found a Christian community in college that was a safe space for me to share my story, invite my friends into my life, and ask the big questions
I came to the conclusion that romantic or sexual relationships with other guys wasn’t for me
And I committed my life to serving men and women like me who experience same-sex attraction

And we’ve been working here at Lipscomb training the Student Life Team, Resident Assistants, University Counseling Center Staff, Faculty, and Student Leaders
all so LGBT+ students at Lipscomb can find that same Christian community I found where they can share their story, invite their friends into that part of their life, and navigate the big questions

student surveys have shown that faculty are one of the first people associated with Lipscomb University that students are likely to share about their sexuality







Our goal.
Explore principles and skills for ministering to LGBT+ students

Learn about resources available to LGBT+ students

terms



Most importantly.
You DO NOT have to be their pastor or counselor.

Only be
What a student asks you to be
What you feel comfortable being, AND
What you feel competent to be






Ineffective ministry.






Behave
Believe
Belong

[Notes]
for a long time, we were taught that to be a good Christian, you had to do three things in a certain order
first, we were told we had to behave
follow the rules
look like a good Christian
stop doing the bad things
then, once we looked on the outside like we were supposed to, we could start to believe
to believe in who Jesus was and what he did
go get to know our God through the Scriptures
and only then, after we looked like a Christian and we believed the right things, could we belong
were we told: you’re one of us
were we fully loved

the problem with this model is, it doesn’t work
I am sure you can each come up with a lot of reasons, but one good one is that this wasn’t the way Jesus did it



A better strategy.






Believe
Belong
Become
4

[Notes]
instead, the example we have in Scripture is Christ first inviting us to belong to the family
to be a part of
to find family
then, we are invited to discover and believe what is true
and finally, as we believe what is true, we are motivated from the inside out to become who Christ has called us to be

today, we’re going to learn how to love LGBT+ students better through these lens
how can we come alongside LGBT+ students as they belong, believe, and become



BELONG


[Notes]
first, before LGBT+ students will believe or become who Christ has called them to be, we have to invite them to belong
to be a part of our communities of faith



A place to BELONG.
Find acceptance and unconditional love
Talk about their experiences without shame
Find meaningful, intimate community
Share meals and sadness and celebration with us
Work out their faith alongside us




Belong

[Notes]
What does it look like to be a place where LGBT+ students can belong?



Suggestions.




Belong
Create safe spaces to share

Show compassion and respect

Trust the Holy Spirit
7

[Notes]
create safe space to share
because you have students that experience same-sex attraction but you don’t know about because they aren’t yet sure if you’re safe
invite to share 
to share stories without ultimatums 
use sensitive language 
demonstrate compassion and respect 
recognize sins of the Church 
motivated by desire for the best things 
respect right to choose (you can’t control their choice anyway) 
trust holy spirit (patience) 
rarely are people argued into being a Christian or surrendering part of their life to Christ 
the Holy Spirit does that 
don’t try to do the Holy Spirit’s job, take responsibility for failure, take credit for success 
our part is to seek God shoulder to shoulder with others, encouraging them in their journey 
trust and be patient with the Holy Spirit to reveal what is true to sexual minorities
to challenge them to surrender on own time 
be ready for decades of loving 
goal is not success but faithfulness/obedience

How can you put these suggestions into action to better invite sexual minorities to belong?

Believe
Belong

[Notes]
After people belong, once they get a taste of what is good and see glimpses of Christ in Christians,
they will start to explore and believe in who Christ was and what he did



BELIEVE


[Notes]
and we can come alongside LGBT+ students as they begin to believe
must offer a consistent, complex, and meaningful theology of intimacy and sexuality



What do I believe?



Experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin.

Homosexual activity is a sin.

No promise of change in SSA.

We do not choose who we are attracted to but we choose how we respond.

Believe

[Notes]
I’ll start by sharing with you what I believe, and I want to do this for a couple of reasons
first, while I’m not a professor or campus minister at Lipscomb and I can’t speak for Lipscomb
these beliefs are shared by leadership here at Lipscomb
and so I encourage you to consider these beliefs
because we think they’re good ones
for those of you that believe similarly to me, these might put into words things you’ve been thinking
and for those of you who disagree, I encourage you to dialogue with the ideas and at least consider them



What do I believe?



Any sin can separate us from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all.

God promises transformation of the heart and provision of fullness to anyone who seeks Him faithfully.

Believe



What do I believe?



God calls the Church to love those who experience SSA regardless of what their journeys look like.

God loves LGBT+ people and He values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ.

Believe



And why?



Preponderance of Biblical support

Same-sex sexual activity is sin

Marriage defined between man and women

Context of rape, incest, adultery, or sex outside of marriage

Written for a people in a time and place

Believe

[Notes]
Next I want to share with you why I believe what I believe
and again, the leadership at Lipscomb come from a similar place
specifically on the question of whether homosexual activity is a sin

first, lets start with the bible



And why?



Created for perfect intimacy with God and the Body of Christ

Intimacy needs are good and normal

Neither sex nor marriage are promised or necessary to meet intimacy needs

Believe

[Notes]
but we can go deeper than just the handful of verses that talk about homosexuality
there are foundational truths about how God created us as relational beings that can help us answer this question
but you’ll quickly see that the reason we haven’t made arguments from these foundational truths is that few Christian really believe them and live them out

define intimacy needs
God creates Eve, Jesus when tempted and in garden, in Heaven
if we don’t meet in healthy ways or will meet in unhealthy ways

so for the sexual minority, yes, you were created for intimacy, but no one is promised or needs sex or marriage to meet their intimacy needs

even here we start to see some things that aren’t reflected in the Church
we don’t know how to meet needs outside of marriage or sex
and straight people don’t do this, so why should sexual minorities?




And why?



The Blessing of Singleness (really)

Every person is first called to singleness

Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges

Believe

[Notes]
benefits of singleness
and regardless of whether marriage later, all people should learn to do this well first

few churches teach these things
Church lift marriage on a pedestal and fail to provide support for single people to do singleness well



And why?



The Uniqueness of Christian Marriage

One man and one woman before God

Reflection of intimacy and complementarity in trinity

Centrality of child-rearing
Responsibility and commitment

Believe

[Notes]
many called out of singleness into marriage
vocation to raise children for kingdom

it’s not that we’re saying we don’t want gay people to be happy
its just that Christian marriage has been uniquely reserved for a specific purpose

instead what we often hear in the church is that every has a right to be married and the purpose of marriage is to make you happy



Conclusions



All are called to steward sexuality in inconvenient ways

All can meet their intimacy needs in singleness

Believe

[Notes]
why are these foundational beliefs important? how do they inform how we think about homosexual activity?

or at least as much as anyone’s intimacy needs can be met in a broken world

the invitation to those who experience same-sex attraction is no less good and the challenges are no more great



But instead…



All are promised marriage 

We can’t meet our intimacy needs as single people 

Marriage is about being happy and we don’t need permission

Believe
22

[Notes]
so we shouldn’t be surprised that no one takes us seriously
that leaves us with a challenge as a church to foster a community where people can meet their intimacy needs as single people and teach accurately about marriage





Share.
How do you think LGBT+ students would respond to this theology of intimacy and sexuality?

Does this system of belief fit for you?




Believe
29



A better strategy.






Believe
Belong
Become

[Notes]
once they belong, they experience and see goodness, they want to believe 
and incrementally as they believe, Christ asks them to make him the Lord of that area of their life, surrendering to him those parts of their live and become who Christ made them to be
