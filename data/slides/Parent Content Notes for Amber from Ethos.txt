What NOT to Say 
Limit conversation about sexuality to demonizing gay sex and people
Ignore opportunities for conversation because you feel uncomfortable or ill-equipped
Neglect from educating yourself about the topic
Let your children see your negative reactions
Entirely pass the responsibility of ministry off to someone else






[Notes]
all I heard from family and church was God is against homosexuality
when gay people came on TV, my parents said very derogatory things
had no reason to believe either would respond well
never talked about being Christian and having SSA
thought it was my fault and I wasn’t praying hard enough
when caught me watching gay porn, didn’t talk to me about it being gay because didn’t want to believe I was gay
when an incident came up with another guy, blamed in on the other guy being gay and still didnt want to believe I was gay
ignored the conversation and waited for me to bring it up
didn’t seek out resources for themselves
showed me their mourning and confusion
shipped me off to a therapist
talked about fighting it and becoming straight and wanting grandkids

instead
talk about it before you have any reason to believe they might be gay
normalize same-sex attractions and celibacy
clarify important theological ideas (cause, choice, chance, brokenness, future possibilities, shame)
recognize that there are faithful Christians who continue to experience SSA
don’t run away from the conversation and initiate
grieve, process, and learn on your own—seek out counseling without son
give time to make sense of this for themselves—call them to certain standard and share hope they land there on their own and help them get there




Sharing with Teens
Today we had a conversation about sexuality and how we as Christians can steward our sexualities in God-honoring ways. In particular, we talked about same-sex attraction: when a boy likes another boy or a girl likes another girl. I want you to know that we are all broken—none of us are how God intended us to be. If one day you realize that you are attracted to other boys/girls like you, I want you to know…
You don’t choose who you are attracted to
You’re not alone and you don’t have to make sense of this alone
You don’t need to feel ashamed—it’s not your fault
God doesn’t love you any less and He has great plans for you
I’m not going to try to make you straight
Please let me in and let me walk through that with you.




[Notes]
Josh:

circle of truth
sharing story in age-appropriate ways
conversations happen at inconvenient times
never promote shame




Navigating Differences



Ask to submit decisions to traditional sexual ethic (for now)

Patiently walk with your teen as the Holy Spirit reveals why that ethic is good, beautiful, and true



Created for Love



We are all created for family in the Body of Christ (Genesis 2, Leviticus 26:12) 

Family – a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other

Neither sex nor marriage is promised or necessary to meet our intimacy needs



Final Take-Aways
Keep learning yourself
Open the door for conversation with your teens
Trust God






Scenario 1
They give you some reason to think they might be gay (gay porn, texting conversation with same-sex friend that seems romantic, admitting gay to someone else, another friend or parent tells you, LGBT media, asking lots of questions about what you believe about LGBT stuff, etc.)

don’t ignore
don’t assume
share with them what you know, what that might mean
what you think about all of this
and invite them to talk about it



Scenario 2
Your teen comes out to you as gay and believes God blesses same-sex marriages




[Notes]
come out to you as gay and believe God blesses same-sex marriages
assure them of your love
share what you believe
but say before you get into all of that, want to hear their story, pains, fears, and hopes from the past that has been unshared
ask them questions about what they believe and why—get more info



Scenario 3
Your teen comes out to you as gay and wants help with the attraction and do not believe same-sex marriage is God’s intention.




[Notes]
come out to you as gay but want help with attractions and don’t believe SSM is God’s intention
assure them of your love
share what you believe
but say before you get into all of that, want to hear their story, pains, fears, and hopes from the past that has been unshared
ask them questions about what they believe and why—get more info
