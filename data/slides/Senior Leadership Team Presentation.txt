[Notes]
Introduce myself
grad student
meet with clients
more importantly, EQUIP Nashville (mission)
my story (found safe, vulnerable Christian community in college where I could make sense of my questions)

I care deeply about whether the next generation of Christian Leaders are prepared to address the questions of our time with courage, compassion, and conviction

I believe that you wouldn’t be here if you didn’t share the same commitment to preparing students here at Lipscomb for the same
you don’t have to be a bible and theology major or be a pastor to do the work of the Church—every one of our student has the potential to lead in their communities
Why we’re here
Clarify Campus Vision
Explore Partnership Opportunities


[Notes]
so why are we here today?
broadly, to talk about how we can better prepare students at Lipscomb to be leaders in their congregations regarding the LGBT+ community

more specifically, I hope we can clarify our shared vision for this campus on this topic and explore partnership opportunities to give those you influence what they need to prepare and empower students
The Need
Secular worldview
Polarization of theology
Sexual minorities overwhelmed or barely hanging on 


[Notes]
Before we can talk about what we ought to do, we first have to clarify: what is the need?
External pressures to conform to a secular worldview
Many students at the extremes of either abandoning orthodoxy and adopting a gay-affirming theology or speaking truth without love
Individuals who experience ssa: some have believed the lies that if they just follow their hearts desires they will be happy while others are still fighting alone, wondering how much longer they can last
Lipscomb’s Commitment
Present robust theology
Train campus leaders to minister
Invite sexual minorities into safe places


[Notes]
Senior Leadership made a commitment before the school year began to meet this need 
Present a robust theology about sexuality to the student body so that they would be convicted about what is true while still being able to communicate with humility and compassion (campus and community)
Equip campus leaders to minister to those in the lifestyle (student, faculty, staff)
Invite those struggling with same-sex attraction out of a place of secrecy and shame to fight the good fight in the light alongside their brothers and sisters in christ

But how?
Student Life Team partnered with EQUIP Nashville
7 out of 10 felt comfortable being a friend
5 out of 10 felt comfortable ministering
100% felt unprepared to talk about the morality of homosexuality, gay marriage, gay persons in church leadership, etc.  


[Notes]
How do we do this? How do we act on this commitment?
The Student Life Team and EQUIP Nashville partnered together to meet this commitment
we explored the unique needs of the Student Life Team
when we first surveyed, we found that…

there’s a good chance that these same numbers are true of the colleagues you work with on campus

[Notes]
So together, we designed a training to fulfill the Student Life Team’s desire to have the understanding and skills to better love and minister to sexual minority students

today I wanted to give you a glimpse of what something life this could look for for each of your areas of campus by sharing some snippets from that training

What do you believe?
Experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin
Homosexual activity is a sin
No promise of change in SSA
We do not choose who we are attracted to but we choose how we respond
Any sin can separate of from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all


[Notes]
helpful to know what we believe and why we believe it
difficult to love and serve others with an unsteady foundation

we explored some possible beliefs and the topic and discussed what fit, what didn’t, and why
What do you believe?
God promises transformation of the heart and provision of fullness to anyone who seeks Him faithfully
God calls the Church to love those who experience SSA regardless of what their journeys look like
God loves LGBT people and He values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ


Why we believe it
Preponderance of Biblical Support
Tradition
Study of Psychology
Natural Law
Broader Theological Themes

[Notes]
but we know that between knowing what we believe and why we believe it, the second is the more challenging
so we explored some different reasons people hold a traditional sexual ethic on the question: is homosexual activity a sin?

[Notes]
the one I’d like to share a little bit more about today is this final category: Broad Theological Themes
Broader Themes
Created for perfect intimacy with God and the Body of Christ
Intimacy needs normal and good
Neither marriage nor sex promised or necessary to meet needs

[Notes]
how we answer the question of the morality of homosexual activity is rooted in deeper, foundational truths

must meet in healthy ways or will meet in unhealthy ways
God creates Eve, Jesus when tempted and in garden, in Heaven

even hear we start to see some things that aren’t reflected in the Church
we don’t know how to meet needs outside of marriage or sex

Broader Themes
The Blessing of Singleness (really)
Every person is first called to singleness
Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges

[Notes]
benefits of singleness
and regardless of whether marriage later, all people should learn to do this well first
disadvantages of marriage?

few churches teach these things
Church discourages singleness and makes it very hard for people to do so


Broader Themes
The Uniqueness of Christian Marriage
One man and one woman before God
Reflection of intimacy and complementarity in trinity
Centrality of procreation
Responsibility and commitment

[Notes]
called out of singleness into marriage
vocation to raise children for kingdom

instead what we often hear in the church is that every has a right to be married and the purpose of marriage is to make you happy

why are these foundational beliefs important? how do they inform how we think about homosexual activity?
shows that all called to steward sexuality in inconvenient ways
All can meet their intimacy needs in singleness
perhaps options seem slim for those who experience same-sex attraction because single people can’t meet their intimacy needs in the Church and Christians spread lie that marriage and sex promised and necessary

that leaves us with a challenge as a church to foster a community where people can meet their intimacy needs as single people and teach accurately about marriage
Why we believe it
…people don’t care

Does the Church offer something better?
What we really offer
Lie that people need and are promised marriage
Singling out gays while ignoring divorce/adultery
Church culture of silence and fear of subject
Nearly impossible to live out singleness
Spiritual friendship nonexistent
What we should offer
Accurate theology about marriage
Nondiscriminatory application of Scripture
Shame-free church to talk about experience
Robust culture of singleness
Spiritual friendship to meet intimacy needs

[Notes]
the last part of the training I want to give you a little preview of was our efforts to equip campus leaders to minister to sexual minorities
LGBT+ Persons
Be compassionate
Respect their right to choose
Minister to core wounds
Trust the Holy Spirit


[Notes]
first, we talked about our posture to all sexual and gender minorities, but particularly those that identify as LGBT+

be compassionate 
     recognize sins of the Church 
     motivated by desire for the best things 
respect right to choose 
     you can’t control their choice anyway 
     just want them to be honest with themselves 
minister to core wounds 
trust the HS 
     obedience, not results 

Ministering: Core Q’s
Will you treat me differently now that you know?
Why and how did God let this happen?
How do I refrain from behavior?
What do I do with all of this shame?
Where do I find my identity? Where do I belong?
How do I meet my intimacy needs?
What can I expect in the future?




[Notes]
And then when we explored how to minister to sexual and gender minorities, we concentrated on 7 core questions people who experience same-sex attraction are asking
leading those you are ministering to along the question can be your roadmap for ministering, or you can be prepared to address these questions as the individual brings them up
but the focus was not to provide campus leaders with all of the answer but to prepare them to help those they minister to think well about these questions
