HEAR A STORY


[Notes]
empathize with sexual minorities
see impact of family, church, and society
imagine a participant with this story

Pain and redemption
Not over
Very common





Questions to Consider
What aspects of the story have participants shared in the past?
What significant events/relationships contributed to the development of SSA
How did the Church fail to respond (both parents and pastors)?
Can you imagine having had a participant in the past with this same story but afraid to share?

THEOLOGY


[Notes]
know what you believe and why
so that you can have informed conversations with participants



My Beliefs



Experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin.

Homosexual activity is a sin.

No promise of change in SSA.

We do not choose who we are attracted to but we choose how we respond.

[Notes]
what I believe
shared by Lipscomb
they’re good ones
similar
different



My Beliefs



Any sin can separate us from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all.

God promises transformation of the heart and provision of fullness to anyone who seeks Him faithfully.



My Beliefs



God calls the Church to love those who experience SSA regardless of what their journeys look like.

God loves LGBT+ people and He values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ.

Would you feel comfortable sharing your beliefs with participants?

What have the ranges of beliefs been among your participants?



51



Why?



Preponderance of Biblical support

Same-sex sexual activity is sin

Marriage defined between man and women

Context of rape, incest, adultery, or sex outside of marriage

Written for a people in a time and place



Why?



Created for perfect intimacy with God and the Body of Christ

Intimacy needs are good and normal

Neither sex nor marriage are promised or necessary to meet intimacy needs

[Notes]
deeper, foundational truths about how God created us as relational beings
you’ll see how we don’t really believe these or act upon them

define intimacy needs
God creates Eve, Jesus when tempted and in garden, in Heaven
if we don’t meet in healthy ways or will meet in unhealthy ways

so for the sexual minority, yes, you were created for intimacy, but no one is promised or needs sex or marriage to meet their intimacy needs

but we don’t know how to meet needs outside of marriage or sex
and straight people don’t do this, so why should sexual minorities?




Why?



The Blessing of Singleness (really)

Every person is first called to singleness

Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges

[Notes]
regardless of whether marriage later, all people should learn to do this well first

few churches teach these things
Church lift marriage on a pedestal and fail to provide support for single people to do singleness well



Why?



The Uniqueness of Christian Marriage

One man and one woman before God

Reflection of intimacy and complementarity in trinity

Centrality of child-rearing
Responsibility and commitment

[Notes]
many called out of singleness into marriage

it’s not that we’re saying we don’t want gay people to be happy
its just that Christian marriage has been uniquely reserved for a specific purpose

instead what we often hear in the church is that every has a right to be married and the purpose of marriage is to make you happy



Why?



All are called to steward sexuality in inconvenient ways

All can meet their intimacy needs in singleness

[Notes]
the invitation to those who experience same-sex attraction is no less good and the challenges are no more great



Why?



Instead…

All are promised marriage 

We can’t meet our intimacy needs as single people 

Marriage is about being happy and we don’t need permission

[Notes]
so we shouldn’t be surprised that no one takes us seriously
that leaves us with a challenge as a church to foster a community where people can meet their intimacy needs as single people and teach accurately about marriage





So what?
People don’t care what we believe or why we believe it.

They care whether we are offering something better.






So what?
Offer something better




[Notes]
if we really want to convince people—if we want them to believe and become—we have to offer something better—it’s on us



Be the Church.



Accurate theology about marriage

Nondiscriminatory application of Scripture

Shame-free church to talk about experience

Robust culture of singleness

Spiritual friendship to meet intimacy needs



Share
Could the community found among team members be a shame-free place for sexual minorities to share their story?
Could that community be a place for meaningful, healthy friendships?
How can you as staff foster that?

PRACTICE


[Notes]
case-by-case
commonly anticipated scenarios



Case 1
While on your trip, a participant shares, “I feel like I know you guys better than most people and I trust you. I want you to know that I’m gay. I know what the Bible says, but I strongly believe that if I got married to another Christian man, God would bless it.” Later, another participant shares the he isn’t comfortable sleeping in the same room as someone who is gay or being in the same public shower.




[Notes]
take 2 minutes to reflect on your own
1) what do you see as most challenging?
2) what would you do?



Case 2
Your team is enjoying the local culture in a cafe downtown when a flamboyant LGBT festival begins and builds in intensity. You see some participants quietly talking to each other and hear one snicker, “Look at those fags."






Case 3
A person shares during team building that a sibling recently came out as lesbian and that it devastated the family. “She brought her girlfriend to the house and just told my parents and told them that if they wanted her in their life, they needed to accept that she was gay and love her girlfriend. It made me so angry. She can’t talk to mom and dad like that. I know people don’t choose who they’re attracted to, but being in a relationship with another girl is still wrong.” Another student interjects, defending a gay-affirming theology passionately. You look around and see one particular student with great fear in her eyes, and you suspect it is because she also experiences same-sex attraction.






Case 4
During application interviews, you notice that the gentleman dresses in more gender-neutral ways, displays more feminine mannerisms, and speaks with a more feminine inflection. He never states that he is gay and you never ask, but you know the host partner for the trip he is applying might be uncomfortable with the student’s presentation.






Case 5
During sharing time in the middle of service week, a participant shares tearfully, “I have never felt better loved than by this group. I want to tell you something that I rarely tell people. I have been hurt in the past but I think I can trust this group. I experience same-sex attraction, and I hate it. I don't want to be gay or be in relationship with another guy and trying to figure all of that out alone has been painful and lonely. And to be honest, I am afraid for our trip to be over and all of us going back to pretending like we don’t know each other in a month—I don’t know if I can do this alone anymore."






Case 6
Two months before your trip is scheduled, a team member shares with you that two of the girls on the trip are lesbians, and not only that, but they are dating. You are reminded that the sleeping arrangements for this trip have all of the girls sleeping in fairly close proximity in a single room, and it has not been uncommon in the past for women to huddle together while sleeping as nights can get chilly.
