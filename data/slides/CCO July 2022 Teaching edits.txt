FOR GAY PEOPLE

[Notes]
Thanks for the opportunity to dive into this conversation with all of you






Love & Wisdom



What is God’s wisdom for everyone’s sexual stewardship?
What does that wisdom mean for sexual minority students?
How can we respond when students share about their sexuality?

[Notes]
This afternoon we’re going to explore how can we offer God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship to all students
What that means for sexual minority students
And how we can respond effectively and compassionately when a student shares about their sexual orientation with you


Pieter Valk of

[Notes]
But first, a little about me
my name is Pieter Valk
I’m a writer and speaker about discernment, vocational singleness, & LGBT+ topics according to a traditional sexual ethic
I’ve been published in places like Christianity Today
and taught at over 65 churches, Christian universities, and campus ministries
 
I’m the founder and executive Director of Equip—a premier consulting & training solution for churches aspiring to be places where gay people thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic
We’ve trained over 11,000 Christian leaders
 
I’m a teacher and aspiring deacon in the Anglican Church in North America about celibacy and sexuality
 
I’m a founding brother of the Nashville Family of Brothers, an ecumenically Christian monastery building family for men called to vocational singleness
 
And I’m a licensed professional counselor specialized in serving gay Christians hoping to steward their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic
 
I graduated with Highest Honors in Chemistry from Vanderbilt University, studied at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and earned a Master's in Clinical Mental Health Counseling at Lipscomb University
 
each of my jobs has to do with sexuality and finding belonging in the body of Christ
this work matters to me
because I’m a Christian
I’m gay
and I am committed to a traditional sexual ethic
What do I mean when I say “a traditional sexual ethic”?
a belief that God’s best for every Christian is either vocational singleness (a lifetime vocation of abstinent singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention)
or a lifetime vocation of opposite-sex marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom
We’ll get into how that applies to gay people with more nuance later, but in short I believe that…

There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses
Same-sex sexual/romantic activity is sinful
Being gay is a result of the Fall. God did not intend for me to be gay.
Being gay is a brokenness, but it is not a sin.
We do not choose who we are attracted to, but we choose how we respond.
A mix of nature and nurture contribute to the development of sexual orientation.
There is no proven formula for changes a persons’ attractions.
God offers LGBT+ Christians the same options as everyone else: vocational singleness or opposite-sex Christian marriage
And our churches and Christian communities need to do a MUCH better job of becoming places where gay people could take hold of these and thrive with reasonable effort

I also want to make a quick note about terminology.
I’m going to use the word “gay” most frequently today as a general, catch-all term for people who are attracted to people of the same sex.
I don’t use that word to communicate anything about people’s theological beliefs or what kind of relationships they are seeking out.
It only means “boys who like boys” or “girls who like girls”.
And I’ll use the phrase “gay Christian” to refer to people who are Christians and experience same-sex attraction.
I use that phrase to describe myself because that’s the term that I’m most comfortable with.
But not everyone uses that phrase, and Christians I respect prefer to use different language.
There is healthy discussion Christians can have about that disagreement.
For now, I’ll use the word gay as I’ve defined it here.



SEXUAL
STEWARDSHIP

FOR ALL




[Notes]
So, first, how can we offer God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship to all students?



Stewardship for All



How has God created us for intimacy in the context of family?
What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?
What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?
What is Christian marriage, and why does God’s wisdom matter?

[Notes]
Here’s the key questions we’ll explore in this section…

How has God created us for intimacy in the context of family?
What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?
What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?
What is Christian marriage, and why does God’s wisdom matter?

I also want to note how I think this content will be helpful:
First, it will deepen your understanding and confidence
Second, it will model nuanced conversation with students
With the hopes that THIRD, deeper understanding will inform actions you take as staff individually and collectively
And Fourth, that continued rumination on this content after this training will equip you to apply these concepts in conversation with a diversity of students




INTIMACY & FAMILY


[Notes]
first we’re going to start with the foundation
How has God created each of us for intimacy in the context of family, regardless of sexual orientation?

Why start here?
When we attempt to talk to teens and young adults about sex, dating, intimacy, and family, we typically focus on urging them to refrain from sexual activity. 
But by focusing only on dating, sex, and marriage when we try to communicate a biblical sexual ethic, we admit that the best things in life are sex and marriage.
To those who will never marry or have sex (for whatever reason), we mislead them into believing that their calling is lesser.
And to those who will marry, and have sex, we set false expectations that marriage and sex will end loneliness and fulfill them completely.
Plus, a focus on dating, marriage, and sex communicates to gay people that if they obey God’s teachings, they are likely to miss out on the best things that God has to offer. 

When we focus only on sex and marriage, the Church suffers, too:
very few people submit to the calling of singleness in order to serve God with undivided attention,
more Christians fall into pornography usage (somewhere around 10% of Christian women and 64% of Christian men view pornography at least monthly https://www.provenmen.org/pornography-survey-statistics-2014/),
divorce rates soar when the fulfillment we were promised doesn’t come (among those who attend church regularly,
about 38% have been divorced https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/factchecker-divorce-rate-among-christians/#_ftn1),
and 54% of gay people who grow up in the Church end up leaving the faith (Us versus Us by Andrew Marin).
We must offer something better.

We need to zoom out to include more of the possibilities God has for us and frame the conversation around the right questions:
How has God created all of us for intimacy with God and other humans?
What are the best ways for every person to enjoy human intimacy in the context of family?
How are all of us called to submit to God our capacities for romance and sex?
How can all of us enjoy deep relationship in committed community, regardless of whether we’re called to committed singleness or Christian marriage?
To answer those questions, to figure out what we’re made for, maybe we should start by looking at our Creator. At God.





Intimacy & Family



God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.

God is a being who enjoys intimacy in the context of family, and He created us in His image for those same things.

[Notes]
God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.

How do we know that? Because God is a being who enjoys intimacy in the context of family, and He created us in His image for those same things.
 
God put Himself in families. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit make up a family called the Trinity.
And the Trinity created this world, made man, gave us choice, and sent His son to live a perfect life and die on the cross for our sins so that we could be a part of His family.
The Bible goes even further to establish that God is in family and He invites us into that family by calling us, the group of people who follow Jesus, Christ’s bride and calling Jesus our groom.
We’re being married into the family of God.  

(SKIP) In John 3:29, John the Baptist meets Jesus for the first time and describes himself as a guest at a wedding where Jesus is the groom and the people of God are his bride. In Ephesians 5 Paul uses an analogy of a husband and wife to teach Christ-followers to submit to God and to celebrate that we are Christ’s bride. Finally, in Revelation 19:6-9, the Apostle John describes a wedding feast at the end of time when Christ returns triumphantly to celebrate being united with his bride, the Church—that’s us!



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)

[Notes]
But God isn’t just a being in a family.
The love enjoyed in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church is a particular kind of love.
Historically, Christians have characterized that love in six ways:
God’s love is complementary, intimate, procreative, faithful, sacrificial, and hospitable:

First, God’s love is complementary or diverse.
There is a different-ness between the persons of the Trinity—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit
And there is complementarity between Christ and his bride, the Church.






Intimacy & Family



“After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne…” (Revelations 7:9)

[Notes]
(SKIP) In Revelations 7:9, the Apostle John describes a celebration of the diversity of God’s people: “After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne…”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)

[Notes]
Second, God’s love is intimate.
The persons of the Trinity know each other perfectly and are fully known by each other.




Intimacy & Family



“‘My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they...be one as we are one—I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.’” (John 17:20)

[Notes]
(SKIP) In John 17:20, Jesus speaks longingly about the Trinity when praying for his disciples: “‘My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they...be one as we are one—I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.’
 




Intimacy & Family



“...At that moment heaven was opened, and [Jesus] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’” (Matthew 3:16-17)

[Notes]
God the Father reciprocates this affection.
Just after Jesus is baptized, the following happens in Matthew 3:16-17
“...At that moment heaven was opened, and [Jesus] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’”



Intimacy & Family



“Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. We love because he first loved us.” (1 John 4: 7, 8, and 19)

[Notes]
Plus, Christ intimately knows and loves His people and wants them to seek out relationship with Him.

(SKIP)  1 John 4: 7, 8, and 19 say, “Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. We love because he first loved us.” We can only love because God Himself is love, made us to be creatures who love, and loved us first.




Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)

[Notes]
Third, God’s love is procreative or life-giving.
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit made the world, filled it with animals, and made us humans, together.
The Trinity gave us life.
And then God became man and Jesus lived and died for us so that we could have life.

In John 10:10 Jesus says, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.”
Without Jesus we are dead people walking.
We have sinned against God, and we do not deserve to join Him in heaven.
But Jesus paid the price for our sins so that we could have eternal life.
 
Fourth, the love of God is faithful or permanent.
There is a perfect and permanent faithfulness in the Trinity and from Christ to His people.
No matter what we do, God will never abandon us or withhold his love.




Intimacy & Family



“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is [God’s] faithfulness.” (Lamentations 3:22-23)

[Notes]
(SKIP) Lamentations 3:22-23 says it this way: “The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is [God’s] faithfulness.”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)

[Notes]
Fifth, the love of God is sacrificial.
As we’ve already mentioned, Jesus offered himself up as a perfect sacrifice so that all of God’s children could return to Him. 




Intimacy & Family



“You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly... But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:6 and 8)

[Notes]
(SKIP) Paul describes Christ’s sacrifice in this way in Romans 5:6 and 8: “You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly... But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)
Hospitable (Luke 14, Leviticus 19)

[Notes]
And finally, the love of God is hospitable.
Ultimately, the work of creating this world and humans to fill it was an invitation into God’s family.
And then God extended His arms of invitation again by dying on the cross so we could be reunited with Him.



Intimacy & Family



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

[Notes]
Okay, but what does the fact that God is in family and enjoy love in that family characterized by those 6 things have to do with us, humans?

Well, because we are created in God’s image, we are made for that kind of love with God and each other
We were made for image-bearing intimacy.





Intimacy & Family



“‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.” (Genesis 1:26-27)

[Notes]
“‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.”

That’s what God said in Genesis 1:26-27 when He created the first humans.
We are made in His image. We are imitations, designed to be like God.
That’s a big deal, and there’s so much we can learn from that.
If we were designed to imitate God, then the nature of God can teach us about ourselves.
If we’re unsure what we were made for—what we need—one way to figure that out is by looking at what God values, how He relates to the people around Him.
So if God enjoys intimacy in the context of family, maybe we are made for those same things, because we are made in His image.





Intimacy & Family



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

Sexuality – our need for relationship, to know and be known, to give and receive that kind of love

[Notes]
So God enjoys love characterized by diversity, intimacy, giving life, faithfulness, sacrifice, and hospitality.
And we’re made in his image for that same kind of love
So we’re all made for human intimacy complementary, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment, sacrifice, and hospitality

our sexuality is our need for those things
our need to be in relationship
to know and be known
to give and receive love
and because we are mind, body, and spirit, we need connection on cognitive, physical, and spiritual levels





Intimacy & Family



We are all created for intimacy in the context of family.

[Notes]
But God didn’t just enjoy intimacy
He enjoyed it in the context of family
And we’re made in His image for that too
We were made for image-bearing family.

we are all created to enjoy this within the context of family. But when I say family, I don’t just mean married people and kids
In Matthew 12:46-50, Jesus subverts our understanding of family, rejecting familial ties based solely on biology and instead establishing that Christian family is bound by the blood of Christ:




Intimacy & Family



“While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, ‘Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.’ But to the one who had told him this, Jesus replied, ‘Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?’ And pointing to his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’” (Matthew 12:46-50)

[Notes]
“While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, ‘Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.’ But to the one who had told him this, Jesus replied, ‘Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?’ And pointing to his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’”

Jesus defines Christian family as a small community of Christians who live life together and embody the gospel for each other. 



Intimacy & Family



We are all created for intimacy in the context of family.

Family – a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other

[Notes]
From the beginning, families made up of God’s children were intended to imitate the love within the Trinity and between God and His people: to bear the image of that love.
The love found in families was intended to be intimate, faithful, sacrificial, diverse, live-giving, and hospitable, embodying God’s love in beautiful ways.

We are ALL made for that!

How might this broader definition of family as “a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other” challenge the idolatry of romance in your community?
29



Intimacy & Family



We don’t need romance, sex, or marriage, and that is good news.

We have emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy needs.


[Notes]
Some caveats or limitations about this intimacy in the context of family:

We don’t need romance, sex, or marriage, and that is good news.
We don’t actually need romance or marriage or sex to meet our needs for intimacy.
The Bible never promises marriage or sex to people who follow God, and nowhere does God say we need marriage or sex to be whole, happy people.
Yes, we have physical and emotional needs.
And yes, romance and sex are one way we can fill those, but not the only ways.
Let me explain.

One way to think about our needs for connection is to imagine a set of buckets that need to be filled with water.
Each of the buckets represent a kind of intimacy we need.
God made us mind, body, and spirit, so we need connection on an emotional level, intellectual level, physical level, and spiritual level.



Intimacy & Family





[Notes]
When I say emotional intimacy, I mean having conversations that help you connect with gladness or fear or anger or sadness inside of you, and where you notice some of those same things in others.

When I say spiritual intimacy, I mean connecting in a way that makes you feel more connected to God, by talking about spiritual things, reading Scripture together, or worshipping together.

When I say physical intimacy, I mean a hug, holding hands, sitting next to each other on the couch, putting your arm around someone’s shoulder, and yes, kissing and cuddling and sex.

When I say intellectual intimacy, I mean exchanging and exploring ideas with another person.

Imagine four buckets, one labeled “emotional,” the second labeled “spiritual,” the third labeled “physical,” and the fourth labeled “intellectual.”
Now some would argue that there is a fifth bucket labeled “sexual.” That we all need sexual intimacy to be whole, and if we don’t get it, we will feel empty.

But I know plenty of people who have never had sex and who are full adults.
They share with me that they have vibrant social lives, rich intimacy, and a satisfying experience of community.
That’s been true in my own life.
The healthy emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy I have experienced in friendships has been much more satisfying than the broken physical intimacy I have experienced in the past.

Plus, the Bible doesn’t teach that we need sex or marriage to be whole people.
Quite the opposite. Jesus didn’t have sex. Paul was committed to celibacy.
Many of the mothers and fathers of the Church have been celibate.
And Jesus says that in Heaven, there won’t be any more marriage or sex.



Intimacy & Family



“At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” (Matthew 22:30)

[Notes]
In Matthew 22:30, He says this: “At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.”

It doesn’t make too much sense that our Savior was celibate or that we will all be celibate in heaven if marriage and sex are necessary to be fully human.

Instead, there are four intimacy buckets. Emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual.
God provides a good chunk of our spiritual intimacy.
Those who are married will partially fill each of those buckets with the intimacy from their marriage.
But, even if you’re married, God and your spouse alone won’t fill your intimacy needs buckets.
You will still need emotional intimacy, intellectual intimacy, physical intimacy, and spiritual intimacy from friendship.



Intimacy & Family





[Notes]
And that’s good news!

That’s good news for single people.
If either a call from God or circumstances lead you to a life without romance, marriage, or sex, you can still fill your buckets.
You can still meet your emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy needs in healthy ways through friendship.

That’s good news for married people.
Trying to squeeze all of your intimacy needs out of God and your spouse is a good recipe for divorce.
But since you don’t need romance or sex to fill any of your intimacy need buckets, you can meet the rest of your intimacy needs through intimate friendship.



Share



Why do some believe we NEED romance, sex, or marriage?

How might seeing our intimacy needs as buckets to be filled with intimacy with God, friends, and (for some) a spouse change the way we respond to our longings?
41



Intimacy & Family



None of us will meet our intimacy needs fully and finally in this lifetime.

If we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, the broken parts of our soul and mind tend to reach out for destructive and unsatisfying shortcuts.


[Notes]
None of us will meet our intimacy needs fully and finally in this lifetime.
Isaiah 59:2 says that our sins, our imperfection, our unwise choices have separated us from God and each other.
Because this world is broken and we are broken, we can only ever connect with God and each other imperfectly.
There’s this distance because of brokenness that we can never cross.
Some amount of loneliness is a part of life.
It is unavoidable.
 
So should we just give up and stop trying to connect in healthy ways? No!
For starters, even if we can’t meet all of our needs fully and finally, we can still get a lot of what we need.
We can still enjoy rich, satisfying intimacy with God and other people in this life.
And second, if we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, the broken parts of our soul and mind tend to reach out for destructive and unsatisfying shortcuts.

Have you noticed that?
When you ignore your need for community and connection and try to go at it alone, you end up making unwise decisions later.
Lust, objectification, masturbation, pornography, dating apps, meaningless hookups, and adultery all become more difficult to resist.
If we try to meet our intimacy needs in those broken ways, we won’t fill our buckets.
We just kick them over, and it makes a mess. Instead, we need to actively work to meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways.
We need to be intentional about seeking out intimate friendship with others and proactively meet our needs.




Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)
Hospitable (Luke 14, Leviticus 19)

[Notes]
So God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.
And the love we enjoy in that family should point us back to the love in God’s family, should serve as an image of God’s love, should embody the gospel by being complementary, intimate, procreative, faithful, sacrificial, and hospitable

So what does that look like practically?
And how do we do that well?

In short, God has given us two specific ways to do that, he has designed two vocations for stewarding our sexualities in ways that honor Him and point us back to Him:
vocational singleness and Christian marriage
Both of these vocations embody those 6 characteristics of the love in God’s family
Both vocations are calls to intimacy in the context of human family



Intimacy & Family



Christian vocation - a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children

[Notes]
Why do I say vocation? Well, A Christian vocation is generally a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision. 

Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom work with undivided attention
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman with an openness to raising children for the kingdom

The practice of vocational singleness and Christian marriage in our churches should be so beautiful that those who do not yet know Jesus want to draw close to them and get to know the Source of that love
When non-believers step into the homes of Christian marriages or vocational singles living together as a family, the love found there should help people believe that God loves them
And they should experience God’s love through those families

That’s why it’s so important for our churches to be places where people are thriving in Christian marriage and vocational singleness—because the gospel depends on it
And that’s why we have to teach accurately about these



Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of temporary singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to a vocation of Christian marriage
Others called to a vocation of singleness for the kingdom

[Notes]
So, how does a Christian know which of these vocations they are called to?
What’s God’s design for each of these vocations?
How do we do them well?

Here’s a summary of how Christians have historically understood the Bible to teach about sexual stewardship
This is the big picture for what it looks like to faithfully, in God-honoring ways, steward our sexualities



Sexual Stewardship




[Notes]
Here’s a representation of those same ideas in a diagram

As we will tease out more later, vocational singleness is distinct from temporary singleness
It is best for everyone to settle down into marriage or vocational singleness, instead of continuing in temporary singleness
Marriage and vocational singleness are equally good callings, but marriage will be more common
There is no default path, one’s calling should be an open-handed question for every Christian

Remember, I’ll tease out all of these claims in the slides to come

How different is this diagram of sexual stewardship from what you learned growing up?

How might seeing oneself called to temporary singleness and assuming neither marriage nor vocational singleness be beneficial?

Stewardship for All



How has God created us for intimacy in the context of family?
What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?
What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?
What is Christian marriage, and why does God’s wisdom matter?

[Notes]
So, we’ve built a solid foundation for how God has created us in His image to enjoy intimacy in the context of family
And we’re gonna move on to exploring the kind of singleness we’re all born into, God’s good design for vocational singleness and Christian marriage, and how Christian young adults can discover whether God wants to give then the gift of vocational singleness or the gift of Christian marriage

But before I do that, I want to remind us why we’re spending so much time building up a systematic theology of sexual stewardship for all people
Why we’re not spending all of our time talking about how to convince your gay students not to have gay sex
Or 10 tips for ministering to LGBT+ students
(don’t worry, we will get to that)

We’re focusing on sexual stewardship for all people because we’ve consistently heard from you that gay and straight students are quickly rejecting a traditional sexual ethic for gay people
Claiming it’s inconsistent and not good for gay people

Do you want to know why our appeals for a biblical sexual ethic aren’t working?
Because when I listen in on the average youth pastor or campus minister or head pastor teach about God’s wisdom for gay people,
it’s a one-time talk or 3-part series focused narrowly on sexual and gender minority issues,
talking about the most controversial questions,
And ultimately calling gay people to difficult things
While never talking about the sexual stewardship of straight people
Or calling straight people to the same good and weighty wisdom
And our students spot it
And they reject it

If you want your students, gay and straight, to thrive according to God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship
Then you’re gonna have to spend more of your time talking about sexual stewardship for all people
In ways that are internally consistent
In ways that answer the “why” questions
And in ways that appear more fair because they hear you calling straight people to wisdom that is just as countercultural but ultimately life-giving

Okay?!







TEMPORARY SINGLENESS


[Notes]
Okay, so let’s talk about where we all start our journey of sexual stewardship: temporary singleness



Temporary Singleness



A period of temporary singleness
Enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ
Called to neither lifelong vocational singleness nor marriage
Submit our sexuality to God, study the Scriptures, discern with God and others

[Notes]
We are all first called to a temporary period of abstinent singleness in which we enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ in non-sexual, non-romantic companionship.
We should all learn to do this well
This is a calling to neither vocational singleness nor marriage—defining our default calling in the negative is not sufficient but it is informative—we are not yet called to vocational singleness or to marriage. 
We should not assume that we are called to marriage just because we have sexual desires, want to be a parent, or find abstinent singleness to be too challenging. 
We should all submit our sexuality to God, study what the Scriptures have to say about sexual stewardship, and discern with God and spiritual mentors in our lives whether we are called to vocational singleness or marriage.

Why make this distinction between temporary singleness and vocational singleness?
Well, we are all born into temporary singleness
that’s our default state
and then some of us are called to Christian marriage
and others of us are called to a lifetime vocation of singleness for the sake of the kingdom
 
why is this important?
because there’s a big difference between just waiting for marriage versus accepting a call to permanently give up the prospect of romance, sex, marriage, or children in order to use that availability to do kingdom work parents can’t
My friends in temporary singleness seem to be only shallowly rooted in their spiritual families and the kingdom work they’re doing, because they need to always be prepared to reorganize their lives around a future marriage
and the two passages where Jesus and Paul encourage every Christian to consider singleness aren’t commending temporary singleness
they’re commending vocational singleness
In order to receive the gift from God to do vocational singleness well, we have to step out of temporary singleness and into committed singleness

For the vast majority, it is better to settle down into vocational singleness or marriage
But there are always exceptions to the rule
There will be people whom God calls to leave open the possibility of vocational singleness or marriage in there 30s, 40s, 50s, or perhaps even their entire life
Our churches need to honor and support all those who are faithfully following God’s call








Why should everyone discern?
Matthew 19:11-12 and 1 Corinthians 7 make clear that our relational vocation—marriage or vocational singleness—is called and given, not chosen


Temporary Singleness

[Notes]
Why should everyone discern between vocational singleness and Christian marriage?
Why should everyone open-handedly offer these possibilities to God and seek His preference?

God calls us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness
the Bible teaches that our vocation is given or called, not chosen
God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us

Where does Scripture teach this?
In Matthew 19, verse 11, in his response to the disciples’ shock about his high standard for marriage, Jesus says that only those to whom the calling of marriage has been given will accept his teachings about marriage. And then in verse 12, Jesus says that only those to whom the calling of vocational singleness has been given will accept his teachings about vocational singleness.
Jesus says that God calls us to either marriage or vocational singleness, and God gives us a gift to thrive in that vocation
Then in 1 Corinthians 7 verse 7, Paul says that he wishes all were like him—all were called to vocational singleness—but God has given each his own gift. God has called some to vocational singleness. God has called others to marriage.

Our preference does not matter
We can share our preference with God, but ultimately we should learn what God’s preference is and ask Him to conform our desires to His desires







A desire to marry, a desire to be a parent, or difficulty being single doesn’t indicate God’s calling.

Each of us has the same inherent capacity for both marriage and vocational singleness. 
But…

[Notes]
now a single person might push back
God has given me a desire to marry
to be a parent
And being single doesn’t come easily to me
I don’t have what it takes to be single for a lifetime
Marriage is natural, but being single for a lifetime is supernatural

By that logic—that a desire to marry, a desire to be a parent, or a difficulty being single tells us we’re called to marriage—the only people who are called to vocational singleness are asexual people.
Clearly that was not Christ’s intention

And marriage and vocational singleness are actually equally natural
Does the average Christian automatically possess everything they need to thrive in vocational singleness? No.
But the same is true of marriage.
We don’t have what we need to do marriage well either.
In light of the Fall, romance, sex, and polyamory are natural.
Each of us has the same inherent but incomplete capacity for both vocational singleness and marriage
But to do either well, we must step into that vocation and receive an additional gift to do it well

Or you might point out 1 Cor 7:9 that says ”it is better to marry than to burn”
A common interpretation of 1 Corinthians 7:9 is that poor sexual stewardship in singleness shows that one has not been given the gift of singleness and should instead marry.
Now, it’s more accurate to read this as a specific rebuke of Corinthian Christians who had adopted quasi-gnostic ideas that the real us was our mind and spirit
That our bodies were these gross containers we are stuck in for a lifetime but would be thrown away
So it didn’t matter if we mistreated our bodies
As a result, some of these Corinthian Christians were claiming to be celibate in spirit but then engaging in unrestrained sexual immorality because the body didn’t matter
Regardless, the general principle holds true: it is unwise to walk the path of a vocation of singleness without the gift to do it well.
But the same could be said of marriage: it is unwise to engage in some of the activities of marriage without God’s provision that comes from taking marriage vows and stepping into that vocation fully.










Is the word discernment used in the Bible in this specific way? No.

But it leaves an undeniably discernment-shaped hole that the Church has consistently commended.
Why discern?

[Notes]
Ultimately, is the word discernment used in this way in any of passages of scripture? No
but all of this leaves an undeniably discernment-shaped hole
and its the conclusion of the early Church, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the two Protestant theologians to offer us a systematic theology of celibacy: Max Thurian and Karl Barth

if there's no default path,
if we must step forward out of temporary singleness and commit to something in order to receive the gift,
if both vocations are permanent,
if God has a preference and is calling us,
if we're not supposed to just take what we want or step forward recklessly
how do we learn God's preference from Him?
how do we hear the call?
how do we know which path to step toward?
how do we make sure we consider this question carefully?
DISCERNMENT

So God eventually calls most of us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness.
And everyone should discern this question of vocational singleness or Christian marriage
We should all open-handedly offer these possibilities to God and seek His preference







Grow your ”spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Remove any emotional or theological barriers to clear discernment
Consider what kind of work you might be called to
Consider your past and current circumstances
Seek support from your church
How to discern

[Notes]
We’ve established WHY every Christian young adult should discern
Now let’s briefly explore HOW
Here’s 5 suggestions

Grow your ”spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Do you know how to bring a question before God,
consider Scripture,
consider practical aspects of your question,
seek advice from spiritual mentors,
arrive at a potential conclusion,
hold that conclusion before God,
seek confirmation through small steps,
and move forward with confidence?
Before we ask a question as important as marriage or vocational singleness, let’s practice our skills of discernment on less consequential decisions.
A good book on this is God’s Voice Within

Second, remove any emotional or theological barriers to clear discernment
You need to make sure you have a healthy theological understanding of both vocational singleness and marriage so that you aren’t biased against either
And work through any emotional barriers: fear of marriage because of a family history of divorce or an idolatry of romance

Third, consider what kind of work you might be called to, and see if that points you toward vocational singleness or marriage
If you feel like the primary work you’ve been called to is to raise children for the Church, then you’re probably called to marriage
Or if you feel called to a mission that might be mutually exclusive with raising children
Like a special mission, a difficult ministry, a life of contemplation or study, or monastic life, then you’re probably called to vocational singleness

Four, consider your past and current circumstances
Have any experiences from your past pointed you toward one vocation or another?
Or perhaps you find yourself single later in life and ask, “I am still single not by accident, but because God has called me to vocational singleness?”
I’m not saying that every adult who is single later in life has been called to vocational singleness
But perhaps if someone is single later in life, that is a sign of God’s intentions

And fifth, seek support from your church in the discernment process. Invite mentors to lead you in this process.
Get feedback from friends and family about your discernment. These people can often provide better advice with an outside perspective.

Stewardship for All



How has God created us for intimacy in the context of family?
What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?
What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?
What is Christian marriage, and why does God’s wisdom matter?

[Notes]
Next, let’s focus on vocational singleness
What is it?
Why does God call some people to it?



VOCATIONAL SINGLENESS







Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.

Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Let’s break down that definition of vocational singleness






“a lifetime calling…”
God calls us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness.
God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us.
God intended for vocational singleness to be committed and permanent.
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling...

It’s a calling. God eventually calls most of us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness.

As we’ve already talked about, the Bible teaches that our vocation is given or called, not chosen.
God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us.
Everyone should open-handedly offer this question of vocational singleness or Christian marriage to God, and everyone has the same inherent capacity for both vocations. 
 
But it’s not just a calling. It’s a lifetime calling.
God intends for vocational singleness to be committed and permanent.
- In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus speaks of a call beyond temporary singleness and compares vocational singleness to being a eunuch, a state which is permanent.
- We cannot imagine Jesus providing the 100-fold blessing promised in Luke 18:28-30 to someone who has only temporarily given up the prospect of marriage and children, only to later get married.
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul recognizes and praises committed singleness and teaches that it is better to keep a commitment to vocational singleness than get married.
Then in 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul reaffirms that a commitment to vocational singleness is good and to break that commitment is a sin.

If that wasn’t enough, 
the disciples of the apostles, and their disciples and their disciples unanimously understood Jesus and Paul to be commending permanent celibacy
Instead of waiting for marriage
We’re talking about people like St. Clement of Rome (the disciple and successor of Peter the Apostle), St. Ignatius of Antioch (the disciple of John the Apostle), St. Justin the Martyr, St. Athenagoras of Athens, Polycrates of Ephesus, Tertullian, St. Cyprian of Carthage, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and St. Methodius of Olympus.







“a lifetime calling to singleness…”
A call to give up romance, dating, marriage, and sex
Still a call to intimacy in the context of committed family
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness...

Vocational singleness is a call to give up romance, dating, marriage, sex, and children, but that doesn’t mean that a person is called to loneliness.

In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus talks about vocational singleness as a giving up of romance, marriage, sex, and children.
And then in Luke 18:28-30, Jesus promises a 100-fold of brothers, sisters, and children now in this present time to those who give up the potential for a spouse and children for the sake of the kingdom.
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul confirms that vocational singleness involves giving up sex, romance, marriage, and children but recognizes that those called to vocational singleness still need committed companionship.

Vocational singleness is still a call to intimacy in the context of committed family.
In Isaiah 56:3-5, the celibate is promised family, belonging, and honor equal to the married person, that they will be full and equal members of the family of God, that they will be spiritual parents in ways just as great as biological parents.
Then in 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul recognizes early families of celibate people by commending a committed community of celibate women.

Now that we know what vocational singleness is, now let’s explore why God calls some people to this lifetime vocation of singleness.






Stay with biological family
Join another nuclear family
Create families of vocationally single people
Family in Singleness

[Notes]
But how can vocational singleness find intimacy in the context of permanent, lived-in human family?
Here’s 3 ways:

First, we can encourage people to stay deeply connected to their biological family.
This might look like living with a parent, a sibling, or a cousin, doing rhythms of family with those people, and committing to helping them raise the children in that household.

Or, you might help single people knit themselves into unrelated nuclear families in your church.
Maybe people go out of their way to choose celibate people as godparents for their children.
Or you invite single people to weekly dinner with your family.
Or include them in holidays and vacations.
You could even invite single people to live in your home, commit to your family, and help you raise your kids.

Or third, you can help celibate people create families of their own
Help celibate people gather together and commit to being family for each other and doing rhythms of family together.
This is perhaps the least conventional of the options suggested here, and while it might be the most beautiful, it also involved the most logistics.
Churches can help support celibate people in creating these intentional Christian communities by suggesting the idea, helping them cast vision for it, providing pastoral support while they explore the possibility, coaching them through the process, and maybe even providing financial support in the early years.
For example, 5 of us in Nashville are building the Nashville Family of Brothers.
It’s is an ecumenically Christian monastery offering family in Nashville for men called to vocational singleness.
We’re still a part of our local churches.
We’ve got jobs outside of the brotherhood.
We’re still connected to parents and their kids.
And 5 of us pray and eat and worship and vacation and serve and live together in a home as a family as we discern whether to make lifetime commitments to each other.
This are the kind of solutions the Church needs

Regardless of which path they take, they need intimate, committed, and permanent family just like everyone else
You’ve noticed that each solution involves living together and commitment
We need to help celibate people find that
Because it is particularly hard for celibate people to find that
And the paths are often unconventional

What’s lacking in the evidence from Scripture and the early Church that the singleness Jesus and Paul spoke of was intended to be permanent?

How might a permanent giving up of romance and dating free those called to vocational singleness to focus on kingdom work and their spiritual family?
1:25

[Notes]
 







“a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom”
Do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time and energy to do
Embody the gospel in unique ways
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Why does God call some to Vocational Singleness?
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.

Jesus uses the phrase “for the sake of the kingdom” in Matthew 19:1-12 and Luke 18:28-30 to describe vocational singleness.
Those called to vocational singleness live “for the sake of the kingdom” in three ways:

First, God intended for those in vocational singleness to use their availability, primarily from not raising children, to do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time, energy, or financial freedom to do.
In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus invites his disciples to consider giving up the potential for spouse and children in order to live “like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom,” referring to Old Testament eunuchs who commonly worked for a king, managing and building up the king’s kingdom.
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul explains that vocational singleness involves giving up a spouse and children to be more concerned with the work of the Church.
In 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul commends faithful members of the community of celibate women who have fully committed themselves to the Lord.

Second, Vocational singleness is for the sake of the kingdom because it embodies the gospel.
Similarly to marriage, vocational singleness is an image of the love found in God’s family (the Trinity and between Christ and the Church), preaching the gospel by reflecting that love.
Vocational singleness is spiritually procreative, sacrificial, committed, intimate, and hospitable, pointing those who see that image back to the original source: God’s love.






Diverse – differentness of personalities, sexes, ages
Intimate – still a call to family, fullness of God’s love in NHNE
Faithful – permanent and lifetime, consistent kingdom work
Vocational singleness is…
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Now, let’s look at the ways singleness for the sake of the kingdom embodies those six characteristics of love found in the Trinity and between Christ and His Church.

Vocational singleness is diverse.
The friendships enjoyed by those committed to vocational singleness reflect the diversity in God’s family.
There is a differentness between the persons in each friendship.
Plus, vocational singles still need healthy relationships with people of the opposite sex, parents, and children.
Vocational singleness is still a call to a diversity of friendships with people of all ages and stages of life.
This differentness points observers back to the complementarity in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church as well as the unity found in the body of Christ even amidst differences.

2. Vocational singleness is intimate.
As already mentioned, vocational singleness is still a call to intimacy in the context of family.
Jesus and Paul recognize vocational singles’ need for committed companionship and promise a 100-fold of family in this lifetime.
This intimacy points observers back to the intimacy in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church.
The family vocational singles enjoy testifies to the fullness of God’s love and gives every Christian hope for how we will all live in the New Heavens and New Earth.

3. Vocational singleness is faithful.
The permanent, lifetime nature of a commitment to vocational singleness reflects the faithfulness of God’s love found in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church.
Through this vocation, those called faithfully live out their singleness for the Lord consistently build up the kingdom in ways that point back to the faithfulness of the love in God’s family.







Life-giving – spiritually procreative and more kingdom work
Sacrificial – give up idol of romance to follow Jesus
Hospitable – offer family to lonely
Vocational singleness is…
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
4. Vocational singleness is life-giving.
While those called to vocational singleness do not bear biological children, their availability for kingdom works should bear the fruit of many times more spiritual children.
The vocationally single have the time and energy to share the gospel with more not-yet-believers and mentor more new Christians than parents can.
Plus, those called to vocational singleness reflect the procreative nature of God’s love by building up the kingdom and bringing spiritual life to the Church.

5. Vocational singleness is sacrificial.
At first glance, those called to vocational singleness have chosen to give up their right to some of our culture’s most coveted experiences: romance, dating, marriage, and sex.
The sacrifice of vocational singles points observers back to the sacrificial nature of the love in God’s family.

6. Vocational singleness is hospitable.
Those called to vocational singleness have the unique opportunity to offer family to those on the margins without the need to compete for belonging.
This hospitality reflects the welcoming nature of the love in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church.






“a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom”
Do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time and energy to do
Embody the gospel in unique ways
Give every Christian hope for the New Heavens and New Earth 
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
And Third, Vocational singleness is for the sake of the kingdom because it gives every Christian hope for the New Heavens and New Earth.
In Luke 20:34-36, Jesus teaches that all will be celibate in the New Heaven and New Earth.
So vocational singleness preaches the gospel in way that marriage does not by serving as a physical sign and hope for how we will all live in the NHNE. 

Contemporaries of early Christians saw marriage as a necessity to secure physical protection, wealth, and a legacy through descendants.
So when Christians called to vocational singleness fulfilled the promises in Isaiah 56:3-5 and Luke 18:29 by experiencing more family, more belonging, and more honor than married people, they provided Christians with a preview of and hope for a New Heavens and New Earth where God would keep us safe, provide everything we needed, and would never forget us. 

But today, westerners seem interested in romance and marriage because they promise a way to find faithful love and escape loneliness.
So modern Christian vocational singleness can uniquely testify to the fullness of God’s love by previewing a time when we don’t have to compete—to be more attractive or intelligent or funny than others—in order to be loved by others and belong in a family
Christians today should look at those in vocational singleness, see them enjoying intimate community without the need for romance, exclusivity, or competing for each others’ affection; and that preview should give every Christian hope for the fullness of God’s love in the kingdom to come.






Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.

How has God created us for intimacy in the context of family?
What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?
What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?
What is Christian marriage, and why does God’s wisdom matter?

[Notes]

We’ve explored why and how Christian young adults should discern
We’ve described what vocational singleness is and why God calls some to vocational singleness
Now lets define the vocation of Christian marriage and wrap up with why all of this matters



CHRISTIAN
MARRIAGE




Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman with an openness to raise children for the kingdom.



Christian Marriage



Christian marriage…
Christian marriage is joined, entered into, and sustained by God in ways other marriages are not.

[Notes]
Christian marriage

Christian = joined, entered into, and sustained by God
Christian marriage is not just natural marriage as God designed at Creation
Christian marriage is natural marriage plus a gospel purpose revealed by Christ’s life, death, and resurrection
God does not join, enter into, or sustain a non-Christian marriages in the same way He does a true Christian marriages





Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment…
Matthew 5:32, Romans 7:2-3, and 1 Cor 7:10-11,39 provide no grounds for divorce

[Notes]
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment
God expects that our vows to our spouse be permanent.

In Matthew 19, Jesus calls God’s people back to lifelong monogamy, declaring that Moses allowed the Jewish people to divorce, giving them over to their broken desires, because their hearts were hardened to God and His created intention. Then, according to more modern translations, Jesus seemingly provides an exception to this high standard of permanence,
but other presentations of this episode in other Gospels lack this exception,
and Jesus teaches clearly in Matthew 5:32 that if you marry someone who has been divorced, you commit adultery, without any exception.

Paul confirms Christ’s teachings in Romans 7:2-3 and 1 Corinthians 7:10-11, 39 that there are no biblical grounds for divorce.
Scholars argue that this exception in Matthew 19 is more likely allowing for separation without remarriage or referring to dissolving a false marriage: marriages entered into under false pretenses, a marriage never consummated, or a marriage to a concubine (1 Corinthians 5:1, Acts 15:20, Acts 15:29). 

Regardless, Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment, no exceptions





Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman…
God instituted natural marriage between one man and one woman, confirmed by Jesus and Paul

[Notes]
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman

God instituted natural marriage in Genesis 2, clearly defining marriage as between one man and one woman and established sex difference as part of what makes a marriage. In Matthew 19, Jesus reaffirms God’s original intentions for monogamous, lifelong marriage between one man and one woman.
In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul does the same, stating that each husband should have only one wife, and each wife have only one husband.
Then in Ephesians 5, Paul teaches that the sexual difference in Christian marriage is meant to reflect to differentness in Christ’s relationship with the Church.





Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman with an openness to raise children for the kingdom.
God’s procreation mandate stands for those called to Christian marriage

[Notes]
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman with an openness to raise children for the kingdom

I want to be clear, raising children is not the only good thing enjoyed in marriage, but it is in particular what sets it apart from vocational singleness
Obviously, just like vocational singleness, it is a call to embody the gospel and enjoy healthy intimacy

But since the beginning of time, marriage was meant to be a space to raise children.
In Genesis 1: 28, God commands the first marriage to “be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.” This procreation mandate is affirmed in Genesis 9 and Psalm 127.
Raising children is a central purpose of Christian marriage, and God’s command for Christian marriages to raise children was never rescinded.(note, I’ve been careful to say raise children, and not necessarily have children.
As a rule, a Christian marriage is a space to raise children, whether that be one’s own or as foster or adoptive parents. While infrequent, there are always exceptions to the rule.)

For those who are called to marriage, they should recognize that marriage will be one of the most difficult things they do









How does marriage embody the gospel?
Complementary of the genders/sexes both psychologically and biologically reflect the Trinity and Christ’s relationship with the Church
Intimate – sexually, emotionally, and spiritually

[Notes]
How does Christian marriage specifically embody the gospel and reflect the Trinity and God’s relationship with the Church?

hospitable - invite others into home

those called to marriage will thrive when they seek to fulfill these purposes
Churches must teach accurately about what marriage is and support families to keep their vows and raise children

Some doubt whether Christian marriage must be opposite-sex, open to raising children, and truly lifetime. How essential are these? What are the consequences of dismissing these as essential?
2:03



Why Follow?




If a god exists, he’s the God of the Bible, and that God knows what is best for us—we’d be fools not to follow God’s wisdom

God’s wisdom will lead us to the deepest experiences of joy and purpose and true pleasure in this life

[Notes]
Why follow God’s wisdom about intimacy and family?
God seems to have a lot of rules for how we should seek out intimacy and family.
Living your life according to that wisdom seems inconvenient. Why follow God’s wisdom?

If we believe that a god exists, if we believe that god is the God of the Bible, and if we believe that God knows what is best for us—if we really believe all of those things, we would be fools not to follow God’s wisdom.
If Lebron James was your basketball coach and you ignored his advice about how to become a better basketball player, you’d be a fool!
How much better advice does God have about the ways to enjoy the most goodness and beauty and meaning in this life? Trust Him!

We have been designed, by God, for specific purposes.
That matters.
We shouldn’t be surprised that when we allow ourselves to live in ways we weren’t designed to, we get hurt.
We shouldn’t be surprised that when we use romance, marriage, and sex contrary to God’s design, it brings pain to our lives.

If God’s wisdom is best for us, following His teachings will save us from unnecessary pain of figuring out the best paths through trial and error.
Plus, God’s wisdom will lead us to the deepest experiences of joy and purpose and true pleasure in this life.




THE PROBLEM


[Notes]
But here’s the problem
Churches aren’t doing this well
And we can’t get better until we admit we have a problem and we identify them
So where are our areas of growth?





The Problem(s)



God gave me desires to marry and have kids because He wants me to get married.
Marriage is about companionship and mutual fulfillment.
We only have to have kids if and when we want them.
God calls a select few to vocational singleness and sustains them spiritually.
Friendship can’t provide what marriage can and shouldn’t be too close.

[Notes]
Here’s what Christians really seem to believe today



The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
Straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage
There is no support for vocational singleness
We live disconnected, isolated lives

[Notes]
What are the results of having those beliefs?

we don’t refrain from emotionally and physically intimate relationships before marriage
we assume we will be married, that marriage will satisfy, and that marriage is about making you happy
we no longer honor “through thick and thin” or see raising children as central
straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage

few consider vocational singleness as a calling
Celibacy is relegated to a curse of loneliness for the sake of the gospel
there is no support for vocational singleness because no straight people are doing it

We don’t learn to do friendship well, have loose friendships
fear of close, same-sex friendships
We don’t do life as a Body of Christ
We live disconnected, isolated lives



The Problem(s)



This hurts straight Christians
Children grow up hearing all people will be straight, married, and have kids
Failed marriages due to refusing a call to vocational singleness and inaccurate expectations
Vocational singles struggle with loneliness and married people raise children alone

[Notes]
This hurts straight Christians

children are hearing that all people will be straight, married, with kids
but at least one of those won’t be true for a lot of our kids

many marriages fail due to refusing a call to vocational singleness
or not accurately seeing marriage as a vocation that is lifelong and difficult

Celibates struggle with loneliness while married people raise children alone



The Problem(s)



Many people and circumstances on the margins:
Divorce
Widowing
Infertility
Pornography
Masturbation
Fornication
Adultery
Abortion
Contraception
Same-sex attraction
Broken gender

[Notes]
This also hurts gay people
But same-sex attraction is just one of the ways that God’s perfect intentions for human intimacy is bent
there are lots of people and circumstances on the margins
there are lots of ways that the way we do intimacy is broken

divorce
widowing
infertility
pornography (lust, objectification, selfish, commodification)
masturbation
sex outside of marriage
adultery
abortion
contraception
same-sex attraction
broken gender

Some but not all of these are due to individual sin
But these are all communal sins that require a communal responses

So talking theologically about how God has invited us to steward our sexualities doesn’t just help us to answer the question of same-sex marriage
It can also help us respond to each of these areas of brokenness

How common are those misshapen beliefs about sexuality among your students?

How might our broader understanding of God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship help us address other manifestations of sexual brokenness?

LOVE & WISDOM


[Notes]
In light of God’s wisdom for everyone’s sexual stewardship, what, then, is God’s specific love and wisdom for gay people?



What’s God offering?
God does not bless same-sex marriages because they fall outside of God’s design for marriage
There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses
Same-sex sexual/romantic activity is sinful
God offers LGBT+ Christians the same options as everyone else: vocational singleness or marriage





[Notes]
Well, theologically, without even getting into debating whether the Bible has anything directly to say about same-sex sexual and romantic activity
We can already answer the question about what God wants to offer gay people
Based on God’s design for the vocations that He blesses, based on God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship for all people

Same-sex marriages do not fulfill God’s design for Christian marriage
Anymore than two opposite-sex non-Christians do
Or two opposite-sex Christians who don’t treat the marriage as lifelong or for the purposes of raising children

There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses

So, same-sex sexual and romantic activity are less than God’s best, they are sins

God offers LGBT+ Christians the same options as everyone else: vocational singleness or Christian marriage 

And then, there’s even more evidence for a traditional sexual ethic when we get to the 6 verses that talk directly about same-sex sexual activity



What do we believe?



Being gay is a result of the Fall. God did not intend for me to be gay.
Being gay is a brokenness, but it is not a sin.
God does not send people to hell merely for being gay.
Attractions, orientation, identity, and behavior are different

[Notes]
But when you engage in conversations with students about God’s love and wisdom for gay people, they aren’t just asking a simply question about whether gay sex is a sin
They’re looking for answers to a wider array of questions about God’s intentions, why things are the way they aren’t, and what good options are available to gay people

I want to model for you how you might answer those detailed questions by sharing with you how we at Equip answer those questions:
Perhaps you’ll find this language helpful in your own conversations

First, We believe that experiencing same-sex attraction, people finding other people of the same sex physically attractive and desiring romantic relationships with them, being gay, is a result of the Fall
That when Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, their sin led to a domino effect of brokenness. Their sin bent all of the ways God had perfectly designed and ordered this world. To the extent that this world around us, the people around us, and even ourselves are not how God first imagined us.
None of us are how God intended
All of us, regardless of sexual orientation, are corrupted at a genetic level, developed imperfectly in our mother’s womb, and were born into a broken world that wounded us long before we ever gained the capacity to sin
So we don’t think that when God first imagined any of us and projected us being born into a perfect world, that God planned for us to experience same-sex attraction
But because we are born into a broken world, one of the ways some are affected by that brokenness is that they gained these attractions
 
But I want to be clear that being gay, experiencing same-sex attraction, is not a sin
It is a brokenness, a temptation to sin, but God doesn’t hold against anyone their involuntary thoughts
God does not send people to hell merely because boys are attracted to boys or girls are attracted to girls

Third, Let me also point out at this point that there’s a big difference between attractions, orientation, identity, and behaviors
And when Christians on either extreme conflates these, it causes big problems
Same-sex attractions can be nothing more than infrequent or one-time recognition that someone of the same-sex is physically or sexually attractive
A same-sex sexual orientation is a consistent pattern of same-sex attractions
Same-sex sexual identity involves identifying as gay either by name and/or by participating in gay culture in ways that can be small like putting a rainbow sticker on one’s car
Same-sex sexual behavior consists of romantic and sexual activity
What I want you to see is that a Christian can experience infrequent same-sex attractions but not have a same-sex sexual orientation
A Christian can have a same-sex sexual orientation, but choose not to identify as gay
A same-sex attracted Christian can identify as gay but choose not to engage in same-sex romantic and sexual activity
But the extremes in the conversation want to deny that that nuance is possible
Those on the Left argue that all of these must line up in a particular direction, or the person is practicing self-hate
And people on the Right argue that in order to faithfully refrain from gay sex, a person must also find a way to eliminate their same-sex attractions or at least pretend they don’t experience them anymore






We do not choose who we are attracted to, but we choose how we respond.
A mix of nature and nurture contribute to the development of sexual orientation.
There is no proven formula for changes a persons’ attractions.
What do we believe?

[Notes]
Fourth, We also don’t believe people choose who they are attracted to, choose to be gay or straight,
But we do choose how we respond

Fifth, The consensus of scientists is that people develop their sexual attractions through a mix of nature and nurture, but people do not choose who they are attracted to
There is also no formula for changing a person’s attractions: no proven combination of prayer or counseling or weekend retreats to change someone’s sexual orientation
Certainly God has the power to do whatever he wants,
but scientific studies show that 96% of people who seek sexual orientation change efforts experience no change in their sexual orientation, but they do experience a 92% increase in suicidality due to sexual orientation change efforts (nearly doubling suicide attempts)

Now at this point, many people reasonably ask:
If same-sex attractions are broken, God didn’t intend for anyone to be gay, yet God allowed that brokenness to develop and rarely heals that brokenness when people ask God for healing, how is that fair?
At the core of that question is the timeless question: why do bad things happen to innocent people?
Right?
Because people don’t choose their sexual orientation, and gay people haven’t done anything to bring about their sexual orientation
They’re innocent
So why?
Well, in order for us to have real choice and true agency to choose to love God and other people, God has to let the consequences of our decisions play out
It’s the theological concept of free process
If God just swooped in and protected each of us from the consequences of the sins of others, would their choices have been real choice?
No
So if order for our love for God and each other to mean something, God chooses the greater good of allowing things to play out
How does that apply to broken sexuality?
We believe that gay people developed this brokenness because of the sins of others
Brokenness in their genes passed on through generations
Sin in the different environments they grew up in
And to protect free will, God chose not to swoop in and prevent them from developing SSAs by blocking the consequences of the decisions of others






God calls all Christians to vocational singleness or Christian marriage.
There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses.
Same-sex sexual and romantic activity are sins in any context.
What do we believe?

[Notes]
What does the Bible have to say about all of this?

Well, as we understand it, and as a majority of Christians have understood the Bible for 2,000 years, God calls all Christians to vocational singleness—to give up the prospect of romance, dating, sex, marriage, and children to do kingdom work parents don’t have the time or energy to do--or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex
there is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses in Scripture
same-sex sexual and romantic activity are sins in any context



SIDE ABX


[Notes]
Another way to clearly communicate what we believe about sexual ethics is to contrast it with extremes on both sides
An organization called the Gay Christian Network popularized the terms Side A, Side B, and Side X to refer to three different theological camps in this conversation



Side A



God makes people gay
God blesses same-sex marriages in the same ways that He blesses opposite-sex marriages
Requires theological maneuvering or a belief that the Bible is not binding/prescriptive for a modern context 



Side B



Same-sex attraction is a result of the Fall
We do not choose who we are attracted to and there is no formula for changing one’s attractions
Same-sex romantic and sexual activity are sins
All Christians are called to vocational singleness or Christian marriage
Christians can identify as gay in limited ways




Side X



Same-sex attracted Christians must reject their attractions and work toward change
Continuing to experience SSA is a sign of willful disobedience
Homosexuality is sinful
God intends for all people to marry someone of the opposite sex

[Notes]
I’ve shared this Side ABX way of describing theological camps on this topics, because I think it’s a helpful rhetorical tool
When you lay these out, you position yourself as the reasonable middle
You reject a progressive sexual ethic that abandons historic biblical wisdom on one extreme
And you reject pray-the-gay-away theology that’s caused 1000s of suicides on the other extreme
You place yourself in the middle, holding on to both compassion and conviction



Honestly, I wish…



But, I can’t ignore the bad fruit of a progressive sexual ethic
Less commitment and more infidelity
My gay Christians friends who adopted a progressive sexual ethic lost their faith

[Notes]
So we’ve explore how God has invited gay people to steward their sexualities
And why we’re convinced that’s God’s wisdom theologically

But beyond theology, there are compelling reasons to follow God’s wisdom as we understand it
You see, even if I could somehow convince myself theologically that God would bless a same-sex marriage between two Christians
I can’t ignore the bad fruit of a progressive sexual ethic in my life and the lives of others

At a 30,000 foot level, the average adult same-sex partnership lasts much shorter than the average opposite-sex partnership
And the rates of adultery and infidelity are much higher in same-sex marriages
Now we can argue whether this is the result of societal oppression, the bad fruit of not following God’s design, or both

More importantly,
most of my gay Christian friends who adopted a progressive sexual ethic stopped believing in God
at first, they did a little bit of theological acrobats to say that maybe Scripture could be read to support same-sex marriages
but after awhile they admitted that the Bible probably says what we’ve thought it has said
So they continue believing that God fully blesses same-sex marriages,
but they just concluded that the Bible is not binding or authoritative for modern people
but once they get to a place where the Bible and the Church can’t tell you who God is
they realize they are just worshipping a God they came up with
and what’s the likelihood that the God of their imagination is real?
and listen, I don’t want that for my gay friends
I want all of them to have robust relationships with God
but the fruit I see of a progressive sexual ethic is my gay friends losing their faith

I’m convinced both by theology and by experience that a traditional sexual ethic is what’s best for me!



Bad fruit everywhere



Gay Christians following Biblical teaching experience bad fruit too.

The Church MUST do better.

[Notes]
But there’s bad fruit of a traditional sexual ethic
my gay Christian friends who are stewarding their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic are lonely, struggle with sin, and this effects their relationship with God and the Kingdom work they could do
And this is because the Church is doing a horrible job teaching about sexual stewardship and loving and serving people like me
I think that’s the double burden of gay Christians: the Church doesn’t know how to love us well, and the alternatives culture offers still aren’t good for us either
And that sucks
yet, that doesn’t make something bad for me good for me
that doesn’t change something from being a sin to edifying to God

why is this the way God made things?
you know, I don’t know
but at the end of the day, it’s not my job to question God or tell Him how to do His job
I’ve just got to trust that God knows what is best for me and obey His teachings

What I do know, is that Christian communities must do this better!

How might your students respond to this nuanced presentation of God’s wisdom for gay people? What would they find compelling? Lacking?
2:29

[Notes]
 
A Vision for Thriving
Become churches where…
Everyone is thinking theologically about their sexuality
Christians talk publicly about the questions gay people face
Every kid knows God’s love and wisdom for gay people
Pastors and lay leaders know how to minister to gay people
Gay people thrive in vocational singleness or Christian marriage

[Notes]
What, then, does it look like to be churches where gay Christians can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic?

First, churches need to invite all Christians to think theologically about their sexual stewardship.
We must teach that God first calls everyone to a period of temporary singleness during which we discern whether we are called to a lifetime vocation of singleness for the sake of the kingdom or a lifetime vocation of Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex.
Our churches should teach that every Christian has the same inherent capacity for both vocations and that every Christian, gay or straight, should offer the question of vocational singleness or Christian marriage to God.
Plus, our churches need to teach that regardless of our vocation, God has made all of us for intimacy in the context of human family, including those called to vocational singleness
 
Second, churches must talk publicly about the cultural questions in the intersection of faith and sexuality.
With compassion and theological accuracy, churches need to explore the following questions:
How does same-sex attraction develop?
What part did God play and why?
Does same-sex attraction change?
How should gay people meet their intimacy needs?
How do gay people fit in God’s story?
How is God’s invitation to gay people good?
As a result, everyone in a church would know how to love gay people well and reflect the love of Christ in conversations about sexuality.
Plus, gay people in a church who are not out yet would know what the church believes and that it is safe to share their story.

Third, churches need to talk about the possibility of same-sex attraction in age-appropriate ways across the lifespan so that teens don’t wait 5 years to tell a parent or pastor and spend 5 years making sense of their sexuality all by themselves with the lies of the Enemy.
Before teens realizes they experience same-sex attraction, teens need to hear that gay people don’t choose who they are attracted to,
that they have nothing to be ashamed about,
that we won’t try to fix them,
that we don’t love them any less,
and that God has good and beautiful plans for them.
Then, when teens realize their same-sex attractions, they would quickly share with their parents and pastors, inviting them to help them learn how to steward their sexuality in God-honoring ways.
 
Fourth, churches must provide effective pastoral care to gay Christians.
They need to do what it takes to gain the competency to provide pastoral care to gay people.
While licensed counselors still may be included to help address clinical levels of anxiety or depression, these churches must recognize that same-sex attractions are not a mental illness to be cured.
Parents and pastors should help gay people integrate their faith and sexuality in ways that lead to thriving in this life and deep relationships with God and friends.

And fifth, churches need to become places where gay people could thrive in vocational singleness or Christian marriage with reasonable effort.
These churches should teach about the theology of vocational singleness in Scripture,
adults should model thriving in vocational singleness and be celebrated in the church,
and the church should invite all people—gay or straight—to discern whether God is calling them to vocational singleness or marriage.
Most importantly, these churches must be places where celibate people can find the same depth of family that married people find, whether that be through intentional Christian communities or living with a married couple.
Then, these churches need to teach about the possibility of mixed-orientation marriages for gay people, cautioning against getting into these recklessly while highlighting the beauty and brokenness of real stories.

That’s just a brief vision of what it looks like to be churches where gay Christians can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic
If we had another hour together, I’d tease out each of those 5 and explore the practical steps your churches can take



If our churches became this kind of community, would a traditional sexual ethic be true + good + beautiful? What are the biggest barriers to becoming this kind of community?

Love & Wisdom



What is God’s wisdom for everyone’s sexual stewardship?
What does that wisdom mean for sexual minority students?
How can we respond when students share about their sexuality?

[Notes]
I want to close with a brief section about how we can respond effectively and compassionately when students do share about their sexuality with you



COMING OUT


[Notes]
How can you respond with the love, wisdom, and patience of Jesus when a student comes out to you?






Don’t assume that they’re convinced of a progressive sexual ethic or are pursuing same-sex romance

Remember that they’ve likely processed privately for years or decades.
When someone shares

[Notes]
Well first, let’s define what it means for someone to come out

Many mistakenly assume that those coming out are not only sharing about their sexual orientation but also making a public declaration of pursuing gay romance and sex.
Do some come out by also sharing about a secret same-sex partner or (not so) jokingly inviting friends to set them up on same-sex dates?
Yes.
But often teens and preteens coming out haven't figured out what they think about relationships or decided how they think God thinks about sexual ethics.
They're just sharing that they're a boy attracted to boys, a girls attracted to girls, or some combination of non-straight experience.

Coming out, then, is a process of privately recognizing and (eventually) sharing with others about one’s sexual orientation (a person's consistent pattern of sexual attractions).
When someone comes out publicly, they've likely processed privately for years or decades.
On average, teens wait five years after internally recognizing same-sex attractions to share with a parent or pastor.







Sharing is risky: a majority of LGBT+ teens still experience bullying and too many are kicked out of their homes. 

Sexuality isn't the most important aspect of personhood, but it’s meaningful. Students share in hopes of being fully known and fully loved.

When someone shares

[Notes]
Coming out is risky for an LGBT+ person, and our response (as Christians) matters.
Historically, coming out was dangerous.
Gay people experienced bullying, family rejection, psychologically dangerous treatments, employment and housing discrimination, and homophobic violence.
86% of LGBT+ teens today experience verbal harassment in their schools.
25% report being physically attacked at school.
Over half of LGBT+ youth fear being disowned by their parents after coming out (with almost 10% actually getting kicked out of their homes).

So why do they come out?
To be fully known and fully loved.
While a person's sexuality isn't the most important aspect of their personhood, it is meaningful.
Until an LGBT+ person shares about this part of their story, they aren't sure where they'll be fully loved when their story is fully known.

Not having to keep one's sexuality a secret anymore can…
alleviate stress,
lead to more genuine friendships,
help teens connect with peers of similar experiences,
and foster healthier intimacy with God.






Avoid words/phrases like
Homosexual
love the sinner hate the sin
gay lifestyle
sexual preference
Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve
When someone shares

[Notes]
Before we get to how you *should* respond, let’s talk about how *not* to respond

If someone shares with you, avoid words/phrases like "homosexual",
"love the sinner hate the sin",
"gay lifestyle",
"sexual preference",
"Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve", etc.
LGBT+ people experience these as inflammatory and unsafe.







Don't ask them to hide their orientation
Don't share w/ others w/out permission
Don't suggest they chose their attractions or they're likely to change
Don't blame the "gay agenda" for their orientation
Don’t make problematic sin comparisons
When someone shares

[Notes]
Don't ask someone to hide their sexual orientation.
Don't share their story with others without their permission.
Don't suggest they chose their attractions or they're likely to change.
Don't blame the "gay agenda" for their orientation
Don’t make problematic sin comparisons like comparing same-sex attractions to alcoholism.







Reassure them that you love them, thank them for sharing, and recognize the risk they took. Practice term mirroring.

Be honest about how this new information changes (or doesn’t change) how you see them.
When someone shares

[Notes]
Okay, so how *can* we respond?
Embody Christ’s love with your response

reassure them that you love them,
thank them for sharing,
and recognize the risk they took.

Instead of letting sexual identity language be a barrier to early conversation,
try using whatever words they use in the ways they use them as an act of hospitality.

Be honest.
If you can say honestly, "I don't see you differently. Nothing has changed," then say that.
Or if it fits better, you can say, "Anytime I learn more about someone, I see them differently, but not lesser.
I see you more fully, and now I want to get to know you even more!”






Listen well by making eye contact, smiling, and listening-to-learn. Offer physical and verbal affection, as appropriate.

Don't ask loaded, high-stakes theological questions during your first conversation. Take your time getting to know this part of a person's story.
When someone shares

[Notes]
If you genuinely want to get to know the person better (and that is welcomed), make an effort to understand their experience at a deeper level.

Listen well by making eye contact, smiling, and listening-to-learn.
Offer physical and verbal affection, as appropriate.

Ohh, and don't ask loaded, high-stakes theological questions during your first conversation.
Or even during your second conversation.
Take your time getting to know this part of a person's story.






Are you feeling/have you ever felt suicidal?
Are you being/ever been bullied or teased?
How have your friends responded to you?
How have Christians responded to you?
Is there anything else you would like for me to know right now?
Do you prefer I share with others or maintain your privacy?
When someone shares

[Notes]
Okay, so someone's shared with you about their sexual orientation for the first time.
You reassured them of your love, thanked them for sharing,
and honored their courage.
You listened well and asked to meet again to get to know the LGBT+ person even more.

Now what?

Here's some good questions for your second conversation:

Are you feeling or have you ever felt suicidal?
Are you being or have you ever been bullied or teased?
How have your friends responded to you?
How have people at church responded to you?
Is there anything else you would like for me to know right now?
Do you prefer I share with others or maintain your privacy?






What does your sexual orientation mean to you?
How do you describe your faith identity?
How does your sexual orientation intersect with your faith?
Are you planning to stay connected at church?
When someone shares

[Notes]
Then perhaps during a later conversation,
when you feel like you've demonstrated that you're safe and earned enough trust to asked theological questions,
try starting with these:

What does your sexual orientation mean to you?
How do you describe your faith identity?
How does your sexual orientation intersect with your faith?
Are you planning to stay connected at church?

Note: these are just suggestions for the *very first* conversations. If you already have or enter into a discipleship relationship with the student, you’d be negligent if that discipleship didn’t include conversation about their convictions and their sexual stewardship. But remember, resistance to a traditional sexual ethic is much more about either (1) not believing a God really exists, (2) not believing that God really knows what’s best for us better than we do, or (3) not believing that we know who that God is by reading the Scriptures with the Church historic

How do you have those ongoing discipleship questions? Start by exploring those three fundamental questions, slowly walk through sexual stewardship for all people, and make space for 10 common LGBT-specific questions that we covered in our lab: LINK






Don’t put the cart before the horse: focus on salvation first

Don’t expect gay Christians to follow God’s wisdom until you’ve made thriving accessible
When someone shares

[Notes]
Ultimately, If the LGBT+ person you're meeting with has made clear they aren't convinced of a traditional sexual ethic
and part of your motivation for getting to know them better is a hope they'll eventually embrace God's full love and wisdom for gay people,
remember this:

God's inconvenient but life-giving wisdom for sexual stewardship seems foolish to those who don't know Jesus.
Don't put the cart before the horse.
Focus first on offering them tastes of Christ's love through your friendship.

If they are Christians but aren't convinced of a traditional sexual ethic,
remember that churches have historically pushed gay people into pray-the-gay-away ministries,
enabled a double standard for gay vs. straight sexual ethics,
and condemned them to loneliness if committed to celibacy.

Better arguments won't convince them of the goodness of God's wisdom.
What will?
How can we offer a winsome witness on these topics in progressive environments?






Recognize the sins of the Church
Offer clarity as a form of charity
Publicly commit to doing better
Cultivate thriving in the lives of Side B gay Christians
Call straight people to sexual stewardship and to consider vocational singleness.
Winsome witness?

[Notes]
First, recognize the sins of Christians in the past
Pray the gay away solutions, double standards for sexual ethics, paltry support of celibacy, and sometimes overt homophobia and hate

Second, offer clarity as a form of charity
Be clear about what you understand God’s wisdom to be for sexual stewardship

Third, publicly commit to doing better and taking practical steps
Be explicit
Tell them what your ministry is going to do differently

And then do it

In particular, I’d encourage you to take the steps necessary to support gay Christians following a traditional sexual ethic in ways that actually bear undeniably good fruit.
Realize that vision for a thriving community that we explored earlier

And fifth, call straight people to a high standard of sexual stewardship and to consider vocational singleness
When we hold straight people to a lower standard of sexual stewardship than gay people, we lose credibility and hurt straight people
And vocational singleness won’t be viable for gay people until a meaningful minority of straight people are accepting God’s call

So keep meeting with sexual minority students who doubt God’s love or the wisdom of a traditional sexual ethic
And outside of those conversations, get busy pushing your community to become a place where they could actually thrive according to God's wisdom
