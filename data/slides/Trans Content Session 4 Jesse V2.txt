Navigating Gender Incongruence &Caring for Trans* People

[Notes]
Welcome back to “Navigating Gender Incongruence & Caring for Trans* People” with Equip.
I’m Jesse White, Equip’s Trans* Content Specialist.
The goal of these sessions is to equip Christian leaders and parents to think wisely and empathetically about gender incongruence.
And to help Christian leaders and parents offer God’s love and wisdom to those navigating gender incongruence and to trans* people,
while those Christian leaders and parents challenge their churches to grow their capacity to support trans* people in compassionate and theologically accurate ways

Last session we surveyed alternate Christian and non-Christian perspectives on gender ethics and shared how you can better care for those navigating gender incongruence in your churches and families
SESSION OBJECTIVES
1. Stories & Terminology
2. The Bible + Theology
3. Culture & Pastoral Care
4. Kids & Case Studies


[Notes]
This session, we’ll zoom in on caring for kids and teens who share about incongruence, and then we’ll conclude our sessions with a series of case studies spanning a range of scenarios you might encounter


Remember, sex and gender…
Sex—Being male or female as defined by chromosomes, gonads, sexual anatomy, and secondary sex characteristics

Gender—Psychological, social, and cultural aspects of being male or female including gender identity

[Notes]
Remember, we’re using the words sex and gender in specific and different ways.

A person’s sex (male or female) is defined by his or her chromosomes, gonads, sexual anatomy, and secondary sex characteristics.
These include the presence or absence of a Y chromosome, internal reproductive organs, external sexual anatomy,
and endocrine systems that produce secondary sex characteristics.

When I refer to someone’s gender, I am referring to the pychological, social, and cultural aspects of being male or female including gender identity
(how you experience yourself and how masculine/feminine a person feels) and gender role (adoptions of cultural expectations for males/females). 



Gender incongruence, trans*
Gender Incongruence – An acute sense that one's gender does not correspond with the experience typically associated with the person's biological sex

Transgender/Trans* – A general term for someone who experiences gender incongruence

[Notes]
When I use the phrase ”gender incongruence”, I’m referring to an acute sense that one's gender does not correspond with the experience typically associated with the person's biological sex.

When I use the word ”transgender” or shortened to “trans” with an asterisk, I’m referring to a general term for someone who experiences gender incongruence.
To be clear, when I use the word trans to refer to someone, I’m not communicating anything about their theological convictions or the extent to which they have transitioned.
I am merely using that word to refer to a person who is navigating gender incongruence.
I’ll use those words and phrases most commonly and interchangeably.



Femaleness, maleness, femininity, and masculinity 
Femaleness/Maleness – the nature of being biologically female or biologically male

Femininity/Masculinity – a person’s sense of being a woman/man and cultural expectations for how women/men will express their gender

[Notes]
When I say “Femaleness/Maleness,” I’m referring to the nature of being biologically female or biologically male.

When I say “Masculinity/Femininity,” I’m referring to a person’s sense of being a woman or being a man and cultural expectations for how men and women will express their gender. Cultural expectations can and often are different between different regions in the same nation, between different nations, and between generations.


KIDS & GENDER INCONGRUENCE

[Notes]
At this point in the training, the parents, kids’ ministers, and youth pastors in the room may be asking,
“But what about our kids? What does all this mean for them?”
How to talk to your children about gender incongruence
For a deeper dive into talking to kids about God’s love and wisdom for sexual stewardship for all people, check out Equip’s Parent Course.

[Notes]
In light Equip’s theological recommendations and general posture toward ministry,
here’s how we would encourage you to engage with this topic with kids:

Also note, this four-session course isn’t focused on kids, so this section will be very brief.
If you’re looking for a fuller seminar on how to talk to young kids about sexual stewardship,
I highly encourage you to take Equip’s Parent Course which includes a full two-hour session devoted to biological sex and gender.
You can find out more at equipyourcommunity.org/ParentCourse.
God intended for them to be their particular biological sex, and that is good
Names, pronouns, and bathrooms don’t have to do with felt gender
To reject cultural gender stereotypes while affirming gender difference
The gospel is primary
Regardless of gender incongruence, teach every kid…

[Notes]
First, some recommendations for what it’s be helpful to teach every kid, regardless of gender incongruence:

Before kids are even old enough to know their own biological sex or gender (which typically happens between 18 months and 3 years of age),
teach them that God made them the biological sex that they are and that their biological sex is good.

(*This advice assumes that the child does not have an intersex condition that makes the determination of biological sex difficult or impossible.)

Teach that names, pronouns, and bathroom usage don’t have anything to do with one’s felt sense of gender.
Our name is given to us by our parents. We use the pronouns and bathrooms associated with our biological sex because they’re a reflection of our biological sex only.

Reject broken cultural definitions of gender while continuing to maintain that males and females are different biologically/physically in ways that lead to differences psychologically/spiritually, and humbly resist the urge to overprescribe what universal, Biblical masculinity and femininity are.

Extra-biblical rules and roles obscure the truth about what it really means to follow Jesus as a boy/man or a girl/woman.
When leaders who think they’ve parsed out all the differences between men and women over-prescribe gender roles or insist men and women follow rigid gender rules, our kids get hurt. 

They either become proud because they think they’re crushing it, or the rules crush them when they can’t live up to them or suffocate under them.
We strive to point to Christ, not prove our gender.

Everything else is secondary to the gospel. It is the gospel that informs how we are to live.

Scripture describes holiness, godliness, and Christian living in universal terms. There aren’t separate lists of commands/virtues for males and females. 

(Side note: none of the gifts mentioned in Romans 12:3-8 or 1 Corinthians 12:4-11 are gendered.) Help them find what they’re passionate about, what relational vocation God may be calling them into, where they best fit into ministry, where they can use their gifts and talents for the kingdom.

Affirm your girls and boys
Affirm that your kids are genuinely girls or boys, regardless of mannerisms, expression, personality, interests, voice pitch, clothing choices, or anything else, because of the body God gave them.

Recognize the ways boys and girls are physically different, but don’t glorify those differences.

[Notes]
Affirm that your boy is a boy regardless of his mannerisms, expression, personality, interests, voice pitch, clothing choices, or anything else,
because the body God gave him is that of a boy.

Affirm that your girl is a girl regardless of her mannerisms, expression, personality, interests, hair length, clothing choices, or anything else,
because the body God gave her is that of a girl.

Speak positively about being a girl or being a boy.
Remind your children often that their bodies are good because God created them, that God was intentional about creating boys and girls.

Boys and girls are inherently different and will have different experiences growing up; culture treats boys and girls differently.
And we’ll need to parent in response to those cultural influences and innate differences.

We teach our boys to love and appreciate their body, but to know that their looks, athleticism, strength, and gifting are not the measure of their worth.
What they are interested in or how they dress doesn’t make them masculine.
They are valuable because God created them, and they are masculine because God created them male.
And we teach our girls to appreciate their bodies, but to know that their looks, their bodies, how they dress, and their interests or skills are not what give them worth. 
What they are interested in or how they dress doesn’t make them feminine.
We teach our girls that their value lies in how they’re created uniquely by God, and that they are feminine because God made them female. 

God is the one who determines and assigns value, and because we are all created uniquely by him, each of us has value that cannot be taken away because we all bear his image. 
If your kids shares about gender incongruence…
Believe your kid if they share about gender incongruence or discomfort with gender expectations
Refrain from shaming your child for preferring gender atypical things

[Notes]
Some of the kids in our homes, some of the teens in our churches are going to experience gender incongruence,
because they feel deeply that they were born in the wrong body.

And some will share more generally about a sense that they don’t quite fit in with current cultural gender norms.

Some youth may try to adopt a trans identity as a way to find community, even if they don’t experience a robust sense that their sex and gender don’t align.

Even if you think your kid’s experience of gender incongruence is mild or a phase, show compassion and care for them well.
Dismissing their experience can bring on pain and even more confusion, and dismissal can result in greater mental health challenges.
Plus, your relationship with the child could be damaged.

So first, have open and honest conversations about gender incongruence. 

Second, avoid forced choice moments:
Don’t force a female child to choose between her family and her preference to wear androgynous clothing;
don’t force a male teen to choose between God and wearing his hair long and painting his fingernails.
Talk about whether cultural gender norms or stereotypes they may feel expected to uphold are actually biblical.

If your kids shares about gender incongruence…
Provide healthier alternatives to puberty blockers and hormonal drug treatments for kids, including addressing any mental health concerns with proven interventions
Encourage kids to delay embracing a concrete trans* identity to avoid mislabeling sources of discomfort/disorientation

[Notes]
Third, provide healthier alternatives to puberty blockers and hormonal drug treatments for kids.
Even some on the radical left have discouraged allowing children to transition due to the short-term and long-term health risks related to puberty blockers and hormonal drug treatments. 

Health risks for puberty blockers include can include stunted height, diminished bone density, headaches, hot flashes, weight gain, mood and emotion alterations,
negative effects on memory and concentration, negative effects on self-control and mental flexibility, negative effect on IQ level, and stunted genitalia.

The health risks associated with cross-sex hormone therapy can include adverse changes in blood pressure and cholesterol, increased risk of heart attack and stroke,
increased risk of blood clots, increased risk of cancer, irreversible changes (like a lower voice for biological females), increased risk of infertility.

Ultimately, a teen navigating gender incongruence is likely dealing with co-occurring medical and/or mental health concerns.
Are they truly in a place to make risky medical decisions that will likely have negative and irreversible consequences?

Instead of considering medical intervention, especially in the beginning and for teens, get help for mental health concerns,
offer teens places where they can make sense of their distress and find belonging, and avoid excessive social media and internet usage.
Ensure their mental health is cared for and help them find and keep solid friendships/community/family.

Socially/medically transitioning as a child or teen and then potentially choosing to de-transitioning after puberty will only add to the distress felt.


And fourth, encourage your teen to delay embracing a concrete trans* identity

To be clear, we don’t make this suggestion because we doubt your child’s undeniable experience.

Instead, we encourage delay because some teens have great difficulty explaining their discomfort/disorientation in puberty and reach out for something to explain and alleviate those feelings.

Enabling kids to hurriedly identify as trans* could enable your child to mislabel the source of their discomfort/disorientation as gender incongruence when they’re not actually experiencing robust feelings of disconnection or distress when it comes to their gender and biological sex, which means that the true source of their distress is masked and goes unaddressed.

Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD)
No trans adolescents were surveyed 
The websites where the surveys were posted were used by parents who openly objected to their child’s transgender identity 
The onset of GD may have seemed rapid from the parents’ perspective 
Conservative parents, political leaders, and church leaders have latched onto this term

[Notes]
Finally, I want to address a topic related to kids and gender dysphoria that has been in the news much more recently: a phenomena called rapid onset gender dysphoria:

In 2016, a professor at Brown University wondered whether social contagion and peer pressure might be the cause for the rising number of teens taking on transgender identities,
despite no prior observable history of gender dysphoria or incongruence.

She posted an online survey on three websites for parents who believed their child had developed symptoms of gender dysphoria,
and began identifying as transgender simultaneously with other kids in their peer groups.

Based on the results of the survey, the professor published a study in 2018 speculating that the rapid onset of gender dysphoria was a “social coping mechanism,”
and the term Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD) was born.

Controversy ensued as criticism of the study’s methodology and conclusions were voiced by clinicians, trans* activists, and researchers,
who pointed out that no trans adolescents were surveyed, the websites where the surveys were posted were used by parents who openly objected to their child’s transgender identity,
and the onset of GD may have seemed rapid from the parents’ perspective only because the adolescents experiencing GD chose not to tell them earlier.

Unfortunately, conservative parents, political leaders, and church leaders have latched onto this term,
and used it to blame the media, LGBTQ+ culture, technology, etc for the growing number of youth identifying as trans or seeking out social/medical transition,
which has led to a wholesale dismissal of the genuine distress and pain that gender incongruence causes.

Those concerned about the study and its impact worry about the damage it has done to those who genuinely experience gender incongruence at a young age.
In short, there’s not enough evidence to support ROGD as a genuine trans experience.
Teen girls with no previous signs of gender incongruence are increasingly identifying as trans*
Often have trans* friends and are more accepted socially after personally identifying
Heavy social media engagement and refusal to address mental health concerns
<1/3 of clinitians address mental health issues before proceeding with hormones/blockers
Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD)

[Notes]
Still there seems to be something to this phenomena:
teens, particularly biological girls, who have shown no signs of gender incongruence or dysphoria are suddenly identifying as transgender in increasing numbers.

They often have several friends who identify as trans and are often more accepted socially after identifying as trans themselves.

These teens tend to have in common heavy engagement in social media and refusal to address other mental health concerns
They seem to be experiencing high levels of distress from several sources and are seeking a solution to and a way to explain their pain.
Thus, they believe that transition will resolve their distress and lead to more social acceptance and belonging.

Unfortunately, less than a third of transition clinicians choose to explore issues of mental health, previous trauma, or any alternative causes of gender dysphoria before proceeding with puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones for teens who present with sudden trans identification.
Recognize instead that kids and teens are vulnerable to a wide variety of outside influence.
Strive to have age-appropriate conversations about gender, sexuality, and mental health all throughout childhood.

Instead of trying to convince your child that they’re not really experiencing gender incongruence or dysphoria,
follow the advice we’ve already shared.

QUESTIONS
If your child was displaying gender atypical mannerisms, expression, personality, interests, voice pitch, or clothing choices, how might you be tempted to respond? How could you respond instead to protect your child from shame?
What might it look like to balance believing kids when they share about gender incongruence while being aware of phenomena like ROGD?

[Notes]
Take some time to review your notes, and then reflect individually or with others on the following questions:
1. If your child was displaying gender atypical mannerisms, expression, personality, interests, voice pitch, or clothing choices, how might you be tempted to respond? How could you respond instead to protect your child from shame?
2. What might it look like to balance believing kids when they share about gender incongruence while being aware of phenomena like ROGD?




CASESTUDIES

[Notes]
 And finally, let’s conclude our sessions with a series of case studies spanning a range of scenarios you might encounter.

16
CASE STUDIES
10-year-old female child who 
Identifies as a Christian 
Has attended your church since birth 
Dresses in boy’s clothes 
Exhibits tomboy preferences 
Has started wondering if she was really supposed to be a boy
Wants to be called by a different name and pronouns

[Notes]
While most of the previous content over these three session has assumed discipleship of a trans* Christian each to submit to God’s wisdom,
real-world scenarios vary.

Consider, for example, the following two scenarios and how you might respond differently based on the circumstances:

First, consider a 10-year-old female child who identifies as a Christian, has attended your church since birth, dresses in boy’s clothes, exhibits tomboy preferences,
has started wondering if she was really supposed to be a boy, and wants to be called by a different name and pronouns.

In response, pastors and parents should not shame the child for her questions or exploration of a different name and pronouns.
They can have nuanced conversations about the brokenness of sex and gender and how we can honor God in the midst of that brokenness.

During this process, pastors and parents may invite or even instruct the child to continue to use her given name and pronouns.

17
CASE STUDIES
40-year-old self-identified woman who 
Is spiritually curious but not a Christian 
Was born a man, now goes by a woman’s name and pronouns 
Uses the women’s bathroom 
Presents as a woman 
Appears to have undergone breast augmentation

[Notes]
On the other hand, consider this second scenario:

A 40-year-old self-identified woman who is spiritually curious but not a Christian, was born a man, now goes by a woman’s name and pronouns,
uses the women’s bathroom, presents as a woman, and appears to have undergone breast augmentation begins attending your church.

Long before any discussion about what bathroom the individual should use at your church, what name and pronoun she should use, or whether to undo her surgery,
years or decades may be spent developing a relationship with the individual and walking alongside her as she develops a relationship with Christ.

Do you see the different between these two difference scenarios and how the first response of Christians leaders is circumstance-dependent?



18
CASE STUDIES
1. A Christian who transitioned and has received nothing but positive affirmation from godly people in their life.

[Notes]
To give you a chance to practice that on your own, I’m going to provide you with a range of case studies.
There are often many complex and varied ways that trans* people have and will continue to interact with the church.
I’m going to read each of these to you one at a time.
Feel free to pause the video and reflect individually or with others on each of the case studies, asking yourself how you might minister with God’s love and wisdom.
Then after you’ve had some time to reflect, I’ll share some of my advice.

A Christian who transitioned and has received nothing but positive affirmation from godly people in their life.

Had a chance to reflect?
Here’s my advice:
Have open, honest dialogue about what this decision means for them and the ways it does/does not honor God. 







19
CASE STUDIES
2. A Christian who was on the brink of committing suicide (maybe had several attempts) and has been told by religious authorities that transitioning is their only hope.

[Notes]
2. A Christian who was on the brink of committing suicide (maybe had several attempts) and has been told by religious authorities that transitioning is their only hope.

Had a chance to reflect?
Here’s my advice:
Address mental health issues and circumstances contributing to these issues first while seeking out gradual steps to mitigate dysphoria

20
CASE STUDIES
3. A Christian who has decided not to follow gracious, wise counsel backed by theological and scientific evidence that transitioning was not a morally right thing to do. This counsel was coupled with sacrificial, loving fellowship and a commitment to walk with the person through alternative ways of dealing with their dysphoria.

Have open, honest dialogue about what it looks like to remain in community and what it looks like for their church community to continue to walk alongside them. 

21
CASE STUDIES
4. A Christian who has decided not to follow religious counsel that was very impersonal, trite, and uninformed. This counsel was not offered alongside any relational commitment, love, or guidance.

[Notes]

Had a chance to reflect?
Here’s my advice:
Have open, honest dialogue about the root of this unloving spirit within leadership/the church.
Tthen seek out any ways to reconnect with the individual, make amends, and pursue an ongoing conversation about community, discipleship, and faith in connection to their incongruence.

22
CASE STUDIES
5. A Christian who transitioned before they came to Christ.

Had a chance to reflect?
Here’s my advice:
Have open, honest dialogue about what it means to reconcile their gender with their faith,
and how the church can walk well alongside them as they discern through prayer and community what this process looks like in their life. 

23
CASE STUDIES
6. A non-Christian who's been coming to your church and is spiritually seeking.

[Notes]

Had a chance to reflect?
Here’s my advice:
Focus on loving them as a person and helping them understand the Gospel.
Be honest with any questions they may have in regard to their gender presentation and faith as well as any other questions they may have about following Jesus.

24
CASE STUDIES
7. A brand-new convert to Christianity.

[Notes]

Had a chance to reflect?
Here’s my advice:
Focus on the basics of discipleship and spiritual growth.
Prayerfully discern with them what it looks like to reconcile their faith and gender and how to honor God faithfully in their life.



25
CASE STUDIES
8. A person (Christian or non-Christian) who has transitioned but now might want to de-transition.

[Notes]
8. A person (Christian or non-Christian) who has transitioned but now might want to de-transition.

Had a chance to reflect?
Here’s my advice:
Help provide them with good resources and support during this de-transition period.
Address any concerns about perceived differences and help ease them into areas of community that may be challenging for them. 


QUESTIONS
What patterns did you notice about your intuitions for responding to a range of scenarios?
What else do you need to confidently and carefully offer trans* Christians God’s love and wisdom? Why might you find that?

[Notes]
Take some time to review your notes, and then reflect individually or with others on the following questions:
1. What patterns did you notice about your intuitions for responding to a range of scenarios?
2. What else do you need to confidently and carefully offer trans* Christians God’s love and wisdom? Why might you find that?






SESSION OBJECTIVES
1. Stories & Terminology
2. The Bible + Theology
3. Culture & Pastoral Care
4. Kids & Case Studies


[Notes]
That concludes our fourth and final session

Thanks for your time and willingness to lean into this conversation for the sake of offering God’s love and wisdom to trans* people

I hope you feel equipped to think wisely and empathetically about gender incongruence,
prepared to offer God’s love and wisdom to those navigating gender incongruence and to trans* people,
and emboldened to grow your church’s capacity to support trans* people in compassionate and theologically accurate ways.
