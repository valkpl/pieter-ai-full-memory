WHY COME OUT?


[Notes]
Pieter

What do people gain from coming out?  If there are devastating risks involved, why not just hide one’s sexual orientation?



Why Come Out?
What is gained from coming out?
Alleviating stress
Honesty
More genuine relationships
Connecting with others who experience same-sex attraction
Healthier intimacy with God




[Notes]
Pieter

-Alleviating stress– constantly worrying about being outed and making sure the mask is always tightly on is very stressful.  “Relief” is one of the most common words I hear gay and lesbian people use after they come out for the first time.
	Wells, a man who experiences same-sex attraction and is a leader in his church said, “Hiding takes a lot of work, way more work than being honest.”
-Honesty--with themselves and others.  Josh said, “To stay in the closet means denying everyone around you the true you.”  Honesty and transparency allow for deeper, more genuine relationships with friends and family.  Being out means that you are seen and known.
-More genuine relationship
	Carl, a man who is out to most of his friends and family, said, “It means the world to me to not have to hide who I am when we go out places.”
-Coming out may be the most commonly shared cultural experience that defines modern gay identity; connecting with others who are “like me” helps, as one gay man put it, “you find your own voice.”
-Authenticity with self, others, and God allows for healthier intimacy with God.  And that’s always a good thing.




RESPOND


[Notes]
Amber

So how do we respond when someone comes out to us?  With love and kindness.  Patience.  Gentleness.  (These are some of the fruits of the Spirit, by the way.)  We seek to respond as we see Jesus responding to others: with genuine compassion.




Christian Response
Some DON’Ts
No biases
No agendas
Don’t ask the person to hide
Don’t out the person
Don’t suggest that “change is possible”





[Notes]
Pieter

Now that we know a bit more about language and how important our words are, let’s look quickly at some DOs and DON’Ts.  We’ll start with the DON’Ts.

-No biases – gay people are more than their attractions; engage them as a whole person
-No agendas – Jesus didn’t spend time with people to “get them saved”; he spent time with them to show them the Father’s heart toward them.
-Don’t ask the person to hide his or her sexual orientation
-Don’t out the person without permission
-Don’t suggest that the person can change their orientation or “pray away the gay” - studies show that orientation change, even among those who try, is extremely rare.  I don’t know anyone whose attractions have ever moved from gay to straight.




Christian Response
Some DON’Ts (continued)
Don’t imply that experiencing SSA is a choice
Don’t blame the “gay agenda”
Resist making sin comparisons
Let go of hang-ups
Avoid asking loaded questions





[Notes]
Pieter

-Don’t imply that a person is choosing to experience same-sex attraction - sexual orientation is very complex, but people don’t just wake up one day and decide to be attracted to people of the same sex
-Don’t blame the “gay agenda” for someone’s orientation
-Resist making sin comparisons; they just don’t work, and they’re often offensive.
-Let go of hang ups – “What if my friend is attracted to me?”  “What if they think I’m actually affirming?”  Just let go of those.
-Avoid asking loaded questions, especially about faith or theology



Christian Response
Some DOs
Cultivate relationship
Listen well
Be curious
Show affection
Strive to express acceptance
Secure a system of support





[Notes]
Pieter

And now for some DOs

-Cultivate relationship by being invitational - invite them to share a meal or coffee to be “with me”.  Josh, an out man who is not a Christian, said, “I think if a Christian invited me over for dinner and attempted to cultivate a friendship that would help me feel validated and heard.”
-Listen well – make eye contact, smile, genuinely listen.  
-Be curious – be sincere as you draw out their story in their own words.  One man who experiences same-sex attraction said, “Don’t pretend you have all the answers or understand what they’re going through.  Every story is different.”
-Show affection – as appropriate, offer physical and verbal affection
-We should strive to express acceptance, even while holding on to our beliefs: “I love you.  I will always love you. I am so thankful you told me. You are very brave. I am going to walk with you no matter what.  I really want to hear your whole story.” Parents can add “This is your home and we are your family – always!” (GF, p28)
-Tyler, an out man, said, “Extend belonging without expectation.  Help them thrive - they’re already battling so many other issues during such a tumultuous time.”
-Help your non-straight loved one secure a system of support. Parents, other family members, pastors, counselors, mentors, peers (depending on age, allow  but do not encourage peer support; immature peers sometimes gossip, tease, or reject). Teens and young adults who have strong systems of support have better long-term mental and emotional health outcomes.





Christian Response
Potential follow-up questions
How have your friends responded to you?
How have people at church responded to you?
Is there anything else you would like for me to know right now?
Do you prefer I share with others or maintain your privacy?





[Notes]
Pieter

When someone comes out to us, even if we think we’re well-prepared, our minds can go into panic mode, “What do I say now???”  Here are some potential follow-up questions that are appropriate to ask.



What about theology?
Clarity is honoring
Avoid bait-and-switch experiences
If Jesus is our King and we believe He knows best for us, then we’d be wise to submit everything to Him
God will probably ask for that eventually, but for now, God cares much more about the relationship




[Notes]
We might be tempted to lead with theology.  But the moments after someone comes out to you is not the time for theological discussion.  Many of us fear we might be dishonoring God by not letting the person know up front what we think about same-sex sexual behavior.  We also fear that not leading with our theology might give someone the impression that we’re condoning, approving, or enabling same-sex sexual behavior.

AND, if we hide our beliefs or the beliefs of the church, we are setting gay people up for a bait-and-switch experience. Countless gay people have told me that they would rather know from the beginning that a church holds more traditional beliefs than investing for years assuming their church held more progressive beliefs.

Ultimately, clarity is honoring to gay people.
If we are in a pastoral/mentor role with the individual, I think it is helpful to be clear from the beginning that if Jesus is our King and we believe He knows best for us, then we’d be wise to submit everything.
We should share that a traditional sexual ethic is probably how God thinks about this, so the individual shouldn't be surprised if He eventually asks for the individual to follow a traditional sexual ethic.
But God cares much more that the individual knows Him and grows in depth of relationship with Him.
So that should be the focus, not sexuality.
If God truly has a certain perspective on this, the Bible, the Holy Spirit, and mentors will make it clear.
You don't want to give the individual a false impression that God is ambivalent about sexual ethic. But, the first focus should be on Jesus.



Healthy Conversation
Honoring questions about beliefs
What does your sexual orientation mean to you?
How do you describe your faith identity?
How does your sexual orientation intersect with your faith?
Are you planning to stay connected at church?




[Notes]
Pieter

So, when it IS appropriate to have a more theological conversation, here are some honoring questions you can ask about beliefs: 
What does your sexual orientation mean to you?
How do you describe your faith identity?
How does your sexual orientation intersect with your faith?
Are you planning to stay connected at church?

How have your experiences responding to queer people’s stories confirmed or challenges these suggestions?

Is clarity honoring? Or an unnecessary barrier? Why?



PASTORAL CARE


[Notes]
Advice from my work serving LGBT+ people in counseling contexts



WHAT’S
THE SAME?




What’s the same?
Feel Feelings & Think Thoughts




[Notes]
just like any client
they need to fully feel their feelings
core emotions of anger, sadness, fear, and joy
believe that emotions are good: they communicate to us
there are no bad emotions, only painful ones
feeling can never be avoided, only postponed
they need to be in touch with their thoughts
if not aware and in control, our thoughts will drive our experience
perception is reality, so taking hold of our thoughts can change reality

all people need to feel and think



What’s the same?
Feel Feelings & Think Thoughts
Achieve Congruence




[Notes]
just like any other client, achieving some level of congruence is important
Congruence = our desires, beliefs, and actions match
but also like any other client, we won’t always find complete congruence between our desires and beliefs, and we shouldn’t force that upon clients
for most all of us, we hold some tension between our wants/drives/desires and beliefs/values



What’s the same?
Feel Feelings & Think Thoughts
Achieve Congruence
Meet Intimacy Needs




[Notes]
we are all created for intimacy
we all have a need for connection and attachment—to know others and be known
and we all have physical, spiritual, and emotional needs
there’s debate about whether we have a need for sex, or just a need for physical, spiritual, and emotional intimacy
but regardless, sexual and gender minorities have these needs like anyone else
and if we don’t meet our needs in healthy ways, our flesh has a way of grabbing for lowest hanging fruit that is often destructive and unsatisfying
helping those clients identify their intimacy needs and meet them in healthy ways is powerful



Turn & Talk




To what extend have you seen this among gay people you’ve ministered to?

How does recognizing the sameness between queer and straight people affect your confidence in ministry?



WHAT’S
DIFFERENT?




What’s different?
Studies show higher rates of these among sexual and gender minorities:
Anxiety
Depression
Suicide
Body Shame




[Notes]
what do we do with this information?
don’t be surprised if you find it, and be competent in serving



What’s different?
Higher amounts of shame

Depending on the individual’s beliefs: reject shame altogether or replace with a healthy view of self and guilt




[Notes]
shame is a powerfully negative experience among those who have spent a lifetime hiding
those who have spent a lifetime hearing the world say they are bad or different or weird
and they start to believe that they are bad
multiple ways to push back
if believes homosexual activity morally neutral, then want to wholly reject shame
if believes homosexual activity a sin, replace shame with guilt and healthy view of self




What’s different?
Acute need for freedom
To share their story
From shame or fear or hiding
To identify with others
To advocate with others




[Notes]
acute need for freedom (model the relationship in counseling) 
between men and women I know who experience same-sex attraction and gender identity questions, no correlation between seeking romantic/sexual relationships or not and happiness, strong correlation between freedom with story/being out and happiness



What’s different?
Psychosocial developmental delays
College sophomores who are 19 years old but at the psychosocial development of a 13 year old
Identity formation




[Notes]
developmentally delayed because of societal block 
“psychosocial developmental delays" 
ex) moving countries and learning a new language 
identity formation (everyone needs it but these clients in particular)



Turn & Talk




How do we responsibly act on this awareness of the differences?

How can we both honor with clarity and accommodate people in process?
