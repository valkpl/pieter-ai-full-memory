CARING FOR

LGBT+ STUDENTS

[Notes]
Thanks for the opportunity to dive into this conversation with all of you






Academy Care Plan



Recognize harm against LGBT+ people and offer clarity as charity
Equip teachers to support LGBT+ students
Train an LGBT+ Student Care Team to provide long-term discipleship
Garner buy-in from local Christian leaders
Guide parents to have ongoing conversation
Educate students and encourage them to seek support

[Notes]
First, underpinning every conversation leaders and teachers have with parents and students will be a recognition of the harms against LGBT+ people
In particular, pray the gay away solutions, double standards for sexual ethics, paltry support of celibacy, and sometimes overt homophobia and hate
Often perpetrated by people who called themselves Christians
And a desire to share clearly about God’s love and wisdom for gay people
as a form of charity
Queer people and increasing all people prefer for Christian leaders to be clear in respectful ways about what they believe rather than intentionally or accidentally carrying out a bait-and-switch

Second, the Academy will equip teachers to care for LGBT+ students according to God’s love and wisdom
That’s what we’re beginning today!

Third, the Academy has already assembled a small group of Academy leaders, pastors, and counselors to receive more extensive training to provide long-term support and discipleship to LGBT+ students

Fourth, in the coming weeks and months, the Academy will meet with Christian leaders in local church to gain their support and hopefully to encourage them to adopt similar practices of biblical compassion

Fifth, sometime next Spring the Academy will coach parents on these topics and prepare them for ongoing conversations with their students

And last but not least, sometime next spring, the Academy will educate students about sexual stewardship for all people, including LGBT+ students
Encourage LGBT+ students to reach out for support if that tis their story
And take sexual stewardship seriously for all students, including wisdom around dating
