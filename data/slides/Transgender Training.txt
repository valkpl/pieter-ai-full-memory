LOVING

TRANS PEOPLE




[Notes]
How can we think theologically about gender, sexedness, femininity/masculinity, and gender identity questions? In application, how can we compassionately walk alongside transgender people who seek to flourish through God-honoring stewardship of their gender identity? These are the kinds of questions EQUIP wants to help pastors, parents, transgender people, and everyday Christians think about well so that the Church can become a place where transgender people can belong and thrive in obedience to God.

disclaimer about this not being my experience and a compassionate orthodoxy seeming elusive

STORY


[Notes]
We are going to hear stories of Christians who identify as transgender so we can better understand their lives, experiences, motivations, etc. and better empathize with the challenges they face

You are going to see people who have transitioned in different ways and make confident statements about God’s opinion about that—please try your best not to let that distract you and try to imagine being in their shoes

Let me be clear: the purpose of showing the video is not to express EQUIP's views or give guidance on responding to people who come out as trans in the church, but to give participants a window into the life of trans people and to provoke thought/discussion.

What did you hear? What were some common elements of their stories?



23

[Notes]
What did you hear? help me plot out 
things I heard
we dont expect people to be trans
people know they are trans from an early age
and they ask God to fix it
didnt fit in when younger, and increasingly disconnected going through puberty
no sense of self, felt unauthentic, negative impact on spiritual, mental, and physical health
faced with a forced-choice moment: deny trans experience in every way or leave your church
great loss socially and spiritually, depression
unsure themselves what the right decisions are
when rejected by the church, when relationship is broken, nothing to tether them to stewarding gender in inconvenient ways
all this led to alienation from God
many Christians who are trans pray and study deeply before making decisions and believe they have consult God and gotten the green light
while we may disagree with their decisions, can help but be thankful that they have weathered the experience and integrated God into their experience and have deeper relationship
for many trans Christians, they never give God a second chance
we need a diversity of perspectives and brokennesses in the Body of Christ
the big question: what does it look like for a Christians who faces gender identity questions to live into that faithfully?




Share
How many of you have ever felt like you have fallen short of masculine/feminine expectations? But did any of you ever question whether you were supposed to be a boy or a girl? What if you genuinely did? What if there was an undeniable sense that your sex and gender didn’t match? How difficult would that make life?






Share
How difficult would life be if you felt like you were weren’t right at a core level? If growing up you never felt like you belonged among the girls or the boys? If you faced huge developmental challenges because of your experience? If you faced one of the highest rates of suicide and hate crime among any American sub-population?



27

[Notes]
32% to half of trans people attempt suicide
Trans people are 4.5 times more likely to be murdered than the general population



Share
How difficult would life be if you read in the Bible that God makes people male or female but you feel like you are neither?  Do you think that would make it hard for you to love a God who allowed this to happen?






Share
What if every time you got ready, every time you introduced yourself, every time you went to the bathroom, etc. you felt like you were living a lie?

What if someone asked you the following: How does dating work? When did you know? Have you had surgery? What was the surgery like? What do you do when you need to go to the bathroom? Do you have a penis?

THEOLOGY


[Notes]
What are sex and gender? What were God’s intentions for them? What did He prescribe? What did He leave for us to define? 
Answering these questions better prepare us to minister to transgender people. 



Working Definitions
Sex – chromosomes, gonads, sexual anatomy, and secondary sex characteristics

Gender – psychological, social, and cultural aspects of being male or female including gender identity and gender role

Transgender – a person whose gender experience differs from the gender associated with their biological sex






He created them male and female…
Intimacy, diversity, and complementarity in the Trinity (John 1)

God created sex and gender as one source of diversity and complementarity, and marital relations are one form of intimacy (Genesis 1&2, 2 Corinthians 13:14, 1 Corinthians 12, Genesis 2:18)




[Notes]
God created humankind in His image to be beings-in-relation to each other, to desire communion with God and others, and to be diverse and complementary



He created them male and female…
The Church has historically taught that to be a male or female is to accept
Your maleness or femaleness
Your created potential to relate in that way to the other






He created them male and female…
Or in reverse, we can reject our sex or gender in one of the following ways:
Reject your maleness or femaleness outright (genital mutilation)
Engage in sex outside of the covenant of marriage
Engage in marriage covenants with individuals of the same sex




[Notes]
Beyond this, what can we know with certainty about sex and gender? Which preferences and experiences have to do with our maleness or femaleness? To what extent has God defined universal femininity and masculinity?



Unfortunately, all is broken
God first imagined each of us perfect, including our maleness or femaleness (Genesis 2; Psalm 139)

But we are all corrupted at a genetic level and developed in a broken world (Psalm 51; Romans 5)

Our sex is broken at a genetic level and our gender is influenced by broken cultural concepts of gender




[Notes]
As in the case of the thorn in Paul’s side, being faithful Christians doesn’t mean that God resolves all of our brokenness in this lifetime.



Unfortunately, all is broken
There are only three examples of perfect maleness or femaleness in the Bible: the Garden before the Fall, Jesus, and prophecy about the New Heaven and New Earth

All other examples in the context of a broken world and often unclear: universal prescription of perfection or accommodation? (Philemon, Webb, William, Slaves, Women, & Homosexuals)






Unfortunately, all is broken
What if God did not intend to define gender completely but instead left some of that up to Man? (Genesis 2; Roberts, Christopher C., Creation & Covenant, 146)




[Notes]
difficult to prescribe what correct gender is beyond those previously described: to accept one’s maleness or femaleness, to accept one’s created potential to relate in that way to the other, and to refrain from rejecting one’s maleness or femaleness



Man’s definition of gender
Our society attributes many preferences to gender that have nothing to do with gender (Hirsch, Debra, Redeeming Sex, 87-88)

There are more differences within a random group of men or women than there are between the average man and the average woman (Yarhouse, Mark, Understanding Gender Dysphoria, 37)

Gender is only one of many sources of diversity in the Body of Christ




[Notes]
Pink and blue

difficult to define statistically significant differences between men and women categorically



Man’s definition of gender
Broken gender leads to forced choice moments: either reject your preferences or continue your preference and experience shame (in both)

How much of gender identity questions is caused by ascribing unrelated preferences to gender?

Don’t deconstruct gender, but do purge it of broken cultural prescriptions




[Notes]
What happens when we ascribe something to gender that has nothing to do with gender? Say a boy is born with a preference for the color pink and prefers pink toys, clothing, and blankets. Parents often respond with a forced choice for the child



Man’s definition of gender
Scripture never addresses an individual that:
Genuinely experiences gender identity questions
Is clearly biologically male or female
Isn’t exhibiting same-sex sexual behavior, cross-dressing, or genital mutilation (1 Corinthians 6; Deuteronomy 22 & 23)




[Notes]
When Christians talk about the Bible and gender, they often site passages that forbid same-sex sexual behavior, participating in rituals practiced by other cultures (genital mutilation), and cross-dressing…

What do you believe the Bible describes as universal masculinity and femininity?
To what extent has the wider culture informed our American Christian concepts of masculinity and femininity?
“Broken gender leads to forced-choice moments: either reject your preferences or continue your preference and experience shame (in both)” – When have you seen this?

UNDERSTAND


[Notes]
Appreciating common terminology and progressive worldviews about gender can help you better respond to and care for transgender people.




Understanding Trans People
<1% of the population identifies as transgender (Yarhouse, 92)
Straight, gay, bisexual, asexual, polysexual, pansexual, etc.
Some have taken some steps, others have completely transitioned, and others continue in their dysphoria
Identify as one gender, neither, both, or somewhere in between






Share




What terms are new to you?
Which are you most comfortable with? Least comfortable?
Were you aware that intersex people exist?
Why do you think the trans community pushes against the term “gender dysphoria”? 
52

[Notes]
Take some time to read each of these definitions
I don’t provide these to validate these ideas or say that these are the final definitions
Only to give you a sense of what people mean when they use these words



Progressive Worldview




Two Camps:
Affirm gender binary but believe they were born into the wrong body
Reject gender binary and any distinction between men and women

Contradictory “solutions”, so how should a Christian respond?

[Notes]
Advocates for this perspective, such as Caitlyn Jenner, want to preserve the distinction between men and women while allowing people to conform their bodies to their gender.

seeing them as arbitrary labels that ignore the wide range of genders along a spectrum

One seeks to maintain the gender binary while the other seeks to deconstruct it.



Progressive Worldview




A Christian Response:
Reject broken, cultural definitions of gender
Continue maintaining that male and female are different biologically/physically in ways that lead to differences psychologically/spiritually
Humbly resist the urge to over-prescribe what universal, Biblical masculinity and femininity are

[Notes]
MYSTERY and PARADOX

How does there being “two camps” of progressive worldviews on this topic make a Christian response difficult?

Does the Christian response outlined seem orthodox? Nuanced? Robust?

MINISTER


[Notes]
How can a Christian who experiences gender identity questions steward those in God-honoring ways? How can pastors and parents compassionately walk alongside transgender people seeking to submit these questions to God?



Minister Well




Respond on a case-by-case basis using the following principles:
Recognize lack of choice
Accept enduring brokenness
Get to know the individual’s story
Approach marriage wisely
Apply church disciple consistently
Navigate identity carefully

[Notes]
Less than 1% of the population identifies as transgender, and among those there is a great diversity of experiences. Because of this infrequency and variety, churches should resist one-size-fits-all responses, but instead respond on a case-by-case basis using the principles described below



Recognize lack of choice




No one chooses gender identity questions

What do transgender people have to gain from the significant distress most endure?

Gender identity questions are a reflection of broken sex and gender

[Notes]
Rebellion is rarely a primary source of gender identity questions for a transgender person with persisting, genuine cross-gender identification. Many transgender people endure significant distress due to their gender identity questions—why would they choose that?



Accept enduring brokenness




We do choose how we steward our brokenness

Resolve what you can, manage what you must

All of us will experience enduring brokenness in this lifetime (2 Corinthians 12:7-9)



Get to know the individual’s story




Gender identity questions can flow from multiple of the following:
Intersex Condition
Rejection of Cultural Gender
Psychological Wounds
Perceived Brain-Sex/Body-Sex Difference

Provide support according to sources

[Notes]
Appreciate the individual’s story, understand the sources of gender identity questions, and support the individual accordingly



Get to know the individual’s story




Intersex Condition
Often unclear whether God intended the individual to be male or female
Admit that we cannot know God’s intentions
Humbly walking alongside as the individual seeks how God is leading them to steward



Get to know the individual’s story




Rejection of Broken, Cultural Gender
We’ve ascribed preferences to gender that have nothing to do with gender
A transgender person may be rejecting those broken, cultural definitions, not their maleness/femaleness
Join them in resisting over-prescription of universal masculinity/femininity while maintaining a distinction between men and woman

[Notes]
These individuals are not rejecting their sex, they are not mutilating their sex, and they are not participating in relationships contrary to their sex. But their presentation, style, and interests may contradict expectations of their gender



Get to know the individual’s story




Psychological Wounds
Preference for something ascribed to gender but unrelated -> (1) reject preference and internalize shame + rejection or (2) reject gender and experience overt shame + rejection
Identify experiences of shame + rejection, cast out messages, replace with dignity and beauty of God’s creation

[Notes]
Regardless of how the individual responds, broken gender leads to people broken by shame and rejection



Get to know the individual’s story




Perceived Brain-Sex/Body-Sex Differences
Genuine experience of mind/soul/spirit not matching body
Primary conflict internal and difficult
Transgender people who conform to cultural gender expectations make daily, unavoidable, and painful choices that feel alien and reject their genuine preferences

[Notes]
The Church is not asking those who experience same-sex attraction to change their attractions—we are only asking them to refrain from same-sex sexual and romantic activity. But you cannot ask a transgender person not to have a name, not to use pronouns, not to go to the bathroom, not to wear clothes, not to have a pitch to their voice, not to groom their hair, not to go through puberty, etc.



Share




How frequently have you seen the following among Christians? How does this nuance empower you to minister?
Rejection of Cultural Gender
Psychological Wounds
Perceived Brain-Sex/Body-Sex Difference
1:10



Approach marriage wisely




Not ineligible for marriage but encourage to discourage experiences and related challenges early in meaningful relationships



Apply church discipline consistently




“I know it when I see it” is not just—you must have a clearly stated policy of gender expression based on orthodoxy of universal masculinity/femininity AND you must apply church discipline around other areas of brokenness



Navigate identity carefully




Encourage to share their story and navigate challenges in the Body of Christ
Source of spiritual growth (finding meaning in suffering), offer the Body of Christ a unique perspective, and enjoy community with others of similar experiences
For these reasons, identifying with experience may help integrate with primary identity as a Christian



Application?




Respond on a case-by-case basis using the following principles:
Recognize lack of choice
Accept enduring brokenness
Get to know the individual’s story
Approach marriage wisely
Apply church disciple consistently
Navigate identity carefully

[Notes]
So how do we apply these principles?



Application












[Notes]
Along the spectrum of actions some transgender people take (shown below), pastors and parents should resist rushing to define which constitute rejection of one’s maleness or femaleness for all people.



Application




Resist rushing to define what constitutes rejection of one’s maleness or femaleness

Consider:
To what extent is the individual Christian?
How meaningful is your mentoring relationship with the person?
To what extent does the person submit to the authority of his or her church?



Application




Example 1: Consider a 10-year-old female child who identifies as a Christian, has attended your church since birth, dresses in boy’s clothes, exhibits tomboy preferences, has started wondering if she was really supposed to be a boy, and wants to be called by a different name and pronouns.
How could you respond?
1:18

[Notes]
Pastors and parents should not shame the child for her questions or exploration of a different name and pronouns. They can have nuanced conversations about the brokenness of sex and gender and how we can honor God in the midst of that brokenness. During this process, pastors and parents may invite or even instruct the child to continue to use her given name and pronouns.



Application




Example 2: Consider a 40-year-old self-identified woman who is spiritually curious but not a Christian, was born a man, now goes by a woman’s name and pronouns, uses the women’s bathroom, presents as a woman, and appears to have undergone breast augmentation. 
How could you respond?
1:22

[Notes]
Long before any discussion about what bathroom the individual should use at your church, what name and pronoun she should use, or whether to undo her surgery, years or decades may be spent developing a relationship with the individual and walking alongside her as she develops a relationship with Christ.
