Lead Team Training
Ethos Church – Session One
EQUIP Nashville

[Notes]
For the next hour and a half, we are going to make our way through session one of lead team training. As was mentioned in my pre-session email, this is the first of three sessions with you, the lead team, aimed at equipping you and kicking off this initiative at Ethos Church. Later, I will share how these three sessions that make up lead team training fit into the large initiative at Ethos.
Session Goal & Objectives
EQUIP Nashville
Goal: 		build initiative consensus

Objectives
Need and Challenge
Solution and Strategy
Expectations
Terms and Beliefs

[Notes]
The goal of this first session is to build consensus in this room around this initiative at Ethos. My hope is that we can get on the same page going forward, that we can rally around the same mission and goals for Ethos, that we can establish your buy-in with this initiative.

We will do this in four ways. First, we will visit the need and challenge that you have already expressed exists at Ethos Church and in the city of Nashville. Second, we will unite behind a solution and strategy. Third, we will discuss expectations to clarify our roles and responsibilities in this initiative. And fourth, we will have a conversation about the terms we use when we talk about same-sex attraction and our beliefs are about same-sex attraction.

Now, at first glance it doesn’t look like this session contains a lot of practical content for ministering to those with same-sex attraction. While I think you will find meaningful content in today’s session, I want you to look at this session not as a setup for the rest of lead team training but as the setup for this entire initiative at Ethos Church. It is imperative that we embark on this with unity and clarity of purpose and strategy.
Introduction
EQUIP Nashville
Another "Well-intentioned" Christian on my sexuality, funny how every time this happens I feel a little more ambivalent to the words; they don't sting as much anymore… 

[Notes]
A couple months ago I read the following post on one of my friend’s Facebook wall. For anonymity’s sake, I will call him John. John wrote:
 
“Another "Well-intentioned" Christian on my sexuality, funny how every time this happens I feel a little more ambivalent to the words; they don't sting as much anymore:
 
[Note: The “well-intentioned” Christian wrote her message in ALL CAPS and no periods, for emphasis, we can assume. Or perhaps she didn’t know how to use a computer and accidently had her caps lock on. Or maybe she thought all caps is the way Christians type in the whispery praying voice.] 

The rest of the message containing the woman’s words for John is included in your packet. Take 5 minutes to read the Facebook message on your own, and then we will discuss it.

Discussion
EQUIP Nashville
What were your impressions?

What did you agree with?

Did the woman say anything that made you uncomfortable?

[Notes]
Normalize conversation about these things. Say what they need to say and don’t be afraid to say the wrong thing. This is learning process Use what you know—goal of session to equip you with language and understanding

So, now that you have read the “well-intentioned” Christian’s Facebook message to John, what did you think?
What were your impressions?
What of what the woman said did you agree with?
Did the woman say anything that made you uncomfortable?
Did she seem to have good intentions?
Did she seem to understand John’s situation?
Did she communicate what she wanted to say in a loving way?

Introduction
EQUIP Nashville
Good Intentions
Limited Understanding
Consented to attractions
Cannot be both gay and Christian
Sin worse than others
Poor Delivery
Praying for emotional distress
Knowing what is best for someone else
No sympathy or apology
Public on Facebook

[Notes]
It wounds like we are in agreement that the woman probably had very *good intentions, but her *understanding was limited and her *delivery was poor. 
 
*She insinuates that John chose or consented to being attracted to men. *The woman suggests that someone cannot be both gay and Christian. *She seems to believe that homosexuality is on some other level than other sin—even using the word abomination. *Our “well-intentioned” Christian tells John that she is praying that he would have emotional distress until he changes. *She says, “Even though you don’t see it I know what is true for you and God will eventually get past your sin”. *There is a lack of sympathy for John’s circumstances—no recognition of the ways he has been harmed by the church, no apology for the hate in our world, no mourning the wounds that brought him to where he is. 
 
*Again, its not that the things the “well-intentioned” Christian believed were wrong but that she chose to say those things and said them publically over Facebook.
 
Such is the case with most of us in the Church—we have the right intentions—we love, truly. But we don’t really understand same-sex attraction and we don’t know what to do when we encounter someone with that experience.

Discussion
How did you respond?
 
What did you say or do?
 
Do you think you responded adequately? 

What do you wish you knew?
EQUIP Nashville

[Notes]
So, what are your stories? In the past, when a friend or family member shared with you that he or she experienced same-sex attraction or that someone close was dealing with that, *how did you respond? *What did you say or do? *Do you think you responded adequately? *What do you wish you knew? I’d love to hear your stories.

EQUIP Nashville
Need and Challenge

[Notes]
It seems evident from all of our stories that the Church needs a better understanding of same-sex attraction. Nashville needs churches that know how to love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction. 

Need
EQUIP Nashville
3 to 5% of the US Population

24,000 in Nashville (out of 600,000)

120 at Ethos (out of 3,000)

1 for every 3 House Churches (out of 30)

[Notes]
Or, if stories aren’t as motivating for you and you are a numbers guy like me, consider how many individuals experience same-sex attraction or identify as LGBT in Nashville, at Ethos, and in our House Churches. Studies have argued that somewhere between 3 and 5 percent of the US population fit in this category. That means that in Nashville, a city of 600,000, over 24,000 people experience same-sex attraction or identify as LGBT. On Sundays, out of the 3,000 people that attend one of our services, more than 120 people are like John from the Facebook message earlier or are like me. If House Churches average 10 regular members,1 out of every 3 House Churches contain a member who experiences same-sex attraction or identifies as LGBT. In one year, 1 out of every 3 House Church Leaders need the understanding and know-how to love and serve these individuals, and it’s not unreasonable to assume that over a decade, everyone single House Church Leader will encounter this.
Challenge
EQUIP Nashville
Overwhelming topic
Politics
Friends and Family
Theology

Varied personal experience

[Notes]
We know there is a need, but for many, this *topic can be overwhelming especially since it is so often conflated with *politics, *people we know personally, and *important modern theological discussion. You are in good company. What I have for you during these sessions comes from a decade of study and experiences and the wisdom of countless mentors, theologians, therapists, pastors, and friends. You will not walk out of these sessions with all of your questions answered, but I am confident that you will possess the stories, principles, and tools needed to continue learning, loving, and serving. 
 
*Some of you have been doing life with those who experience same-sex attraction for many years, and you have already learned how to love them well. I am excited for you because this initiative at Ethos provides you the opportunity to solidify what you know and to do more to serve those that you love. But, most of you, even if you have close friends with these experiences, still feel inadequate at some level. I want to affirm how normal that is. Growing up in East Tennessee, I went to a Christian summer camp for 10 or 11 summers in a row. It was where I accepted Christ as my personal Lord and Savior, and it was where much of my theology and relationship with God was formed. I consider the founder and president of this camp to be in my top-5 list of spiritual greats in my life. So, you can imagine that I was surprised when less than a year ago, this man called me to learn from me. He knew that I experienced unwanted same-sex attraction and that I was studying to serve people around this issue, and he called saying that when a close family friend of his recently turned to him for love and support around this person’s struggle with homosexuality, my spiritual great, despite decades of being a part of leading thousands to Christ, had no idea of what to say or do. This is all to say that if you are in the same boat as the founder and president of the Christian camp, the boat is large and the occupancy is many. And please, if you are in that boat, do not feel shame for being there. It is an easy place to be, and truly, for someone who does not experience same-sex attraction, these things can seem unknowable. What is important is that you have made the decision to be here today and to learn.

EQUIP Nashville
Solution and Strategy

[Notes]
Yes, there is a need and yes it is a challenging one to meet, but I believe we at Equip Nashville have the right solution and strategy for the city of Nashville and for Ethos Church
Solution
EQUIP Nashville
To equip the Church in Nashville with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction

50% of churches in Nashville in 50 years

[Notes]
Our mission at Equip Nashville is to equip the Church in Nashville with the understanding and tools to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction. We believe that to do this, we need to reach a large number of churches; but to be effective, we need to spend individual time with each church. *Our goal is to reach 50% of the churches in Nashville in 50 years—and you are the beginning.
Solution
EQUIP Nashville
To equip Ethos Church with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction

[Notes]
Thus, our solution for you is to equip Ethos Church with the understanding and tools to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction. 
 
And I have to say, I am ecstatic that we have embarked on this mission and it has started here at Ethos. Same-sex attraction has been a part of my story, and I am excited about what I will get to share with you over these three sessions because it is the training I wish my church had when I was growing up. And, the fact that I get to start this at my home church for the past 4 years in the city where I first started sharing my story and ministering to peers at Vanderbilt—it could not feel more right.

Solution
EQUIP Nashville
Designed specifically around strengths of Ethos

Designed to be accessible to a wide audience at Ethos

[Notes]
To address this need at Ethos Church we at Equip Nashville have designed an initiative specifically for Ethos to employ your strengths as leaders and as a congregation to achieve significant growth. *This was also designed to be accessible to a wide audience—this is not just for the politicians, theologians, or psychologists.
Strategy
EQUIP Nashville
To equip leaders at Ethos to serve those who experience same-sex attraction
To affect a culture shift among the congregation around their understanding
To empower you to take ownership of this initiative at Ethos

[Notes]
This initiative at Ethos Church has three objectives: *(1) to equip leaders (both Lead Team and House Church Leaders) at Ethos Church with the knowledge and tools to serve those who experience same-sex attraction—we want to give you the understanding and skills so that you can more effectively minister to those in your church; * (2) to affect a culture shift among the congregation around their understanding of same-sex attraction and homosexuality so that they can be better friends and family to those who experience same-sex attraction; and *(3) to empower you as leaders at Ethos Church with the resources and confidence to take complete ownership of ministering to these individuals in your church so that you can continue to serve these men and women long after this season at Ethos.

[Notes]
*The initiative will be in four stages to accomplish those objectives. *Stage one of the initiative is Lead Team Training—that’s what we are beginning today. *Stage two will be Lay Leader Training. *Stage three will be Congregational Education. *Stage four will be Ministry Hand-off. 

How long do I think this will take?

[Notes]
*In stage one, Lead Team Training, our goal is *to equip you with the knowledge and tools to minister to those who experience same-sex attraction at Ethos, as well as *begin to build your ownership of this initiative. 
Strategy
EQUIP Nashville

[Notes]
As I mentioned earlier, today is Session One of three of Lead Team Training. Today, we are building a consensus around this initiative at Ethos. During our next session, we at Equip Nashville will provide you with the foundation to minister to those who experience same-sex attraction by sharing with you the testimony of someone who experiences same-sex attraction, describing 8 common factors of the development of same-sex attraction, and discussing how to have a conversation about the morality of homosexuality. And finally, during the third session, we will provide you with some practical advice and tools as to how to minister to someone who experiences same-sex attraction.
Strategy
EQUIP Nashville
To provide House Church Leaders at Ethos with similar training and ownership
Lay Leader Training
2

[Notes]
*In Stage Two of this initiative, Lay Leader Training, our goal is to *to equip house church leaders with similar training and ownership to what is provided to you during Lead Team Training. House Church leaders are your first line of defense, so to speak. They interact with more members of our congregation on a weekly basis that you as a Lead Team could ever hope to meet with in an intimate way. Providing these leaders with the understanding and skills to be friends with and minister to those who experience same-sex attraction will have a significant impact. As well, I think you will see over these three sessions that this isn’t rocket science, so I am confident that at least at some level, House Church leaders can gain the knowledge and tools needed. Your role in this second stage will be to help decide what content to share with House Church leaders, and I want your help leading that training. We will discuss the details of this more when we have finished Lead Team Training.
Strategy
EQUIP Nashville
To provide understanding to those who do not experience same-sex attraction

To shift culture of congregation

To connect with those who struggle with same-sex attraction and are seeking help
Congregational Education
3

[Notes]
*In Stage Three, Congregational Education, our goal is *to provide understanding to those who do not experience same-sex attraction for the purpose of *shifting the culture at Ethos around these issues. What we want to do is to change how we think about same-sex attraction, what vocabulary we use, and how we love those in our lives that experience same-sex attraction. This will be in the form of a Grow Class open to all at Ethos Church. Just as with Stage Two, Lay Leader Training, your role in Congregational Education will be to help decide what content to include in the Grow Class and to help lead the Grow Class. This Congregational Education will also provide an opportunity *to share our contact information directly with those in attendance, including those who might struggle with unwanted same-sex attraction and are seeking help. But again, this will be designed for those who do not experience same-sex attraction, so while those attending that experience unwanted same-sex attraction will find the content hopeful, it is not for the purpose of ministering to those who experience same-sex attraction. There are, however, two ways that we would like to directly serve those who experience same-sex attraction, which I will come back to after we discuss stage four.
Strategy
EQUIP Nashville
To empower leaders at Ethos to take ownership of ministering to these individuals
Ministry Hand-off
4

[Notes]
*Speaking of which, Stage Four is Ministry Hand-off. While this is the last stage of this initiative, it is really an ongoing stage that begins today. Our goal is *to bring you as leaders to a place of confidence and ownership that Ethos Church can sustainably continue to equip and serve its congregation with minimal support from Equip Nashville. We will do this by making you an integral part of every stage, selecting the content and helping lead Lay Leader Training and Congregational Education. We need to give you opportunities to exercise the things you will learn to build that confidence, and your church needs to see you front and center at each of these stages so that they know that this is something Ethos Church is committed to.
Strategy
EQUIP Nashville
Resource Liaison

Reading Materials
Professional Counseling
Local Small Group
Ethos Support Group
Additional Resources

[Notes]
*There are two additional resources that we want to provide that can be implemented anytime after this first stage, Lead Team Training. The first is for us at Equip Nashville to serve as resource liaisons, meeting with those seeking help that are referred to us by you or by House Church Leaders. From there, we will share our stories, listen to their stories, offer encouragement, and connect them with resources based on their needs and interests. These resources include reading materials, professional counseling, local small groups, and *a support group exclusively for members of Ethos. 
Strategy
EQUIP Nashville
Ethos Support Group

Biblical teaching and prayer
Closed and confidential
Secondary place of community
Additional Resources

[Notes]
*The second additional resource we at Equip Nashville want to provide is a support group for those with unwanted same-sex attraction. Now, I’ve been a part of a couple of these kind of groups and I’ve observed groups like AA and SA. What they all have in common is that while they provide a safe place for those who need the support of people who experience the same thing, these support groups often pull people away from their church. People start living two lives: one with their newfound friends in the support group where they talk about what is really going on in their lives and feel accepted and one with their longtime friends and family where they continue with the same level of detachment and fear. This support group at Ethos will not be that. First, we will provide content-rich, Biblical teaching and healing prayer. Second, it will be a closed, confidential group. And third, and most importantly, it will be a secondary place of community. We will make it clear from the start that you cannot be in this support group unless you are already in a House Church and that the purpose of the support group is to give you teaching and encouragement but to send you out into your community and your House Church to do the real work. 

This support group will serve men with unwanted same-sex attraction, but if other needs arise, we have the capacity to provide content around all issues of sexual and relational brokenness. We are seeking a female counterpart to most adequately serve women who experience unwanted same-sex attraction.

Your role in this will be to help shape the content for the Support Group and to help lead the Support Group.

EQUIP Nashville
Is this worth it?

[Notes]
Read outloud

I argue that the better question is “What are we already losing?” When you think about the people you know who experience same-sex attraction, do you think this is true? Imagine all of their talent and courage and intelligence working toward the Kingdom. What do you think?
EQUIP Nashville
BREAK

[Notes]
Alright, let’s take a 5 minute break. Take this time to use the bathroom and write down thoughts or questions you want to remember for later. If you have any questions for me that you have been saving, feel free to grab me.
EQUIP Nashville
Notes, Questions, 
and Clarifications

[Notes]
Don’t tell them to raise their hand. Tell them to just jump in

Before the break I highlighted the need for a Church in Nashville that better loves and serves those that experience same-sex attraction, and I shared with you how Equip Nashville hopes to do that in our city and at Ethos. 
 
For the rest of today’s session, I am going to clarify expectations, and then I will share with you the terminology used by Equip Nashville and our beliefs as a ministry. I will say more later, but I will share these terms and beliefs to be clear about what I mean when I use certain terms and to be transparent about my perspective—it is not necessary for you to use the same definitions or adopt my beliefs.
 
Notes, Questions, and Clarifications
 
Now, before we start again, I want to invite you to take notes during our sessions and to write down any questions that you want to remember to think about later. If you have any questions during our sessions that it would be helpful for me to address during our time together, please do not hesitate to ask. As well, during any part of our sessions, if I am sharing something and the ways I am saying something doesn’t make sense or you would just like for me to explain the concept in a different way, just raise you hand and waive it. I will gladly pause and make sure that we are all understanding. As I have mentioned, our chief goal here is your understanding, so it is more than worth out time to make sure things make sense.

EQUIP Nashville
Resources

[Notes]
Additionally, I want to take a moment to point out the Resources Guide in your packet. There is a list of books that have been recommended to me, some of which I have read. If you find anything in them that seems incongruent with your theology, feel free to talk to me about it. There are a number of local support groups in Nashville unaffiliated with churches that I could recommend on a case-by-case basis, but as noted, our goal is to start a support group at Ethos. For those dealing with any kind of addiction, Bethesda Workshops here in Nashville is a great resource. For those looking for a therapist in Nashville, I strongly recommend Thaddeus Heffner in Brentwood.
EQUIP Nashville
Expectations

[Notes]
Next, let’s talk about expectations. 

Expectations
Equip Nashville
Equip leaders at Ethos Church with knowledge and tools to incorporate in ongoing ministry
EQUIP Nashville
Ethos Church
Mentoring and crisis management
Readiness to answer questions
Help lead later stages of initiative

[Notes]
This project at Ethos is not something that we at Equip Nashville want to run at Ethos with your blessing, but rather our goal is *to equip Ethos with knowledge and tools to incorporate in your continuing ministry. *As such, mentoring, discipleship, and crisis management will continue to be your responsibility throughout this process as we work to equip you with greater knowledge and tools to love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction. *Part of your ownership of this ministry at Ethos will be your readiness to respond to difficult questions concerning Ethos’ position on gay marriage, homosexuality, and healing of unwanted same-sex attraction. *Another way the lead team can take ownership of this ministry will be to help lead Lay Leader Training, Congregational Education, and the Support Group.

Expectations
Equip Nashville
Share personal beliefs
Share broad principles and skills

EQUIP Nashville
Ethos Church
Define own beliefs
Contextualize teachings
Support decisions before congregation


[Notes]
We will equip you with understanding and tools so that you can do the work of the Church. *We will share with you many of our personal beliefs that influence our perspective, but we do not expect you to adopt our beliefs. *We will share with you broad principles and skills, but we will not give you a prescription for what this should look like in your context. It will be your responsibility *to define your own beliefs as a church, *contextualize these teachings, and *support your decisions in front of your congregation.

I should also be clear that this initiative is designed to equip Ethos with the understanding and tools to love and serve all whom experience same-sex attraction, regardless of how they have chosen to act upon those feelings. Still, our sessions will not include training on the dynamics of ministry unique to those in the gay lifestyle.


Expectations
EQUIP Nashville
Questions Equip Nashville cannot answer:
How should parents respond to gay teens?
Should gay marriage be illegal?
Should our church marry gay couples?
Should gay persons be allowed in leadership?
How should we respond to transgender and transsexual people?

[Notes]
*Here are some questions that we cannot answer:
*How should parents respond to gay teens?
*Should gay marriage be illegal?
*Should our church marry gay couples?
*Should gays be allowed in leadership?
*How should we respond to transgender and transsexual people?
 
I can comment with my personal opinion on each of these, but they are questions that you need to answer for yourself as a lead team and as a church. Many of the principles discussed in this presentation will be helpful to give you an understanding of where they are coming from so that you can approach these questions wisely. I will also provide you with respectful language to use. But, ultimately, I can’t make these decisions for you. I know these are hard questions and important ones, so let me reassure you that these three sessions of Lead Team Training will give you the understanding to answer these questions, if you haven’t already.

Also, I am sure you are all surprised to hear that what we will deliver will not be perfect. It will not be exhaustive. We will not have an answer for every scenario. There will be things that when we look back a decade from now, we will realize that we spoke inaccurately. But, we are confident that much of what we have to share God has for you, and we trust that the Holy Spirit will give you the wisdom to filter out the rest.

Encourage them ot sit in the tension of not having these answers yet
This is about understning and skills—not finishing debates

Expectations
EQUIP Nashville
Large Impact beyond just those who experience same-sex attraction
catalyst for greater intimacy and vulnerability for everyone at Ethos

Broad Application to any issues of sexual and relational brokenness
greater confidence to minister to those who don’t experience same-sex attraction

[Notes]
That last slide sounded like a lot of “can’t, can’t, can’t”, but rest assured, this will be well worth Ethos Church’s investment of time because this initiative will have a *large impact beyond just those who experience same-sex attraction and *the understanding and skills that you will gain will have broad application. I have been a part of a number of Christian communities and witnessed what happens when that community starts to talk about same-sex attraction in better ways and those who experience this feel safe enough to share with others. Without fail, these have served as catalysts for greater intimacy and vulnerability among all demographics in those communities. When we start talking about one issue loaded with shame, bringing it into the light and freeing individuals from that heavy burden, other issues seem more approachable. When someone who experiences same-sex attraction share about his life in a house church, it will invite others who don’t experience same-sex attraction to share about those things shame has forced them to keep secret. Moreover, while what we have to share with you is specific to same-sex attraction, so much of it is true of any sexual and relational brokenness. Not only will you be confident that you can love and serve someone who experiences same-sex attraction, but you will feel greater confidence in approaching issues like pornography, sex outside of marriage, adultery, divorce, sexual addiction, sexual abuse, codependency, and gender/identity issues.

Discussion
EQUIP Nashville
How would you answer these questions?
How should parents respond to gay teens?
Should gay marriage be illegal?
Should our church marry gay couples?
Should gay persons be allowed in leadership?
How should we respond to transgender and transsexual people?


[Notes]
Now I said that I couldn’t answer these questions for you, but I’d love to give you a chance to answer them—a chance for us to discuss them. How would you answer these questions?
How should parents respond to gay teens?
Should gay marriage be illegal?
Should our church marry gay couples?
Should gay persons be allowed in leadership?
How should we respond to transgender and transsexual people?

Not only they would answer but also how do these questions make them feel? Uncomfortable? Unable?

Note: If you would find it helpful, we can find a time outside of these sessions for me to facilitate a time for you as a lead team to arrive at the answers to these questions for Ethos.
EQUIP Nashville
Terms

[Notes]
From what I have shared already, you probably have an idea of what we at Equip Nashville believe and what we mean when we use certain terms, but particularly for someone who is seeking to understand these things for the first time, it will be helpful for us to be clear about what we mean when we use certain terms and transparent about our beliefs. Again, I encourage you as a team to agree on your own terms and define your own beliefs, although I do suggest you give what I have to say strong consideration.
Terms
EQUIP Nashville
Enable understanding vs. Create barriers

Controversy



If in doubt, mirror




Gay
Lesbian
Bisexual
Homosexual
Same-sex attracted
Gay celibate Christian
Ex-gay
Faggot



[Notes]
I should also note that the words we use to describe who a person is or what a person does can create barriers. That is not the goal here—our goal is to clarify terms to enable better communication and understanding. 

But there’s a history of problematic terms. Here are some of the terms that people use to describe individuals who are sexually attracted to the members of the same sex: gay, lesbian, bisexual, homosexual, same-sex attraction, Gay celibate Christian, ex-gay, and faggot. Just from the understanding you brought with you today, what do you know about these terms? How can these be controversial ways to describe someone?

So obviously, this gets very complicated. My suggestion is that when you are having a conversation with a person who experiences same-sex attraction, listen to the words they use to describe themselves and others around them. Perhaps ask them what they mean when they use certain terms, and then mirror what they use. That will make the person feel much more comfortable.
 
Nevertheless, I have to use something, so here is a list of the terms I use and what they mean to me so that you know what I’m saying during these sessions.
 
(ask participants to read definitions aloud)

Terms

Unwanted Same-Sex Attraction (Unwanted SSA)

attraction (physical, emotional, relational, etc.) to people of the same sex in a way that is a corruption of natural desires for healthy intimacy with people of the same sex and identified as unwanted

[Notes]
Unwanted Same-Sex Attraction (Unwanted SSA) – attraction (physical, emotional, relational, etc.) to people of the same sex in a way that is a corruption of natural desires for healthy intimacy with people of the same sex and identified as unwanted

Same-Sex Attraction (SSA)

a term that more generally refers to attraction to people of the same sex as described above that the person may or may not identify as unwanted

[Notes]
Same-Sex Attraction (SSA) – A term that more generally refers to attraction to people of the same sex as described above that the person may or may not identify as unwanted

I use this term as my general term to refer to anyone who is attracted to persons of the same sex, regardless of whether or not they are seeking romantic and sexual relationships with persons of the same sex. Two things to note: This is a person-centered term. I don’t say, “Hey, look at that same-sex attracted” or “Look at that SSA”. It wouldn’t even make sense to use it that way. It’s always “a person who experiences same-sex attraction”. The other thing to note is that some people in the gay lifestyle might find this term offensive. This term is sometimes used by orientation change proponents toward whom there is a lot of animosity in gay culture. People in the gay lifestyle also find it offensive because they find much of their identity in being gay, so they can’t imagine why someone wouldn’t want to claim the label gay.

There’s also debate among Christians who experience this but see it as unwanted as to how they should refer to themselves. Some call themselves gay celibate Christians while others say that they struggle with unwanted same-sex attraction. My personal opinion, and why I refer to myself as same-sex attracted, is that the word gay has such strong connection to gay culture and practice of which I am not a part of that it doesn’t really describe me. Self-described gay celibate Christians use the word celibate to modify gay to distinguish that they are people who don’t engage in same-sex sexual and romantic relationships, but it also communicates that they experience this and it will not change so their only option is celibacy. That is not my opinion either. I don’t think just because you experience same-sex attraction that you have to be celibate. I think for some, Christian marriage between a man and a woman will be a reality.
Terms
EQUIP Nashville
Opposite-Sex Attraction (OSA)

attraction (physical, emotional, relational, etc.) to people of the opposite sex, acting upon which is appropriate in specific contexts

[Notes]
Opposite-Sex Attraction (OSA) – attraction (physical, emotional, relational, etc.) to people of the opposite sex, acting upon which is appropriate in specific contexts

We will talk about this more in Session Two, but I think I should mention here that SSA and OSA are neither opposite sides of a switch, nor are they even opposite ends of a continuum. SSA and OSA exists on two separate sliding scales from non-existent to intense.

Homosexual Activity

[Notes]
Homosexual – a person who practices a lifestyle of homosexual activity

I don’t use this word because it isn’t person-centered, but I wanted to include it because this is how I would define it if I did use it. This word has gained a particularly shaming, religious connotation.

Beliefs

[Notes]
Now, let me share with you the beliefs with which I enter into these discussions. Again, I am sharing these so that you know where I am coming from and that my motivations, so to speak, are transparent. You don’t have to believe what I believe, and I encourage you as an individual, as a lead team, and as a church to form your own beliefs. As well, you don’t have to believe what I believe for the next two sessions of lead team training and for that matter this entire initiative at Ethos Church to have an impact.

I also think it is important for me to note that I have developed these beliefs from Biblical study, general and specific, personal experience, my graduate studies in psychology, the input of mentors, theologians, pastors, and counselors, and observation of the lives of other who experience same-sex attraction.
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
Same-sex attraction is a condition of temptation, but to be tempted is not to sin. 
Matthew 6:12-13
James 1:14-15
Hebrews 4:15

[Notes]
We believe that same-sex attraction is a condition of temptation, but to be tempted is not to sin. 

What do I mean by condition? Same-sex attraction doesn’t just show up one day. We will talk about this more in Session Two when we discuss 8 common factors in the development of same-sex attraction, but it looks like to me that this is something Satan has been working on in my life for a while, and it feels less like and external attack and more like a host of insurgents or an infection that has taken its time to settle and and cause trouble.
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
The Bible defines homosexual activity as a sin. 
Romans 1

[Notes]
We believe that the Bible defines homosexual activity as a sin. 

Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
God created us for perfect intimacy with Him and His family.
Genesis 3
Acts 2
Colossians 2:2

[Notes]
We believe that God created us each for perfect intimacy with Him and His family, but our sin separates us from God and cheapens the intimacy we share with others. To have intimacy needs is good and normal, and we can either satisfy those needs in healthy ways or in unhealthy, sinful ways. For some, romantic intimacy can be enjoyed in the context of Christian marriage between one man and one woman as a reflection of God’s love for His Church.

What do I mean by intimacy? I use the word intimacy in a general way, not to specifically refer to sexual intimacy but to generally refer to the closeness that exists in friendships, romantic relationships, and our experiences with God. Perhaps you could define it as the activity, expression, or interaction of love: intimacy is love in action. This involves a certain level of trust. The word means “to state or make known” so literally to be intimate with someone is to know them and to let them know you. I break down intimacy into physical intimacy, spiritual intimacy, emotional intimacy, and relational intimacy between which there is overlap.
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
A person who experiences same-sex attraction will find greatest joy and peace by seeking healthy intimacy.

[Notes]
We believe that a person experiencing same-sex attraction will find greatest joy and peace by seeking healthy intimacy within the context of friendship and by seeking an understanding of their struggle through prayer, through Bible study, and in the context of life-giving community. 

I have seen this in my life and the lives of friends who experience same-sex attraction. The reality is, everyone in life is broken, and we can’t make pain or temptation go away entirely. The purpose of life is to enjoy the good things God has for us, and that is what God wants for us.
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
No change for some

Slight to significant change for others

Christian marriage between one man and one woman for some

Celibacy for others

[Notes]
*As some follow God’s leadership in this area of their life, they will see no change in their same-sex attraction or opposite-sex attraction. *For others, they may see a slight or significant decrease in their same-sex attraction. *For some, marriage between a man and a woman may be a possibility, *while for others, God gives the gift of celibacy. 

Believe me, every person who experiences same-sex attraction wishes that if you just worked harder or prayed harder, these things would go away. That’s just no how it works.
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
God has promised anyone who seeks Him transformation of the heart and mind and provision of joy and peace.
Ezekiel 36:26

[Notes]
For the person who seeks the Lord and His will for his or her life earnestly regarding this issue, there is no guarantee of change in the person’s sexual attractions, but we are promised that God will transform our hearts and minds to bring us greater joy and peace. 

This is perhaps the most important of our beliefs. Our hope for those who experience same-sex attraction in Nashville is not to fix them all or get them all married to persons of the opposite sex. Our hope is that all of them enjoy this transformation and provision.
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
No one chooses to be attracted to the same sex, but every person chooses how he or she responds.

[Notes]
There are many factors that could have been involved in a person’s development of same-sex attraction, and it is important to recognize that while the individual did not choose to be attracted to the same sex, the person can choose how he or she responds.

There is no amount of discipline and faithfulness that I could have possessed in middle school that could have kept me from developing same-sex attraction. It’s here and it’s not my fault and it’s so unfair. But still, I have a choice as to how I respond. I am the master of my own life. I am in control. I can be who I want to be.
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
Any sin can separate us from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all.
John 1

[Notes]
We believe that when a person commits any sin, he falls short of God’s glory and that sin separates him from God. But, Jesus Christ suffered the punishment for all sin, past and future, such that if any person recognizes his sinfulness and need for a savior, believes who Christ is and what He did, and receives God’s gift of salvation, he will have eternal life.
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
The best healing happens within the context of the Body of Christ.
1 John 1:9

[Notes]
We believe that the best healing happens within the context of the Body of Christ, and that for members of Ethos, the best healing will happen if a person is invested in the community at Ethos through the opportunities provided.

We are created for intimacy, so healing for broken intimacy is going to happen through healthy intimacy and that requires other people. Ask any therapist, and regardless of what the person is in therapy for, if they are leaving therapy sessions and jumping into community and working out their stuff, they are so much more likely to accomplish their goals.
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
Professional psychology and psychiatry may have a place in some people’s journey, but not all

[Notes]
We recognize that professional psychology and psychiatry have a place in some people’s journey but not all.

I personally saw a therapist for two years, but it alone would not have been sufficient and I am convinced that it was not entirely necessary. The reason why I am advocating that the Church in Nashville should be equipped with this understanding and skills and not just advocating that we identify everyone that experiences same-sex attraction and then pay for them all to see therapists is because I think most people don’t really need a therapist. Most people who experience same-sex attraction aren’t experiencing psychological stress or dysfunction to a level that necessitates professional counseling. I think most people just need a Church that knows how to love and serve them well.
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
Silence and shame from the Church has harmed individuals who experience same-sex attraction.

[Notes]
We believe that one of the greatest harms done to individuals experiencing same-sex attraction has been silence and shame from the Church. 

This has been true in my own life, and it only takes a quick google search to hear countless stories to corroborate this assertion. We know that in all things, silence and shame lead to secrecy and literally hand Satan power to use against us.

Put in order from most to least important
Beliefs
EQUIP Nashville
God has called the Church to love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction.
Hebrews 13
Acts 2: 42-47

[Notes]
We believe that God calls the Church to provide people with a loving and supportive community that recognizes their pain, encourages them along their journey with God concerning these issues, provides teaching and accountability, and meets their needs for intimacy.
