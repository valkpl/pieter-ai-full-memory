experience same-sex attraction and am committed to a traditional sexual ethic
brother’s part of my journey
loved well as I figure out
supporting shared story with fraternity
build a culture safe to talk

Andrew asked share reflections
increasingly evident need for a Church that does this better

what I wish my friends had known
a consistent and patient posture toward sexual minorites
what I wish my friends had known
Not born with it but also didn’t choose it
What to expect from the future
I felt angry
I felt alone
I felt confused
I was just like them
a CONSISTENT and PATIENT posture

[Notes]
Our approach is neither consistent nor patient with the Holy Spirit
What if this was how we thought about this topic?
How would it change our effectiveness?
CONSISTENT posture
Created for perfect intimacy with God and His family
Intimacy needs normal and good
Neither marriage nor sex promised or necessary to meet needs

[Notes]
3 fundamental theological concepts that serve as the foundation for a conversation about sexuality

God creates Eve, Jesus when tempted and in garden, in Heaven

must meet in healthy ways or will meet in unhealthy ways

What if we all knew how to meet our intimacy needs outside of sex and marriage?
The Blessing of Singleness (really)
Every person is first called to singleness
Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges
CONSISTENT posture

[Notes]
benefits of singleness
and regardless of whether marriage later, all people should learn to do this well first

How would this change the way we think about friendship and meeting our needs?
The Uniqueness of Christian Marriage
One man and one woman before God
Reflection of intimacy and complementarity in trinity
Centrality of procreation
Responsibility and commitment
CONSISTENT posture

[Notes]
called out of singleness into marriage

vocation to raise children for kingdom

If we knew how to meet our intimacy needs outside of sex and marriage
If we did singleness well and had a robust culture of singleness
If those who got married truly committed themselves to what marriage is
Essentially, if we asked everyone to steward their sexuality in inconvenient ways
Would what we ask of SSA persons be inconsistent?
people don’t care about our theology
people care if we are offering something BETTER
what we SHOULD offer
Accurate theology about marriage
Nondiscriminatory application of Scripture
Shame-free church to talk about experience
Robust culture of singleness
Spiritual friendship to meet intimacy needs
Complex understanding of gender

[Notes]
