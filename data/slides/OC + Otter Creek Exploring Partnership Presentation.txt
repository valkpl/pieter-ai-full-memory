Training Goals
Cast a vision for serving LGBT+ people according to Otter Creek’s beliefs
Share a strategy for realizing that vision and how EQUIP could help Otter Creek accomplish that
Sample what EQUIP can provide by learning how to individually walk alongside LGBT+ people 



15



Otter Creek’s Beliefs
The Bible defines marriage between a man and a woman
The Bible names same-sex romantic/sexual activity as sin
People do not choose who they are attracted to
There is no formula (prayer, counseling, etc.) for changing one’s orientation
God calls the Church to love those who experience SSA regardless of what their journeys look like
God loves LGBT+ people and He values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ






Otter Creek’s Beliefs
God calls non-married people to live celibate lives to the best of their ability under the guidance of the Holy Spirit
Churches can (and should) support civil rights for LGBT+ people (including marriage) under the protection of the U.S. government/legal system as part of the Judeo-Christian affirmation of the imago Dei
Otter Creek welcomes all people into the family to live out their calling and passion

Likely questions
Questions Side A gay Christians are asking:
I am in a same-sex romantic relationship. Can I marry my partner at Otter Creek? Can I volunteer in the nursery? Can I place membership?
If not, how can I really believe you and God love me if I am treated like a second-class Christian?
Shame on you—beliefs like these lead to higher rates of gay teen suicide.






Likely questions
Questions Side B gay Christians are asking:
You say that marriage is a beautiful gift from God but then say it’s not available to me—how is that fair?
Do you believe God made a mistake with me?
How could a loving God allow me to be broken like this and not heal me?






Likely questions
Questions Side B gay Christians are asking:
If prayer and/or counseling don’t work, what can help me?
What do you expect me to do with my attractions?
I am lonely—what do I do with that?
Do you expect me to be celibate? Do you honestly think this is a church where people can do celibacy well?






Likely questions
Questions parents, grandparents, and friends are asking:
How are we communicating this to our youth? What resources are we offering them?
As a parent of a gay child, I do not want to go here if you believe these things.






Likely questions
Questions parents, grandparents, and friends are asking:
As a parent of a gay child, I agree with you, but how do I do this well?
Can we talk about this more? I want to be able to share about this with my friends in a way that is reasonable and compassionate.
