FOUNDATION


[Notes]
tease out a complex and compassionate theology of intimacy and sexuality that invites all of God’s people to inconvenient, life-giving stewardship 



Background



Adolescence is a time of Physical, Cognitive, and Social Development

Teens are asking questions:
Who am I?
Where do I belong?

[Notes]
Info from Mark Yarhouse book









Background



Adolescence is a time of Physical, Cognitive, and Social Development

Teens are asking questions:
Who am I?
Where do I belong?

[Notes]
No less true for SSA
Doesn’t have to be more challenging for SSA if we provide understanding + tools to navigate well and we support them well
We will see that we cannot wait until a youth comes out to us to provide this understanding and tools



Sexual Identity Development



Stage One: Identity DILEMMA
Recognize they experience same-sex attraction and are different than peers (12 to 14)
“How do I make sense of how I feel?”
“What does it say about me that I find this person attractive?”

[Notes]
Want to share with you typical milestones + timing for SSA teens
First, to demystify the mind of SSA teens
But also to inform how we ought to approach these questions in youth ministry

Whats going on
Typical age
What questions they are asking



Sexual Identity Development



Stage Two: Identity DEVELOPMENT
Experiences of behavior, disclosure, labeling, and relationships
Same-sex sexual behavior (16 to 17)
“What would it mean if I was sexual with this person?”
”Would I like it? Regret it?”



Sexual Identity Development



Stage Two: Identity DEVELOPMENT
Labeling of oneself as gay/lesbian/bisexual (17 to 18)
“How do I name my reality?”
Disclosure to another person (17 to 18)
“Who can I trust with what I am experiencing”



Sexual Identity Development



Stage Three: Identity SYNTHESIS
Achieved stable identity that reflects how person experiences self, how wants to be known by others, and congruent with beliefs and values
Ongoing relationship with the same sex (15 to 18)
“How can my needs for intimacy be met?"



Sexual Identity Development



Recognize they experience same-sex attraction and are different than peers

Same-sex sexual behavior

Labeling of oneself as gay/lesbian/bisexual

Ongoing relationship with the same sex

Disclosure to another person
12 - 14
16 - 17
17 - 18
15 - 18
17 - 18

[Notes]
What do you notice about all of these?
milestones happen in high school
college is too late!
parents dont know what they’re doing!
Disclosure is the last step



Pump the brakes



Many Christians who experience same-sex attraction did not have those milestones
Only 26% reported engaging in same-sex sexual behavior
Only 11% labeled themselves as gay/lesbian/bisexual
Only 18% were in ongoing same-sex relationships

[Notes]
SSA Christians haven’t given up or given in
Don’t throw in the towel for them
Not hopeless
So what do we do?



So what do we do?



How youth make sense of their attractions often determine what path they will take:
Assuming same-sex attractions means you are gay often leads to accepting a gay identity
Christian sexual minorities that see same-sex attractions as broken adopted a gay identity and engaged in behavior significantly less often



So what do we do?



Because milestones occur before disclosure, our ministry cannot be reactive:
Preemptively talk about these questions and provide answers
Build trust and openness with how we talk about this topic
Be patient as youth make sense of these questions when they do share

Deep dive: designing programming for youth and parents



Turn & Talk



What surprises you about the average ages for these milestones?

What barriers are there to engaging these questions preemptively across the lifespan?

Two Narratives



Culture offers a narrative that affirms the worth of LGBT+ people and provides a solution—a story where LGBT+ people fit

[Notes]
While our churches are silent on the topic, culture is not



Two Narratives



Culture’s Narrative
Same-sex attractions are at the core of a person’s identity, you are born that way, and acting upon those attractions is only normal.
Those who experience same-sex attraction and deny this are only hurting themselves



Two Narratives



We must offer an alternative that is compelling, affirms people’s worth, recognizes their challenges, and offers the goodness that only God can provide



Two Narratives



If we don’t, silence and shame…
I am different
I am bad
I am not worthy of intimacy
I cannot trust them
I must hide

[Notes]
people will continue to seek out a Gay-cultural narrative if they don’t find a good identity narrative in their church community—one that fully addresses their questions and struggles



God’s Narrative



We are all broken and none of us are how we are supposed to be (Ecclesiastes 7:20)
Same-sex attractions are a reflection of the Fall and they are only one facet of a human’s personhood (Romans 8:20-28)

[Notes]
Broadly, what does it look like to talk about this preemptively?



God’s Narrative



God seeks to redeem all things for our good and His glory (Ephesians 1:7, Galatians 4:7)
Sexual stewardship can bring spiritual growth, meaning to suffering, identity in Christ, and community with others (1 Peter 4:10)

[Notes]
BUT we have to offer this across the lifespan, before they disclose SSA



The Big Question



What makes a sin sinful?
Arbitrary lines? No
Fun-killer? No
That which will hurt us


[Notes]
more specifically, we have to answer the Big question of why same-sex romantic/sexual activity are sins
And what God has made us for



The Big Question



What makes a sin sinful?
Is it honoring to God? (1 Peter 4:10)
Is it harmful to self or others? (Matthew 7:12)
Is it habit forming? (1 Corinthians 6:12)
Is it helpful to self or others? (Romans 13:10)


[Notes]
anal bleeding
Excretion
lose control of bowel movements
Higher risk of colon cancer

Prevalence of HIV infection
alcohol and substance abuse
Suicide
infidelity

Bad fruit of oppression or sinful behavior?
Problematic argument

Really need to start with Scripture



The Big Question



Preponderance of Biblical support
Same-sex sexual activity is sin (Romans 1; Leviticus 18:22; Leviticus 20:13; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10)
Marriage defined between man and women (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-5)
Context of rape, incest, adultery, or sex outside of marriage (Genesis 19:1-9)
Written for a people in a time and place
DEEP DIVE
21



Turn & Talk



How compelling and clear is the narrative your church offers your teens?

To what extent have those five verses been convincing enough to youth for those verses to compete with culture’s narrative?
24



The Big Question



We should NOT be asking, “What is permissible?”

We should be asking, “What is most good and will bring the most blessing in my life?”

We have to offer one narrative for God-honoring sexual stewardship that sufficiently speaks everyone’s story, including those who experience same-sex attraction.

[Notes]
Many push back against those 5 verses, saying that they don’t condemn same-sex, loving, monogamous marriages with certainty
really, that’s a person who wants something to be true and unless there’s an undeniable argument against it
We shouldn’t be asking “is this permissible?”

We should be asking what is most good?
What will bring the most blessing to my life?
And then don’t settle for anything less

So we can’t just argue against a sinful behavior
We have to offer the most good things
We have to offer one narrative for God-honoring sexual stewardship that sufficiently speaks to the many stories among your youth, including those who experience same-sex attraction

To do so, we have to look more broadly at how God created us for relationship and what contexts He has given us to best enjoy relationship
But you will quickly see why the Church is having a problem: few churches preach these things and even fewer really believe them and invest time and energy accordingly



God’s Narrative



Created for perfect intimacy with God and the Body of Christ (Genesis 2, Leviticus 26:12)
Intimacy needs are good and normal (Matthew 26:36-46; Matthew 4:1-11)
Neither sex nor marriage are promised or necessary to meet intimacy needs

[Notes]
define intimacy needs

After the fall no perfect intimacy
if we don’t meet in healthy ways or will meet in unhealthy ways

so for the sexual minority, yes, you were created for intimacy, but no one is promised or needs sex or marriage to meet their intimacy needs

but we don’t know how to meet needs outside of marriage or sex
and straight people don’t do this, so why should sexual minorities?

What are we called to? How do we meet our intimacy needs?

Culturally, we assume that we will marry
The default path is marriage, and an unfortunate few are called off of that path to celibacy
We will all be abstinent and single for a time, but there are no limits to dating other than saving sex for marriage
The problem with these assumptions are that they contradict what the Bible has to say about singleness, celibacy, and marriage.

It is also inaccurate to assume the opposite: that all are first called to lifelong celibacy
A majority of people will ultimately be married, so conflating a season of abstinent singleness with lifelong celibacy fails to recognize the unique blessings and challenges of lifelong celibacy





God’s Narrative



Our first calling: a period of abstinent singleness
Enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ
Called to neither lifelong celibacy nor marriage
Submit our sexuality to God, study the Scriptures, discern with God and others

[Notes]
we should not assume that we are called to marriage just because we have sexual desires, want to be a parent, or find abstinent singleness to be too challenging

part of this discernment should also be an honest examination of what kind of dating, if any, is edifying and necessary, even for those who are called to marriage

None should assume we will get married and all should submit their sexuality to God, gay or straight
But again, straight people don’t do this, so why should gay people?






God’s Narrative



What does the Bible say about celibacy and marriage?
Clear preference for celibacy + given, not chosen
Allows for marriage, ministers to the Church, difficult

[Notes]
see stuff in handout 
  
Ultimately, the Bible comes up just short of calling all people to lifelong celibacy, but it also reprimands the person who assumes he or she will be married



God’s Narrative



For those called to lifelong celibacy
The Church must honor and support in practical and structural ways
Accept, embrace, and thrive
Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges

[Notes]
Those who find themselves in continued celibacy, despite their desire to be married (whether because they are not yet married, widowed, divorced, or are sexual or gender minorities that believe they should not marry), will benefit from accepting their present circumstances, embracing their current calling, and learning to thrive in it
These individuals may find it comforting (or discouraging) that Jesus recognized that some will be called to celibacy involuntarily but should accept and embrace their circumstances nonetheless

few churches teach these things
Church lift marriage on a pedestal and fail to provide support for single people to do singleness well




God’s Narrative



For those called to marriage
Lifetime vocation between a man and a woman to enjoy intimacy and raise children for the Body of Christ
Reflection of the intimacy and complementarity in Trinity

[Notes]
it’s not that we’re saying we don’t want gay people to be happy
its just that Christian marriage has been uniquely reserved for a specific purpose
And for many straight people marriage is not the way they will enjoy the most goodness or blessing in life

instead what we often hear in the church is that every has a right to be married and the purpose of marriage is to make you happy




God’s Narrative



All are called to steward sexuality in inconvenient ways

All can meet their intimacy needs in singleness
DEEP DIVE

[Notes]
the invitation to those who experience same-sex attraction is no less good and the challenges are no more great

Deep dive: brainstorm programming to support celibates

Again, our argument is that asking whether something is permissible is the wrong question
We should be asking what is most good?

And God’s narrative says that for every person, the most good will be found in a period of abstinent singleness, celibacy, or marriage with someone of the opposite sex done correctly



The Problem



Instead…

All are promised marriage 

We can’t meet our intimacy needs as single people 

Marriage is about being happy and we don’t need permission from God

[Notes]
Few straight Christians are truly submitting their sexualities to God
Few churches truly support celibacy in any meaningful ways
So why should an SSA person do any different?




Parting Questions



Which of these gaps between what we promise and what we offer have you seen in the Church?

Which of these concepts are hardest to put into practice?



The Solution



The Church needs to be a place where expectations are consistent and all people can meet their needs for companionship in healthy ways.
We need to rediscover spiritual friendship in the Church, setting the Body of Christ as our first family.



The Challenge



Call straight Christians to submit their sexualities to God

Call the Church to support celibacy in meaningful and structural ways
DEEP DIVE

[Notes]
If you’re concerned about convicting Side A LGBT+ Christians of their disobedience
John 8:7 “…Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.”

If you want the Church to offer LGBT+ people something truly better
