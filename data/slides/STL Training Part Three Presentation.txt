PART THREE:Sensitivity &How to Minister
Session Goal
To grow in your empathy for and sensitivity toward sexual minorities and learn how to minister to sexual minorities

Sensitivity

[Notes]
not just one session—something we have been doing the whole time
want to review first two sessions and the ways each element of those provided opportunities to grow empathy and sensitivity
Part One Recap
Theology
Why we believe what we believe
What we should offer as an alternative to the gay lifestyle

Why we believe it
Neither marriage nor sex promised or necessary to meet needs
Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges

[Notes]
If we were part of a church that really believed this and supported this, we wouldn’t just be asking SSA to refrain and it would actually be possible to meet out intimacy needs in community with God and the Body of Christ
What we should offer
Accurate theology about marriage
Nondiscriminatory application of Scripture
Shame-free church to talk about experience
Robust culture of singleness
Spiritual friendship to meet intimacy needs
Complex understanding of gender
Part One Recap
Being a Friend
Get to know the person
Encourage gender identification
Treat them as same


[Notes]
ask them about their story
as we will see today, gender key, so for those wanting to grow in masculinity/femininity, you can support that
don’t treat like someone of the opposite sex or as different from self (we will see more of that today)
Part Two Recap
Hearing a Story & Development
Predisposed but not determined
No one chooses SSA
Wholeness is a process
Gender is impactful
Part Two Recap
Hearing a Story & Development
Pornography is destructive
Everyone has experienced one of these
Sexual attraction is not an oppositional binary
Sensitivity Activity
What if this was my story?

17

[Notes]
As a group we are going to read snippets of a sexual minority’s story from his or her perspective. Each of us are going to read part of this. I want you to imagine this as if it were your story. Put yourself in this individual’s shoes. Really own this experience.
Sensitivity Activity
Which would you choose?

How should you minister differently?

21

[Notes]
Would you want to be a part of this kind of church?
 
Or would you rather be among those who accept you just the way you are?

What NOT to Say
False Promises
God has marriage for everyone
If you don’t get this right, you will go to Hell
God can do all things, so He will completely heal this in your lifetime


What NOT to Say
Behavioral Fixes
Just pray, read your Bible, and go to church more—God will take it away
You can choose anything—you weren’t forced to feel these things, so just stop
You’re still struggling because you’re not doing it right

What NOT to Say
Conversation Killers
You don’t need to think about this psychological/heady stuff
The Bible is clear that it’s wrong—why are you doubting even for a moment?
The Church has loved people well around this, you are just being needy

What NOT to Say

What are some other phrases you would add to the list?

Case Studies

[Notes]
case study describing person with OSA
but could just as easily be about SSA

ask you to read and discuss as a group what you think the core issues are and how you would minister
then consider if that would be different if SSA
Scenario 1
Dan is a Christian, but he hasn’t gone a month without having sex with a girl in years. He goes to clubs most weekends looking for a girl to take home. He has had sex with most of the women his age at work. He needs it, but it never seems to be satisfying. He comes to you looking for advice. He knows it is wrong, but he doesn’t know how to stop.

1.Core Issues?		2. How to Minister?		3.Would It Change?
sexual addiction
lack of healthy intimacy
64

[Notes]
Effective: 	help him identify what he really need and get that in healthy ways: healthy, intimacy Christian community
		practical steps to reduce unwanted behavior (accountability)

Poor:		shame-based behavior modification
		prayer and bible study to become “stronger”

Scenario 2
Jake is addicted to pornography and masturbation. Every night before he goes to bed, he types in his favorite porn site, watches a few videos until he finds girls that turn him on, and then masturbates. It’s gotten to the point that he is less aroused by the girls, but when he has tried not to masturbate before going to bed, he can’t seem to go to sleep. He knows it is wrong, but he doesn’t know how to stop.

1.Core Issues?		2. How to Minister?		3.Would It Change?

		prayer and bible study to become “stronger”
Scenario 3
After getting to know Robert, he shares with you that he has never felt like a man. He’s attracted to women and all, but he just doesn’t feel very manly. He is pretty passive, he isn’t good at sports, he can’t grow facial hair, and he has a higher-pitched voice. He talks about how his dad was a man’s man but they were never close and that in middle school and high school, he never felt like one of the guys. He asks you, “What does it mean to be a man, and how can I become more of one?”

1.Core Issues?		2. How to Minister?		3.Would It Change?
deflated masculinity
72

[Notes]
Effective:	investigate what he thinks it means to be a man and Biblical masculinity
		identify masculine strengths already possess
		encourage steps to grow

Poor:		push hyper-masculine American schema unto him
		“maybe you’re just less manly, but that’s okay”
Scenario 4
Jane shares that she is really lonely. She has felt kind of depressed, but she isn’t suicidal. She says that she has lots of friends and they do fun stuff together all of the time, but she still seems to feel alone. After she describes her friends and what they do together, you get the feeling that they are really superficial relationships and what Jane is lacking is true intimacy in her friendships. 

1.Core Issues?		2. How to Minister?		3.Would It Change?
depression
lack of healthy intimacy
76

[Notes]
Effective:	talk about what spiritual friendship is and how to do it
		intimacy needs inventory and how to satisfy in healthy ways	

Poor:		you can find all the intimacy you need in Christ—just spend more time in prayer and bible study
		you probably need a husband
Scenario 5
Martha has always been very insecure. She never feels beautiful enough, popular enough, or smart enough. She is ashamed of her small breasts and the fat under her arms. She has little sense of self worth, and while she says she is a Christian and finds her identity in Christ, she doesn’t really seem to know her value as a person in Christ.

1.Core Issues?		2. How to Minister?		3.Would It Change?
low self-worth
body shame
80

[Notes]
Effective:	investigate negative messages of self-worth: why does she need to be popular or smart or beautiful?
		does she think that she isn’t worthy of love?
		demonstrate by your love that that isn’t true and help her find healthy intimacy to reinforce
		talk about body shame and help reject messages from society

Poor:		just find your identity in Christ and you will find value and meaning
		work out and go back to school
