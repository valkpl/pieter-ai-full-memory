the CURSE
& the GLORY
of the EUNUCH


[Notes]
How were celibate, childless people marginalized in the Old Testament? What promises were made to childless celibates? How did Jesus fulfill those promises? How might that shape the ways we think about our sexualities today?

First, let's set the scene of the cultural and theological context Old Testament eunuchs found themselves in. 





Made for Intimacy



So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground….” The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” (Genesis 1:27-28 and 2:18)

Made for Intimacy



Sexual difference for marriage and procreation
Procreation mandate (more later)
Made for intimacy with other humans

[Notes]
Here we see that God created man and woman, and a central reason for their differentness was that they would marry and procreate. This was the natural, created order. They were commanded to marry and procreate. Another reason God created Eve was that God saw that when all Adam had was God, he was alone. This shows us that God created us for more than just relationship with God—God made us for relationship with other humans and to co-work with other humans on the projects God has given us. 



Made for Intimacy



Marriage+procreation was a moral obligation

Why?

God promised to fulfill His covenants with His people through marriage+procreation (hence the procreation mandate)

[Notes]
The Jews were very serious about this commandment to marry and procreate. Rabbinic Judaism considered marriage a moral obligation. He who forgoes marriage and procreation makes himself guilty of transgressing the commandment of God in Genesis 1:28. We see this in the fact that all rabbis married, except for one, Ben Azzai, who had to justify his celibacy. The Talmudic tractate Yebamoth says: “A man who does not concern himself with procreation should be considered to be shedding human blood.”  Examples of the shame of celibacy can be found in Jeremiah 16: 2,9 and Isaiah 4:1. Lot (Genesis 19:30-38) and Leah and Rachel (Genesis 30:1-13) go to extreme lengths to avoid the shame of childlessness. 

Why was this commandment so important? Marriage and procreation were the primary ways through which God fulfilled his covenants to his people. In Genesis 12-17 describe God’s covenant with Abraham and his descendants. God promises Abraham that he will have many descendants, they will will have the whole land of Canaan, they will be a great nation, and they will bless the earth. The people of Israel had to marry and procreate to fulfills these promises, so failing to follow God’s command endangered the blessing of the people of Israel.

Imagine yourself as an Old Testament Israelite. How would you respond to this procreation mandate? How might couples struggling with infertility, widows, divorcees, single parents, single people who want to marry, and people who are intentionally celibate for the sake of serving others feel?

The Eunuch



If a man’s testicles are crushed or his penis is cut off, he may not be admitted to the assembly of the LORD. (Deuteronomy 23:1)

Voluntarily for honored service, POWs forced to serve, sex slaves, punish/humiliate

Excluded from worshipping God

[Notes]
Now the eunuch enters our story.

Deuteronomy 23:1
If a man’s testicles are crushed or his penis is cut off, he may not be admitted to the assembly of the LORD.

Most commonly, eunuchs were men who were castrated, and therefore, sterile and often unable to participate in sexual intercourse. There were many reasons this was done to people: Sometimes people became eunuchs ceremonially so that they could serve in pagan religious practices. Other times people captured in war were forced to become eunuchs so they could serve in the royal court of a foreign nation. People were made eunuchs to be used as sex slaves. And sometimes people were made eunuchs just to punish, humiliate, inflict pain, control, or subjugate.

As a result, eunuchs were excluded from the people of Israel under Mosaic Law. In Deuteronomy 23:1, it was commanded that eunuchs were to be kept from worship services because they were unclean and unworthy to worship God with the people of Israel: if worship is a living sacrifice of our bodies to God, then the worship of a eunuch was unworthy because the sacrifice was physically defective.




A Promise



“Don’t let foreigners who commit themselves to the Lord say, ‘The Lord will never let me be part of his people.’ And don’t let the eunuchs say, ‘I’m a dried-up tree with no children and no future.’ For this is what the Lord says: I will bless those eunuchs who keep my Sabbath days holy and who choose to do what pleases me and commit their lives to me. I will give them—within the walls of my house—a memorial and a name far greater than sons and daughters could give. For the name I give them is an everlasting one. It will never disappear! (Isaiah 56:3-5)

[Notes]
But despite the curse of the eunuch, Isaiah 56 offers hope to the eunuch.

Isaiah 56:3-5 (New Living Translation)
3 “Don’t let foreigners who commit themselves to the Lord say,
    ‘The Lord will never let me be part of his people.’
And don’t let the eunuchs say,
    ‘I’m a dried-up tree with no children and no future.’
4 For this is what the Lord says:
I will bless those eunuchs
    who keep my Sabbath days holy
and who choose to do what pleases me
    and commit their lives to me.
5 I will give them—within the walls of my house—
    a memorial and a name
    far greater than sons and daughters could give.
For the name I give them is an everlasting one.
    It will never disappear!




A Promise



God promises the eunuch (and more generally childless celibate Christians)
just as much human family,
even more spiritual children, and
opportunity to serve God in ways that will be honored and remembered

[Notes]
In contrast to the exclusion of eunuchs found in Deuteronomy 23:1, Isaiah 56 promises the eunuch family, belonging, and honor: Instead of being excluded from Jewish worship, they will be included “within the walls of my house.” Instead of being forgotten and lost to history because they had no children, they will be remembered in a way greater than “sons and daughters could give.” Instead of being humiliated, they will be honored. Instead of rejected, welcomed. Instead of being exploited, cherished. Instead of being viewed and treated primarily by the nature of their brokenness, they will be named as a child of God because God will call out the image of God found at the core of their person. 

But these promises aren't just for literal eunuchs. Isaiah is a book of poetic prophecy, so the use of the word eunuch here has historically been understood as a promise particularly to celibate people without children.

God seems to be promising celibate people a home where they can find belonging and family, greater spiritual children than biological parents, and a legacy that won't be forgotten.
Is that realistic? Fanciful? Can we find belonging and family without romance and sex? Can having many spiritual children be more satisfying than a few biological children, or is that double-speak?

Jesus establishes a new covenant where there is something greater than biological family and the physical wealth we can acquire in this life

Jesus offers celibate Christians deeper family and greater purpose than a fallen world could ever offer

[Notes]
Does God make good on His promise? Isaiah 56, like many prophecies in the Old Testament, points to what will be fulfilled by the Messiah—it points to a work Jesus will do for God’s glory.

Here’s how Jesus fulfills that hope: Christ’s life and resurrection established a new covenant where there is something greater than biological family and the physical wealth we can acquire in this life. Jesus reminds us that what will matter in the next life is the family of God and our collaboration with God in the work of redeeming creation. In particular, God fulfills his promises to the eunuch by offering celibate Christians deeper family and greater purpose than a fallen world could ever offer. And we’ll see how celibate Christians should give all of us hope because they serve as a living example of how we will all live in the New Heaven and New Earth.  



Fulfillment



In Matthew 19 Jesus calls married believers back to lifelong faithful monogamy, making it more difficult to divorce.

The disciples find this standard laughably high and could be read to respond: “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better for us to cut off our genitals.”

[Notes]
To show this, we’ll need to go to Matthew 19, where Jesus gives celibacy new theological meaning in often overlooked but monumental ways.

In Matthew 19: 3-12, Jesus calls married people to a deeper level of commitment to each other. He says that Moses allowed the Jewish people to divorce because their hearts were hard. Instead, he taught that except for sexual immorality, there is no grounds for divorce. That’s a high standard. In response, the disciples jokingly suggest that it would be better not to marry.

As we've explained, the Jewish people were commanded to marry and procreate. Because the multiplication of God’s people was the primary way through which God fulfilled his covenants to his people, celibacy was not good or normal for the average Jew. So, it was laughable to suggest it would be good or normal for a Jew not to marry. To get the full effect of the disciples’ suggestion with modern ears, perhaps we could rewrite the verse to say, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better for us to cut off our genitals.”



Fulfillment



Jesus responded by telling a crowd of Jewish people who were commanded to marry and procreate to consider celibacy

Then Jesus goes further by comparing this kind of singleness to the life of a eunuch (to suggest a lifetime/permanent calling)



[Notes]
Now notice what Jesus says in response to the disciples: “Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given.” Jesus says, “Yeah, actually, some of you have been called to celibacy, and it would be better for you not to marry.” This is radical. He told a crowd Jewish people who were commanded to marry and procreate to consider celibacy.

Then Jesus goes further by comparing this kind of singleness to the life of a eunuch. While this comparison seems strange to modern readers, it was downright scandalous for Jesus’ first audience, as we've already explained. 

Why then would Jesus use such a scandalous word to describe this new kind of singleness for the sake of the kingdom? The comparison wasn’t an accident. It was meaningful: being a eunuch is permanent and irrevocable—you can’t undo genital mutilation. Theologians have consistently concluded that Jesus made this comparison to communicate that this kind of singleness is meant to be permanent and irrevocable.

Max Thurian explains, “We cannot otherwise understand why the Lord should see fit to scandalize the Jews and shock them by a word which revolted them and which had the literal meaning of a condition incompatible with membership of the people of Israel or of the liturgical assembly.” Karl Barth agrees as well, stating that accepting the call to celibacy not only involves the temporary abstention from romance and sex but a permanent forbiddance from. St. Athenagoras even celebrates lifelong celibacy, using a Greek word for “voluntary celibacy” that communicates an absolute and permanent state: “There are to be found among us many men and women who have grown old without marrying, in the hope of belonging more completely to God. If perseverance in virginity and voluntary celibacy brings us near to God, and if the mere thought, the mere desire of pleasure take us away from him, how much more should we avoid the acts from whose very thought we flee.”




Fulfillment



Isaiah 56 promises eunuchs (looked down upon for lack of spouse/children) honor, family, and legacy

Matthew 19 offers celibates (looked down upon for lack of spouse/children) family and kingdom purpose

[Notes]
But, it’s hard not to read this passage as Jesus speaking to the eunuch and saying, “In this way, I have fulfilled my promises in Isaiah 56.” Isaiah 56:3-5 promises eunuchs, a people who will have no spouse or biological offspring and whose lot was seen as a curse by the Jewish people, that if they fully commit themselves to the work of God, God will give them greater honor, family, and legacy than any offspring could provide. And in Matthew 19:3-12, Jesus is promising celibate Christians, a people who will have no spouse or biological offspring and whose lot was seen as a curse by the Jewish people, that if they fully commit themselves to the work of God, God will give them deeper family and greater kingdom purpose. 

Isaiah promised that those without biological family could find family and purpose in God’s family. In Matthew 19, Jesus lifts up celibacy from being a curse of loneliness to being a normative calling for the average Christian that has a theological and practical beauty equal to marriage. And to demonstrate that point, he makes a direct connection between the celibate and the eunuch. In the lifting up of celibacy, the hope of the eunuch is fulfilled, and they finally reach that promised place of honor and glory.



Fulfillment



Jesus didn’t just preach it, he lived it

Christ’s death and resurrection establishes a new covenant where marriage was no longer necessary to fulfill God’s promises because we join God’s family by Christ’s work on the cross, not birth into a Jewish family

[Notes]
But Jesus didn't just teach about living like a eunuch for the sake of the kingdom. He lived it. He himself was celibate. He did not marry or have sex or have children. He was not romantic with anyone. But he was not rejecting God’s commandment to marry and procreate. Instead, he is foreshadowing the fulfillment of that covenant and the dawn of a new order where both celibacy and marriage are good and normal for the average Christian. Christ’s death and resurrection establishes a new covenant where marriage and procreation are no longer the only ways to join God’s family. In John 1:13 and John 3:5-7, Jesus foreshadows a new covenant where you do not belong to Israel according to the flesh, but become a child of God through new birth. Colossians 1:6 and 10 confirm that the fruit we are commanded to bear in light of Christ’s resurrection is not physical children but spiritual children. As described in Hebrews 8, Christ’s death establishes a new covenant where marriage was no longer necessary to fulfill God’s promises because we join God’s family by Christ’s work on the cross, not birth into a Jewish family. This is meaningful because marriage and procreation are no longer a commandment for all. And Christ’s resurrection started the work of bringing about the New Heaven and the New Earth where we will all be celibate, as Matthew 22:30 makes clear. This is meaningful because it makes clear our eternal destiny is the life of the celibate and celibacy in the body of Christ points us to the New Heaven and New Earth.

Jesus lifted up celibacy from being a curse for a few unfortunate Jews to an equally good and normal calling for the average Christian

[Notes]
Jesus lifted up celibacy from being a curse for a few unfortunate Jews to an equally good and normal calling for the average Christian. How? Jesus modeled celibacy with his life. Then in response to the disciples in Matthew 19, he institutes with his words this new option to stand on equal footing with marriage. Finally, Jesus gives his life and is resurrected, in part to establish a new covenant under which celibacy is equally valued.

Let’s review: Isaiah 56 alludes to a people on the margins who were without family and were treated as second class citizens—eunuchs lived in shame. But Isaiah 56 offers the eunuch hope that a Messiah will bring them inclusion, family, and purpose. Then in Matthew 19, Jesus fulfills those promises to the eunuch by tying to eunuch to the celibate, lifting up celibacy, and giving the celibate Christian deep family and kingdom purpose. With the eunuch, celibate Christians enjoy the glory of the Lord as a people chosen and lifted up. Celibate Christians today, and in particular gay celibate Christians today, see themselves in the experience of the ancient eunuch. Perhaps we are moderns eunuchs.

Jesus seems to challenge Christians to consider permanently giving up a spouse and children for the sake of serving our communities with undivided attention. Can Christians to demand and take romance and marriage and sex? Can we unthinkingly pursue those? Or must we pause and seriously consider Christ’s invitation?

[Notes]
If Jesus challenges Christians to consider permanently giving up a spouse and children for the sake of serving our communities with undivided attention,
does it make sense for Christian to just demand and take romance and marriage and sex?
can we just unthinkingly, on autopilot, pursue those?
Or must we pause and seriously consider this invitation?

How is the unthinking, autopilot pursuit of romance working for you?
Do we need to romance? To be happy? To be whole? To find belonging and community?
