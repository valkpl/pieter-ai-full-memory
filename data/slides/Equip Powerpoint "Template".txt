ABOUT PIETER
Historic Sexual Ethic
A belief that God’s best for every Christian is either vocational singleness (a lifetime vocation of abstinent singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention) or Christian marriage (a lifetime vocation of opposite-sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom)

[Notes]
Here’s what I mean when I say a historic sexual ethic
a belief that God’s best for every Christian is either what I call vocational singleness
(which is a lifetime vocation of abstinent singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention)
or Christian marriage
(which Christians have historically understood to be a lifetime vocation of opposite-sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom)

SESSION OBJECTIVES
Review policy and strategy proposals
Discuss, highlighting strengths and noting   challenges/alternatives
Offline workshopping
(Optional) 2nd discussion/workshopping session
Future partnership? to build out resources/programming called for by final policy/strategy

[Notes]
offering suggestions for policy and strategy based on preliminary conversation with Ben
these are merely proposals
our goal is to discuss each of these, highlight strengths, notes challenges and potential alternatives
then to do some further workshopping offline
and then potential gather again to consider final proposals
after arriving at that consensus, we might engage in further partnership to build out some of the resources and programming called for by your final policy and strategy

CORE VALUES
compassion
clarity
conviction consistency

[Notes]
4 values: compassion, clarity, conviction, consistency

first let's start with policy
POLICY: STAFF

8
POLICY: STAFF
Policy for all staff:
All staff will be required to personally steward their sexualities according to a historic Christian sexual ethic

[Notes]
want to be clear: this is regardless of sexual orientation
whether you are gay or straight, you will be held to these expectations
further, all staff will be required to personally steward their sexualities according to a compassionate traditional sexual ethic


9
POLICY: STAFF
Policy for new staff:
Regardless of sexual orientation, new staff will be expected to hold a Side B perspective and be willing to teach that ethic when appropriate based on their role.

[Notes]
STAFF
new staff:
regardless of sexual orientation, new staff will be expected to hold a historic Christian sexual ethic and be willing to teach that ethic as appropriate based on their role

as a result, gay applicants in ongoing same-sex romantic or sexual relationships will not be hired
and straight applicants who hold a progressive sexual ethic will not be hired


10
POLICY: STAFF
Policy for existing staff:
Regardless of sexual orientation, existing staff will be asked not to contradict Trinity’s convictions privately or publicly and be willing to teach that ethic when appropriate based on their role. But…

[Notes]
existing staff:
regardless of sexual orientation, all existing staff will be asked not to contradict church teaching privately or publicly
regardless of sexual orientation, existing staff in position where it's reasonable to expect them to teach about sexual stewardship will be asked to teach a compassionate traditional sexual ethic

11
POLICY: STAFF
Policy for existing staff:
If an existing staff member cannot honor these requests, resolution will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, with a hope that a year of open-minded discernment about sexual ethics will lead to alignment (but may conclude with helping the staff member transition)

[Notes]
addressing any existing staff who cannot abide by these requests on a case-by-case basis, with a hope that a year of open-minded conversation about sexual ethics will lead to alignment but recognizing that for some it may conclude with help the staff transition

we want to be clear
we do not think that current staff or future applicants who hold a progressive sexual ethic or are in same-sex romantic or sexual relationships are lesser Christians
we are confident that they have genuine and robust relationships with Jesus
we are confident we will spend an eternity together in heaven
and at the same time, we are convinced of the historic Christian sexual ethic and bear a responsibility to teach and disciple parents, kids, and everyone at Trinity Church according to God wisdom
we also care deeply about current staff who hold a progressive sexual ethic, we respect your process, and more than anything we want you to be in a space where you can fully express and put into action your convictions
DISCUSSION
POLICY: NON-STAFF  LEADERS/TEACHERS

14
POLICY: NON-STAFF
Policy for non-staff leaders/teachers:
Asked not to contradict Trinity’s convictions privately or publicly and be willing to teach that ethic when appropriate based on their role. Can privately hold a progressive sexual ethic. Can refer to staff.

[Notes]
anyone in theologically influential leadership
small group leaders, those serving communion, worship leaders, teachers, elders, teaching children
basically anything on camera or involved in the sacred
if over a year, a role might involve them sharing their perspective in a group setting in a way that can be perceived as representing the church

ask them to teach a traditional sexual ethic when appropriate for their role
asked not to contradict church teaching privately or publicly
teaching/upfront non-staff can privately hold a Side A perspective, as long as publicly they're willing to teach a Side B perspective when appropriate
if asked about their personal opinion or Trinity's position in a role where being asked these questions is uncommon, can refer to staff

15
POLICY: NON-STAFF
Required yearly stewardship summit:
Cast vision for leading at Trinity, including seeking Christlikeness and accountability as stewards: finances, the environment, eating/exercise, sleep, mental health, meeting intimacy needs in healthy ways, character development, kingdom work, etc.

[Notes]
all current non-staff at this level and new non-staff at this level will be required to join for a yearly stewardship summit
either 3-4 sessions in-person, a Sat lunch, or an online privately linked on-demand video series
where staff will cast vision for helping shepherd some of God's people
including seeking Christ-likeness and inviting accountability from fellow believers
called to a higher standard
both for our own good, and because our faithfulness has a greater impact on others
God has invited each of us to be stewards of ourselves and the world around us
it's around those different areas of stewardship that we encourage you to pursue christlikeness
and encourage you to spur each other on toward love and good needs
as we do the same
finances, the environment, eating and exercise, sleep, mental health, meeting our intimacy needs in healthy ways, character development, and how we leverage our 9-to-5 jobs for the sake of the kingdom
then ask them to sign/affirm statement of faith and commitment to lifestyle that honors Jesus
DISCUSSION

17
POLICY: NON-STAFF
Challenge: consistent accountability
To avoid accidental discrimination, cultivate discipleship relationships with non-staff leaders that would allow you to provide accountability.

[Notes]
CHALLENGE with accountability: potential accidental discrimination if same-sex couple is publicly obvious but straight sin private
move toward wholistic accountability that involves having discipleship relationships with straight lay leaders where you can offer accountability (for the sake of their thriving and to protect sheep they're leading from getting hurt by their sin)
how specific do we go with accountability (consistency within sex ethics first, then consistency across areas of stewardship next)
consistent sexual ethics: dating, porn/mast, discernment, divorce/remarriage, adultery, sex outside of marriage
how do we roll this out: build relationships where this will be seen, have courage to respond to what you see WITH COMPASSION
DISCUSSION

19
POLICY: NON-STAFF
Challenge: when a kid comes out
Develop a guide for how leaders/volunteers respond when kids/teens share about an LGBT+ experience

[Notes]
related to this (consistency among staff and non-staff teachers/leaders): how to respond when a kid comes out
there needs to be a word-for-word guide for this that is shared with all leaders and volunteers
often redirecting to parent and/or other leaders best equipped to provide support
if someone can't commit to this response, help them find another way to serve
guide would include how to respond if kids share or ask questions in public
and how to respond to FAQs form kids/teens
DISCUSSION
POLICY: VOLUNTEERS
Policy for volunteers:
Not required to hold or teach a historic Christian sexual ethic (or accept accountability). Gate-keep stewardship summit.

22
POLICY: VOLUNTEERS

[Notes]
VOLUNTEER (in a non-teaching/leading/upfront/sacred way)
don't have to agree to accountability or commit to trad sex ethic
those helping place/connect potential volunteers should have a way to make a quick assessment of their interest, skills
then if higher level fits, tell them about stewardship summit and whether they're interested in that (perhaps list 3-5 reasons why some aren't ready for that, and normalize that that's totally okay. not a lesser Christian for not, just not the best place for them to lead at this time)
DISCUSSION
STRATEGY

[Notes]
second, what might be a wise strategy for public and private discipleship without white paper while avoiding bait-and-switch

25
STRATEGY
Avoid LGBT+ signaling:
If not ready for public clarity, avoid talking about LGBT+ topics in any way to prevent bait-and-switch

[Notes]
if not ready to clarify publicly yet, avoid using pronouns or taking other steps that would falsely signal Side A (unfortunately this means you're probably doing to need to completely avoid any mention of LGBT+ people or SSAs/gender incongruence in public, even if there are relevant current events) (it's out of respect for Side A people that we aren't send vague vibes)
DISCUSSION

27
STRATEGY
Discipling Side A gay people:
Confess the sins of the Church
Clarify Trinity's convictions
Share about practical steps to raise the bar for straight sexual stewardship + seek training for better pastoral care + support singles
(Can’t marry. Baptism case-by-case.)

[Notes]
PRIVATE in private with Side A people: (1) be quick to confess the sins of Christians historically, (2) be quick to clarify Trinity's convictions, (3) tell them about the practical steps you're already taking to raise the bar for straight sexual stewardship + seek training to offer better pastoral care + support those who are single for whatever reason
be prepared for Side A people to be mad
can't marry them
consider baptism requests on a case by case basis (gay parents baptizing kid, teens, adult gays)
DISCUSSION

29
STRATEGY
Discipling Side B gay people:
Provide effective pastoral care
Value their gifts and leadership
Confess the sins of the Church
Clarify private commitment to Side B
Share about practical steps to raise the bar for straight sexual stewardship, teach about vocational singleness, cultivate intentional Christian community, and (eventually) public Side B

[Notes]
PRIVATE how to help Side B christian thrive in our church? provide effective one-on-one pastoral care, value their gifts and leadership (depending on maturity), confess the sins of Christians historically, clarify your private commitment to Side B, tell them about practical steps you're taking to raise the bar for straight sexual stewardship, commitment to teach publicly about vocational singleness + family for vocational singleness, cultivate intentional Christian community?, share about eagerness to be more public so can equip everyday Christians to think+love better around this and to equip parents to lead kids in age-appropriate convos and prevent the wounds of the closet (name sadness that youre not there yet)

30
STRATEGY
Addressing Side Y concerns (gay or straight):
Privately address concerns about gay identity language, sexual orientation change, and culpability of same-sex attractions

[Notes]
PRIVATE how to address Side Y concerns privately about gay identity language and sexual orientation change and SSAs a sin (code switch)
DISCUSSION

32
STRATEGY
Supporting single Christians (straight+gay):
Teach about vocational singleness and family for singles
Connect vocational singles to start intentional Christian community
Highlight kingdom work stories of vocational singles

[Notes]
PUBLIC how to support single folk - teach about vocational singleness and family for vocational singleness, help connect vocational singles to start intentional Christian community, highlight the kingdom work stories of single leaders
DISCUSSION
LAYING A FOUNDATION

[Notes]
ALL to lay foundation for public rollout and have good fruit and consistency to point to

potential for Pieter to help develop lay leader training, guide for when kids come out, training for pastoral care providers about good one-on-one, content review for public teaching on vocational singleness, coach through intentional Christian community incubator (additional costs)
