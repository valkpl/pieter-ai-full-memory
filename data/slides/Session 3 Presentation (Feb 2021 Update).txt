POSTURE


[Notes]
I’m Amber Carroll and I am EQUIP’s Parent Content Specialist.  I developed and recently released EQUIP’s Parent Course, a 5-week intensive designed to equip parents of young kids with a deep familiarity with God’s good plans for sexual stewardship and provide practical, age-appropriate guides for conversation about sexual stewardship and culture.
In addition to my work with EQUIP, I devote many hours each week to my most demanding job: parenting.  My daughter, Blaise, is 7, and my son, Ransom, is 5.
The work of EQUIP is important to me for two reasons.
1. My children.  If one of my children happens to be gay, I don’t want shame and hiding and fear for them.  I want them to grow up hearing that God loves them deeply and has good things in store for them.  That Jesus is worth any sacrifices they must make to follow Him.  I want them to be loved, supported, drawn into deep and committed family relationships, and discipled well in their church. And I believe EQUIP helps churches become places where this is possible.
2. My ex-husband. I was married for almost 8 years to a gay man who believed that marrying a woman was what he had to do to be acceptable to the church and to God.  Due, in part, to the church’s lack of support for him and for us, he left me six years ago and has since turned away from anything having to do with God or church.  I want to be part of offering a solution to churches so that other gay people don’t feel the need to leave the church to find family and belonging.
God invites each of us to first BELONG to God’s family, second to BELIEVE who God is and what that means for us, and third to BECOME who God has called each of us to be.  We can love LGBTQ+ people better by inviting them to belong, encouraging their discovery of what they believe, and walking alongside them as they become.
How can you, as pastors and leaders in your church, posture yourselves to minister to LGBTQ+ people well?
It starts with a right posture of humility, empathy, compassion, and patience.
So what does this posture look like?
Historically, the LGBT+ people in our pews, especially teens, don’t see pastors and church leaders as safe people to talk to. And when over 50% of gay people who are raised in church leave the faith (Us Versus Us, Andrew Marin), we have a problem. Gay people are watching, looking for those they can safely share with: Who can I trust? Who makes the gay jokes? What is said in sermons and in Sunday School about gay people? What will my pastor think of me? Can I find family here?
How do we demonstrate safety?




Intentionally “do life” with gay people
Include them
This doesn’t mean gay people are a project

Posture

Become

[Notes]
-Intentionally “do life” with the gay people in your church family. Include them in your friend group, your celebrations, your holidays. Have them in your home often.
This doesn’t mean that you should make a gay person your project or seek to check the “gay friend” box off your Christian to-do list, but it does mean that we can find those on the margins in our churches and seek to provide family for them.





Listen well
Invite your gay friend to share their story
Listening forms and solidifies authentic relationship

Posture

Become

[Notes]
-Listen well. To listen with an attitude of humility and openness is an act of love. Strive to foster a relational dynamic of trust. Invite your gay friend to share his or her story and listen without assumptions or judgment or ultimatums. Stories are so important because stories remind us that we can’t make blanket assumptions about gay people; if you’ve heard one gay person’s story, you’ve heard one gay person’s story. Even when we have been front and center to the challenges of a gay family member or close friend, there is some level of understanding that can only be gained by personal experience.  Recognizing this communicates to the gay person that you value his or her unique story.
And listening, really listening, forms and solidifies authentic relationship. And without relationship, without genuine love and trust, any truths we share will fall on hard ground.




Give grace
Gay Christians carry a lot of weight related to their sexuality
Avoid forced-choice moments

Posture

Become

[Notes]
-Give lots of grace. Gay people, especially gay Christians, carry so much weight related to their sexuality. They felt different from an early age, were likely victims of bullying, fear family rejection, wonder if God hates them, anticipate judgement and rejection at church, may attempt to repress or hide their attractions or somehow become straight, endure high levels of loneliness and isolation and depression and stress, feel that they are held to a higher standard of behavior than straight people, may contemplate or attempt suicide.
You may be tempted to challenge the individual to choose between God and his or her gay identity, same-sex romantic relationship, stable view of self, etc.  But forcing this choice will likely lead the individual to reject God in favor of the goodness he or she has found in acceptance, community, and belonging among other LGBTQ+ people.  You can invite the person to steward his or her sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic for now.  Then, patiently explore what God believes about sexual stewardship, why He has ordered the world in this way, and what that might mean for the person you are walking with.  Give the person time to raise his or her concerns and work through those with the Holy Spirit. We can trust the power of the gospel and the Holy Spirit to reveal what is true to each of us in HIS time.
Obedience to God’s commands and design can be a very hard road. Gay people must give up the possibility of romance with and marriage to the person they’re most naturally attracted to, must navigate a church culture that caters to straight, married people, and must face Christians and churches who misunderstand or are willfully ignorant of the crosses that gay Christians bear.
Instead of rushing to correct our gay friends when it comes to sexual ethics or behavior, or insisting that what they say is toxic to them really isn’t, we can extend extra grace.




Check your language
Stay away from offensive or outdated language
Practice term-mirroring

Posture

Become

[Notes]
-Check your language. We can communicate sensitivity by being aware of our language. Strive to use words and phrases correctly, avoid the ones you know are generally considered offensive or outdated (“homosexual,” “gay agenda,” “sexual preference,” “love the sinner, hate the sin,” “gay lifestyle,” etc).
Practice term-mirroring as this demonstrates that you are listening and working to use language that is comfortable for them.




The Church doesn’t get a pass
Give space for LGB people to share where your church could improve
Be willing to apologize

Posture

Become

[Notes]
How can we minister to those who have been hurt by the Church or by Christians?
-The Church doesn’t get a pass on caring for gay people well.  
Many gay people have heard, “Be content in all circumstances. This is teaching you to trust Him.  God is enough.”  Saying that to grieving, hurting, confused, lonely, possibly suicidal people is the antithesis of Christ’s love.  And even if we aren’t saying those words, the lack of family and friendship, care and concern, and right theology and teaching is loud.
Humbly giving space for LGB people to talk about what they see in their own churches to their own church leadership, knowing that leadership will listen, shows care and concern. Give LGB people permission to let you know when and where your church could improve.  Humbly listen.  And then seek to make real changes.
We are called to be radical in our love for and family toward those on the margins, those who have experienced hurt at the hands of others, even Christians, even those who can’t tolerate being told that “God is enough” and those who are difficult to love.
Many Christians have made mistakes in the conversation surrounding faith and sexuality.  Many churches aren’t places where gay people can thrive with reasonable effort in their vocation. Unfortunately, few have apologized.
You don’t need to apologize for your beliefs or say, “I’m sorry for Christianity’s view of marriage.”  But you CAN say, “I’m sorry for how some Christians have mistreated LGBTQ+ people – it really breaks my heart. I’m sorry that our church isn’t a place where you can find committed, lived-in family right now. This isn’t the way it’s supposed to be.”
You don’t need to apologize for holding a traditional sexual ethic, but it’s possible that the manner and tone of your belief has hurt someone who’s gay.  A sincere apology can go a long way.

Everyone may not benefit from a “quiet time”
Trust the Holy Spirit


Posture

Become

[Notes]
-Get creative.
The heart of effective pastoral care is helping the person you are discipling deepen their personal relationship with Jesus.
Unfortunately, many LGB Christians have been hurt deeply by the actions of pastors and church mentors.  For some, even the Bible and prayer have become sources of shame.
This is a catch-22 for gay people.  They will find it difficult to thrive and enjoy wholeness without a personal relationship, but the primary ways we typically invite Christians into that have been poisoned, at least temporarily.
Gerrard Conley, a man who was subjected to ex-gay therapy as a teen, says this about the impact of the shame that was heaped on him by Christians:
“And God.  I will not call on God during this decade-long struggle.  Not because I want to keep God out of my life, but because His voice is no longer there.  What happened to me has made it impossible to speak with God, to believe in a version of Him that isn’t charged with self-loathing.  My ex-gay therapists took Him away from me, and no matter how many different churches I attend, I will feel the same dead weight in my chest.  I will feel the pang of deep love now absent from my life.  I will continue to experiment with different denominations, different religions.  I will continue to search.  Perhaps one day I will hear His voice again.  Perhaps not.  It’s a sadness I deal with on a daily basis.”
Some LGB people can’t endure the shame and turn instead to churches with a progressive sexual ethic, hoping God will understand.  Some leave the faith completely.  Others turn to suicide.
So how can we navigate this, both to ensure that we’re caring for people well and to encourage deep discipleship?
It is of upmost importance to strike the right balance between encouraging a personal relationship with Jesus, encouraging Bible reading and prayer, and not doing further damage or causing more shame.
For some gay people, this might mean patiently waiting for the Holy Spirit to heal old wounds caused by others who wielded Scripture and prayer as weapons.  For others, it may mean finding non-threatening ways to include Bible reading and prayer in their lives.
We cannot wash our hands of people who don’t experience the Holy Spirit like we do.  Find new ways to read the Bible, pray, talk about the Holy Spirit. Get creative!
-This could mean using corporate prayers that are read aloud together during community group.  An LGBT person may feel disconnected from private prayer, perhaps having been assured countless times that God would heal them through prayer.  When He didn’t, prayer became a reminder of their failure to pray hard enough or God’s failure to act.  Corporate prayer may be a way for LGBT+ people to engage in prayer safely.
-This could mean avoiding “God is my friend”-type worship music.  For someone who has been convinced that God is disappointed or disgusted with them because of something they can’t control (their sexual attraction), God isn’t a friend.  He’s more like an angry giant.  Instead, churches can choose music that leans on theology or corporate lament or praise instead of emotion-driven appeals.
-This may mean that God doesn’t “speak to” everyone when they read Scripture and that not everyone will benefit from a “personal devotion” or “quiet time.”  And being ok with Scripture used as learning about God’s character and the way He wants us to live.  Not everyone will find a personal meaning in Scripture that fits their exact circumstance and walk away from Bible study feeling that they were “fed” or “filled.”  Offer these Christians other ways to engage in Scripture and deepen their understanding of the character of God that isn’t dependent on emotions.
Of course, we hope that Bible-reading and prayer eventually lose their shame-producing capabilities.  We want gay people to think of God as a loving brother and hear His voice.  But for many LGB people, that’s not the reality right now.  And it may never be.  So we can get creative with our discipling efforts.
This also means pursuing your own holiness and sanctification.  Persevere in your own faith.  Repent, confess, forgive, urge your brothers and sisters on, continue meeting together, stay on the path of discipleship.  Trust that the good work God is doing in you and other believers will ultimately be for the good of all who believe in Him.




Foster dependence on Christ and relationship with Him, but not apart from community
We’re made for relationship with others, even in our perfected state.
All people need committed family           in addition to their relationship with God

Posture

Become

[Notes]
-Foster dependence on Christ and relationship with Him, but not apart from community
In Genesis 2, Adam experiences loneliness and isolation, even though he is in perfect friendship with God.  His relational needs weren’t satisfied in himself alone, or in himself and God alone, or in himself and God and the animals.  He needed relationship with another human. To say that a private relationship with God is enough doesn’t do justice to the created order (Smith).  We were made to participate in relationships: families, tribes, nations, and, ultimately, in the Body of Christ.
Something about our longing for companionship will always be more about bonding with the Body of Christ than with a romantic partner.  “You are the body of Christ, and individual members of it.” (1 Cor 12:27) “The Gentiles are co-heirs, members of the same body, and partners of the promise.” (Eph 3:6)  “And let the peace of the Messiah, to which you were also called in one body, control your hearts.” (Eph 3:15) “We who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another.” (Rom 12:5)  Even in the new Heaven and the new Earth, we will be in relationship with God and with each other, not with God alone.  “God’s dwelling is with humanity and He will live with them.” (Rev 21:3) Even in our perfected state, we’ll still need more than just God.  Because He created us that way.
It is crucial for LGB people to see God as their anchor AND for the Church to love gay people well.  Seeing Christ as our anchor, as enough, isn’t actually enough.  We must give the full picture.
God IS our anchor, but what happens when a storm comes along and there’s only one person in the boat? It’s pretty easy for one person to be washed overboard, even if the boat is securely anchored. And that’s how the Church has left gay people. Told them they’ve got an anchor and that’s all they need.
Instead, we need to get in the boat WITH them. Can you imagine facing a storm way out at sea all alone with the only reassurance being the memory of people telling you that you have an anchor?
The picture of many people in the boat during a storm fighting the waves together and helping each other not fall overboard AS we acknowledge Christ as our anchor who is with us no matter what —is that not a more complete picture of the gospel?
Consider this from Abbie Smith:
“No anything will ever fulfill my everything, except for the relationship for which I was made.  To say a solo, private relationship with God is enough simply doesn’t do justice to the created order.  In the garden, Adam’s unhindered friendship with God didn’t capture the whole picture of humanity’s story.  It didn’t capture God’s intended story for humankind’s existence.  Man wasn’t meant to be alone, even alone in a perfect friendship with God.  We were meant for more.  We were made to participate in a more dynamic whole, including relationships and families, tribes and nations.  We were designed for community, created to come alive in a context called the Body.”
All people, but perhaps gay people especially, need committed family in addition to their relationship with God.

How does same-sex attraction develop?
None of us are how God made us to be
Neither born gay nor chose to be gay

Become

[Notes]
For many, this gets down to the classic question: “are people born gay or do they choose to be gay”
Well I want to make clear right from the start, I never chose to be gay, and you never chose to be straight
Now to the second question: are people born gay
Before we go further, let’s reflect on why this question is so important. Commonly, many argue that if we knew that people were born gay, then we should assume that God intended people to be gay. Then, if God intended people to be gay, He must support those people following their God-given desires for monogamous relationships with people of the same sex. So, are people born gay?
Twins and hormone studies inconclusive, suggestion predisposition
The consensus of scientists…
Not genetically determined
But even if it was, that doesn’t tell us anything about God’s intentions, whether it is good
That’s a theological question, not a scientific question
Science can’t answer the question of God’s intentions because none of us are how God made us to be
corrupted at genetic level and raised in broken world

Will my same-sex attraction change?
No proven combination of spiritual disciplines or counseling to bring about change
Praying for change with any level of expectation is dangerous and unnecessary

Become

[Notes]
Scripture does not promise permanent relief from any temptation in this lifetime

Limited high-quality research demonstrates that only 3-4% of people who participated in sexual orientation change efforts experienced any change in their same-sex attractions, and even these results were from self-reports that cannot be verified.

No proven combination of spiritual disciplines or counseling to bring about change

Do miracles happen? Yes.

But praying for change with any level of expectation is dangerous.
The likelihood of your attractions changing even a little are the same as you getting into Harvard, becoming a millionaire, or playing high school baseball and eventually going pro. Would it be wise to pray for those things expectantly?
What happens when your faith in God, your belief that God is good, or your belief that God loves you hinges on whether you get into Harvard, become a millionaire, or your same-sex attractions change?
There is insufficient research about the effectiveness and harmfulness of sexual orientation change efforts in churches and counseling centers.
From my estimation of limited research and consistent anecdotal information, the frequent harm of ex-gay programs outweighs the benefits few experience.

Moreover, the search for change is unnecessarily risky: LGBT+ Christians don’t need to change their attractions to belong and thrive in our churches according to a traditional sexual ethic. Based on this, I would caution an individual from seeking to change their attractions. 

It’s a brokenness, but we don’t choose who we are attracted to and there is no formula for changing it

Can I call myself gay?

Create space for Christians to use the work gay

Become

[Notes]
Practice term mirroring as hospitality
Particularly if non-Christian

Distinguish between attractions, orientation, identity, and behavior to lower the stakes

Create space for Christians to use the word gay
The reality is, both the word “gay” and the phrase “same-sex attraction” are unclear and carry baggage
There is no perfect term for ministry to LGBT+ non-Christians, gay teens in your church, and straight culture warriors in your church
I choose to use the word most effective with gay teens and then make clear what I mean
Why?

gay teens are 5 times more likely than their peers to attempt suicide
LGBT+ youth who are religious are 38% more likely to attempt suicide than their non-religious LGBT+ peers
Gay teens from highly rejecting families are 8.4 times more likely to attempt suicide than their LGBT+ peers
And, 54% of gay people who grew up in the church have left

Using words like “gay” and “LGBT” are most effective with gay teens
Regardless of how hard you try to shelter your children, these are the words they will hear their friends use and media use to describe people who experience same-sex attraction
So if you tried to communicate with teens about this subject using “same-sex attraction", you are likely to be confusing or irrelevant, at best, or hateful, at worst.
If you set up a false dichotomy that they can either identify as gay or be a Christian, you are adding to the Gospel, and Paul has strong words for “Christians” who add to the Gospel.
If you force them to use terms that no one in their generation uses, instead of using language that is definitionally neutral, you are much less likely to be effective.
If a teen who will one day realize they experience same-sex attraction grows up hearing most of the world name their experience as being “gay” but you only use that word in a derogatory way that is mutually exclusive to God’s love, you have set that student up to adopt a progressive sexual ethic, reject God all together, and/or contemplate suicide.

I think it’s also important to distinguish between using the word ”gay” phenomenologically vs. ontologically
I am using the word phenomenologically, not ontologically. When we define something phenomenologically, we are naming something based on one’s experience or what it appears to be. In contrast, when we ask who a person is ontologically, we are asking who they are innately, by design. When I use the word gay, I am not saying that I or someone else is ontologically gay. I am not saying that I am a fundamentally different person or that God designed me to be gay. I am merely noticing that I am attracted to other people of the same-sex and using (in my opinion) the best word to describe that experience.

Ultimately, its an opportunity to share the gospel
"I am a Christian. I am gay. And I am convinced that God calls all Christians to celibacy or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex, including me.”
I am a child of God, first and foremost
Jesus and Jesus alone sits on the throne of my life
And I experience same-sex attraction
That has significantly impacted my journey and how I see the world
It has connected me with others who have similar experiences
I feel connected with people in the past who have had similar experiences
And I think I have something to offer the Church particularly because of my experiences
For those reasons I identify as gay to identify with others with similar experiences
I use the word gay to identify with people, not to identify with sin

Important distinction here about sexual addiction
Many gay Christians I know suffer from sexual addiction
Not because SSA is the result of sexual addiction itself
But because pornography, masturbation, and acting out with others was the solution we found to medicate the shame and loneliness we felt from being a Christian and experiencing same-sex attraction
This developed into an addiction that we will have to manage for the rest of our lives
But not all gay Christians struggle with sexual addiction
And there are plenty of straight Christians who struggle with sexual addiction

That’s all to say, if someone struggle with sexual addiction (gay or straight), accountability and managing temptation is going to look different and I encourage you to connect them with recovery programs specifically for sex addicts






 How do I meet my intimacy needs?
Ask, “What do you really need?”
Normalize
Jesus: angels in the wilderness and disciples in Gethsemane
Recognize meeting intimacy needs in healthy ways as an important spiritual discipline
Ministering: Core Q’s

Become

[Notes]
First ask what do you really need?
Do you really need something sexual or romantic?
Or do you need someone to talk, someone you know will be home when you get home, someone to celebrate with, someone to hold you when you cry
Often when we describe what we really need, its rarely something exclusively romantic or sexual

Next, normalize having intimacy needs, needing other people
If Jesus, the author and perfector of our faith needed the angels to attend to him in the wilderness and begged his disciples to stay up with him and pray with him before he was taken away—if our savior was a human with intimacy needs, its okay for us to have needs, its normal

Then recognize that if we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, our broken flesh will reach out for unsatisfying and destructive alternatives
Therefore, proactively meeting our intimacy needs in healthy ways is an important part of taking care of our temple
As Christians who reject spirit-body dualism, we need to embrace that taking care of our body is just as important as taking care of our soul
So our intimacy needs aren’t something to be ignored, they are something to be fulfilled






 How do I meet my intimacy needs?
Same-sex attractions are unmet needs for healthy intimacy that have been sexualized
Seek healthy relationships with safe friends

[Notes]
Next, we can point out that same-sex attractions are unmet needs for healthy same-sex intimacy that have been sexualized
This doesn’t mean that if I meet all of my intimacy needs today, I won’t be gay tomorrow
But I have seen that when I’m getting what I really need—healthy friendship with other men—my desires for something romantic or sexual are easier to dismiss

So encourage those you disciple to seek out healthy relationships with safe friends
My life got better when I stopped ignoring my loneliness and started meeting my needs in healthy ways with deep friendship
And to this day, if I am struggling with lust, instead of shaming myself, I want my first response to be asking myself whether I have been meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways (which I haven’t)

I think some of this question isn’t just “what can I do with my loneliness today?”
But also, “how do I keep from being lonely in my 40s, 50s, and so on?”
To answer that, lets move to the last big question

For gay people like me who have been stewarding our sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic for awhile, particularly in celibacy, this is our biggest question
We can white-knuckle our way through celibacy for a couple of years
But after awhile its exhausting to walk out a vocation with often little support from our church, family, or friends
Plus as we age, our friends get married, have kids, and don’t have time or space for us in their lives
We’re tired of hearing pastors tell us, “Jesus can be everything you need,” when those pastors don’t live that life
Those pastors have a spouse and kids to go home to every night

For most of you, an honest answer is, “I wish this weren’t the case, but our church has been doing a poor job of supporting single and gay people for decades. I wish I could promise you that that will get better soon, but I can’t. The cross you’ll bear will probably be more painful than many of your peers. I am sorry. The world is not supposed to be this way. Our church is not supposed to be this way. So I personally give you permission to hold my feet to the fire on this. Don’t stop reminding me that things must be different, and quickly.”

Don’t be afraid to apologize for the sins of the Church, confess on behalf of the church
You don’t need to apologize for your beliefs, but you can apologize that the Church hasn’t done enough to be a place where gay people could thrive with reasonable effort according to a traditional sexual ethic

And finally after you apologize, affirm their need for committed, intimate family
Ultimately, they want hope that they will find family
God has created each of us for family
Yet most gay people have had a hard time finding it
So help them find that

Why would an LGBT+ person ever want to go to a church that affirms a traditional sexual ethic?
We can apply this question more generally: why would anyone want to be a part of a church that calls him or her to inconvenient stewardship of any kind?
Your church must offer something so compelling and beautiful that individuals will want to continue to be apart of your church despite other aspects they strongly disagree with.
We must invite them to be a part of a community of believers that is more satisfying than can be found anywhere else and invite them to come on mission with us to redeem the world.

[Notes]
What is the best way to love gay Christians who believe God blesses same-sex marriages?
As we noted in our training, we must have a posture of trusting and being patient with the Holy Spirit to reveal what is true to all of us according to His timing.
We can continue to nurture a meaningful relationship with the person and support that person in seeking greater goodness where he or she asks for help.
In the meantime, we can get busy helping our church offer something truly better!
To be frank, if your church isn’t offering anything better to LGBT+ people yet, why would that person ever want to steward his or her sexuality differently?
Start by calling straight Christians to meaningful, life-giving, and often inconvenient sexual stewardship and making your church a place where celibate Christians (gay or straight) can find meaningful community.
