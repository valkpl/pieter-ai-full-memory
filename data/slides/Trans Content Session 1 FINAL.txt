Navigating Gender Incongruence &Caring for Trans* People

[Notes]
Hello, I am Jesse White
I’m Equip’s Trans* Content Specialist

Welcome to “Navigating Gender Incongruence & Caring for Trans* People” with Equip
We want to help Christian leaders and parents think wisely and empathetically about gender incongruence
And we want to equip Christian leaders and parents to offer God’s love and wisdom to those navigating gender incongruence and to trans*
While those Christian leaders and parents challenge their churches to grow their capacity to support trans* people in compassionate and theologically accurate ways
SESSION OBJECTIVES
1. Stories & Terminology
2. The Bible + Theology
3. Culture & Pastoral Care
4. Kids & Case Studies


[Notes]
Over the next four sessions, we’ll accomplish that by first hearing the stories of people navigating gender incongruence and grounding our conversation in shared terminology

During our second session, we’ll examine passages of Scripture often cited in conversations about gender ethics and we’ll share how Equip invites Christian leaders and pastors to think theologically about ministering to trans* people

In our third session, we’ll survey alternate Christian and non-Christian perspectives on gender ethics and share how you can better care for those navigating gender incongruence in your churches and families

Finally, in our fourth session, we’ll zoom in on caring for kids and teens who share about incongruence, and then we’ll conclude our sessions with a series of case studies spanning a range of scenarios you might encounter

A note about
confidence

[Notes]
before we get started, I want to make three additional notes

first, a note about confidenceover the past 10 years, a consensus of compassionate orthodoxy on same-sex attractions has coalescedEquip is 95% confident in our theological convictions when it comes to sexual minorities
but a consensus on compassionate orthodoxy on gender incongruence has not yet crystallizedthat's part of what Equip is doing by developing this resourceand giving specific answers to questions, even if we aren't 100% sure those answers are rightwe are attempting to contribute to building a consensus
but with that, we hold these conclusions less tightlywe are not certain that we've gotten this rightwe're certain we've gotten at least a couple of things wrongbut that is how the Church arrives at better answersby trying, and then workshopping those answersand then trying again
for the sake of trans* people, we have got to find better answersbecause a lack of answers has kept our churches from ministering to trans people in any meaningful wayout of fear, the Church been silentand in the process, trans people have suffered alone
we have to do betterand that starts with trying to find better answers, knowing the process will be messy
what does that mean?we're open to correctionand you don't have to align with us 100% to work with us

A note about
consistency

[Notes]
Second, a note about consistency

For those of you who agree with the convictions we’ll share in these sessionsor believe that God is calling Christians to even more conservative convictionscan I point out something?
if your convictions are based on the assertion that our biological sex and reproductive capacities are a gift from Godand that when those are functioning properly, it is a rejection of God's gift and therefore a sin to hormonally or surgically alter them…
If your convictions are that when our biological sex and reproductive capacities are, for the most part, as God intended,yet we respond by saying, "Hey God, I actually know better how my body should be. I am going to use the tools available to me to make my body the way I think it should be”,then what's the difference between cross-gender hormones and contraception
what’s the difference between sex-reassignment surgery and a vasectomy or breast enhancement?
can we really be against the first of those but not the second?to be clear, I'm not saying that all of those are wrong
but I am suggesting that we must be consistent

A note about terminology
Sex—Being male or female as defined by chromosomes, gonads, sexual anatomy, and secondary sex characteristics

Gender—Psychological, social, and cultural aspects of being male or female including gender identity

[Notes]
And finally, a note about terminology
During our sessions, I’m going to be using the terms sex, gender, trans, and gender incongruence most often
I want to be clear about what we at Equip mean when we use those words

First, I am using the words sex and gender in specific and different ways
When I refer to someone’s sex or biological sex, I am referring to a person being male or female as defined by chromosomes, gonads, sexual anatomy, and secondary sex characteristics
When I refer to someone’s gender, I am referring to the pychological, social, and cultural aspects of being male or female including gender identity (how you experience yourself and how masculine/feminine a person feels) and gender role (adoptions of cultural expectations for males/females). 



A note about terminology
Gender Incongruence – An acute sense that one's gender does not correspond with the experience typically associated with the person's biological sex

Transgender/Trans* – A general term for someone who experiences gender incongruence

[Notes]
When I use the phrase ”gender incongruence”, I’m referring to an acute sense that one's gender does not correspond with the experience typically associated with the person's biological sex
When I use the word ”transgender” or shortened to “trans” with an asterisk, I’m referring to a general term for someone who experiences gender incongruence
To be clear, when I use the word trans to refer to someone, I’m not communicating anything about their theological convictions or the extent to which they have transitioned
I am merely using that word to refer to a person who is navigating gender incongruence
I’ll use those words and phrases most commonly and interchangeably


PERSONALSTORIES

[Notes]
okay, let’s get started by familiarizing ourselves with the experience of trans people
my story

[Notes]
speaking of which, let me introduce myself further
I graduated from the College at Southeastern in 2021 with a Bachelors in Global Studies
I’m currently finishing up my Master’s in Marriage and Family Counseling at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary
Once I graduate and get my License in Marriage and Family Therapy, I hope to focus on abuse and trauma therapy
and then practice counseling as a missionary in Southeast Asia (hopefully Thailand or Cambodia)
Alongside working with Equip, I started a support group for sexual and gender minorities at my local church and offered training and equipping opportunities to the broader congregation on how to better engage gay and trans* people outside the church.
I’m driven by a desire for sexual and gender minorities to experience God’s love
Because that’s my story
Despite years of hurt and abuse from former churches as I’ve made sense of my same-sex attraction and my gender incongruence,
I have undeniably seen God’s faithfulness through His people
I want to equip churches to better care for gay and trans* people like me

My story of gender dysphoria begins at age eight. I remember playing with my sister and wanting to dress up as a princess with her. I put on one of her princess dresses, the “heels” that came with it, and started strutting around the house with her. My dad later had a conversation with me that said something to the effect that it was not ok for me to do that. He did not shame me or scold me, but explained why he believed men and boys should not dress in womens clothing. The only problem was I didn’t feel like a boy, but I believed in the bible and trusted my dad (as well as being a strict rule follower) so that was the end of it. 
Fast forward four years and I begin going through puberty. No one likes going through it, it’s hard and awkward and uncomfortable but for me, I despised it. I hated everything about my body. I hated the genetalia I had, hated the feelings I had for men, and wanted more than anything to be rid of my body hair and penis. This was complicated more by the fact that I was experiencing what I now know is a fairly common condition called galactorrhea which is when the body produces milk unrelated to childbirth. I was embarrassed, ashamed of my body, and wondering if God had made a mistake and I was actually supposed to be a girl. I had nowhere to take these thoughts and feelings, so I hid them away and ignored them. Over the course of the next several years, I actively avoided any scenario that required me to be shirtless or where I had to change clothes in front of people which is hard to do when you live by the beach. Even in the bathroom after showering, I refused to look at myself and my body in the mirror until I was fully clothed and because I didn’t fully comprehend my own incongruence, I had no way of understanding the source of these feelings. 
After starting college in 2016, I began working through my experience of being gay within a really solid community of friends and believers who love and care for me deeply. It was the first time I experienced depth of community and support around my queerness within the church ever and more than that, it was the first time I’d truly allowed God to enter into this space with me and work on removing my shame around my sexuality. For the next five years I began to experience hope and peace in ways I never had before. Then in August of 2021, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She has since recovered and is cancer free, but the initial news shocked me and brought up a repressed memory that I had of my galactorrhea. Immediately I was thrown right back into my shame and fear, but this time I knew the source and it terrified me. I began to doubt my relationships with people, became afraid of how I’d be treated if others found out, I feared losing my community and my faith, but most of all, I feared that I would no longer be loved by God if I pursued any sort of  transition steps. I became suicidal and withdrawn, having regular panic attacks in church and withdrawing from community out of fear and discomfort. I’m still in process with my incongruence, and I’m still uncertain about what my life will look like as I continuously work through this, but what has stayed the same is my faith and assurance that even in my doubting and uncertainty, God is always certain.

CASE STUDIES
Attitudes toward transitioning among Christians navigating gender incongruence vary. Anecdotally, I have friends who…
Have already transitioned socially and/or medically
Are currently in process of transitioning socially or medically
Want to transition socially and/or medically in the future
Plan not to transition

[Notes]
Mark Yarhouse, a respected clinical researcher on these topics, often says, “When you’ve met one trans person, you’ve met one trans person.”
And I have to agree
My story is just that: the story of one trans person
To familiarize you with a wider range of stories, I interviewed other Christians I know who are navigating gender incongruence

Among them, attitudes toward transitioning vary. Some of them have already transitioned socially and/or medically
Some are currently in process of transitioning socially or medically
Some want to transition socially and/or medically in the future
And some plan not to transition


What role has your faith played in processing your gender?
“I've grown in my appreciation for God's diversity in his creation. I've definitely thought a lot more about the creation narrative and how God's plans include places in the middle.”
“It's been very encouraging to see how Christ biblically invited in those traditionally excluded by society, and I haven't yet seen any persuasive biblical arguments to not transition, so I don't see any conflict between my faith and my transition.”

[Notes]
When I asked them, “What role has your faith played in processing your gender?”
here’s how some of them responded:

“It's been very encouraging to see how Christ biblically invited in those traditionally excluded by society, and I haven't yet seen any persuasive biblical arguments to not transition, so I don't see any conflict between my faith and my transition.”


What role has your faith played in processing your gender?
“I was unable to move forward in processing my Gender until I felt confident that God would still love me. My faith did, and still does, come first. In being able to see God has accepting and loving gender-expansiveness, it's given me the freedom to explore my own.”

[Notes]

“I was unable to move forward in processing my Gender until I felt confident that God would still love me. My faith did, and still does, come first. In being able to see God has accepting and loving gender-expansiveness, it's given me the freedom to explore my own.”
What role has the Church played in processing your gender?
“My church has been really great in affirming my name (we have a rite of renaming in our service books). It would have been nice to have more places to discuss what masculinity means to me.”

What role has the Church played in processing your gender?
“It has not been a safe place. It was an obstacle and being able to accept myself. I had to leave the church I grew up in for many reasons, including it being unsafe for Gender expansive individuals. I fear backlash and anger from many of my former church family if I were to fully come out on all social media platforms.”

“Almost none. It’s been a source of anxiety”

How has the Church supported you in processing your gender?
Each shared about a lack of support from their church.

[Notes]
When I asked, “How has the Church supported you in processing your gender?”
Each, unfortunately, shared about a lack of support from their church.


How has the Church failed to support you or hindered you in processing your gender?
“I go to a more liberal church where it was very natural for them to support me when I started to transition. I would have appreciated being in an environment where people asked me more questions.”

“The church as an structured institution has not given me space to explore outside the cishet box they see as safe. The global Church I found in online community was essential in helping me come out to myself and still feel loved and wanted by others and by God.”

How has the Church failed to support you or hindered you in processing your gender?
“The institutional church has almost never felt like a space where I could ask questions and have space to process them, or where I could be open about my thoughts and feelings without receiving suspicion.”

[Notes]
Another said:
“The institutional church has almost never felt like a space where I could ask questions and have space to process them, or where I could be open about my thoughts and feelings without receiving suspicion.”


What is something that still provides you with hope?
“I know that I'm not alone in my community, and that is something that leaves me feeling very hopeful.”

“Jesus' radical acceptance of all who put their faith in Him, regardless of and sometimes in spite of your status in society. I KNOW He loves me, as I was and as I will be. I hope to one day be a friendly, approachable, and nonthreatening face of transition to the church, demonstrating that we're not evil or dangerous, we're just people.”

What is something that still provides you with hope?
“That one day God will reveal His Truth. And that whether or not my interpretation of scripture is correct or not, the blood of Christ covers any misunderstanding or misreading. Whether I be wrong or right, I can rest in Christ's forgiveness.”

“Individual Christians who learn and listen. I have great hope in my faith in that Jesus knows our experiences, will never leave us, and ultimately even if I am unknowingly wrong in my choices, he offers me restoration.”

As you can see, there is broad variety among the experiences of trans people
Even if you personal know a couple of trans people, I encourage you not to assume you understand the experiences of every trans person
Approach each new friendship as a learner
And let your heart continue to be moved by the pain of their story and the beauty of their faithfulness

Thankfully, stories of people like me are being heard more and more today.
But unfortunately, the backlash that we experience is more than that of any other type of queer person.
Trans* individuals have become the focus of a ton of legislature, political debates, business conversations, church sermons, and more,
typically focusing on the negative implications of allowing surgeries, shared bathrooms in schools,
allowing trans participants in women’s sports, the effect on feminism, the list goes on and on.

What is not talked about issues that actually affect trans* people on a daily basis:

PERSONAL STORIES
41% of trans* people attempt suicide, as compared to 1.6% of the general population

Trans* suicide rates rose even higher for those who lost a job due to:
bias (55%) 
were harassed/bullied in school (51%)
had low household income (61%) 
were the victim of physical assault (61%) 
or were the victim of sexual assault (65%)

PERSONAL STORIES
Trans* people are generally at greater risk of mental illness, experiencing higher rates of (compared to the general population): 
borderline personality disorder
schizophrenia 
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
autism spectrum disorder

[Notes]
Trans people are generally at greater risk of mental illness, experiencing higher rates of
borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD),
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
and autism spectrum disorder compared to the general population. 


21
PERSONAL STORIES
Within the LGBTQ+ community, trans* people are at a higher risk for self-harm and external victimization. 

Homicides of trans* and gender-nonconforming people have increased by 93% in the US over the last four years. 

While only 13% of the transgender community is estimated to be Black, ~75% of homicide victims were Black trans* women.

[Notes]
Of the LGBTQ+ community, trans people are at a higher risk for self-harm and external victimization

A summary article released by CBS News states “Everytown's Transgender Homicide Tracker found that
there was a 93% increase in tracked homicides of trans and gender-nonconforming people in the United States and Puerto Rico over the last four years.

In 2021, 56 people were killed, compared to 29 reported deaths in 2017.
Notably, while only 13% of the transgender community is estimated to be Black,
according to UCLA School of Law's Williams Institute,
Black trans women accounted for nearly three-quarters of the known victims.”

22
PERSONAL STORIES
How should pastors and parents respond, in light of high suicide rates and violence against trans* people?

Longitudinal studies have found that transition does not reduce suicide risk, and may even exacerbate it.

Instead, first focus on addressing any mental health vulnerabilities directly with interventions proven to be effective while delaying transition decisions until a time of health.

[Notes]
We can see from these statistics that more than any other people group,
trans people experience an excess of mental health and suicide concerns.

This piece of the trans* experience can often be ignored
or used as the explanation behind why an individual is experiencing gender incongruence.
Neither provides holistic care for the individual.

Frequently, transitioning is encouraged as a way to alleviate these mental health concerns.
However, only a few longitudinal studies of transition outcomes have been conducted.

The largest and most rigorous found that only 6% of those who transitioned experienced significant improvement in mental health.
Interestingly, a majority of those with persisting mental health diagnosis actually developed those after transitioning.
Unfortunately, evidence demonstrates that transition does not meaningfully improve mental health.
Furthermore, some studies have shown that transitioning worsens mental and physical health.
A study by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found that those who transitioned experienced
“substantially higher rates of overall mortality, death from cardiovascular disease and suicide, suicide attempts, and psychiatric hospitalizations”
compared to the control group, with a subsequent study finding that elevated suicide risk persisted for ten or more years after transition.

Further study is needed, but available evidence suggests
that transition does not effectively reduce suicide risk, and may even exacerbate it.
Instead, those offering care to trans people struggling with mental health challenges should first focus
on addressing the mental illness directly with interventions proven to be effective
while helping the trans person accept that transition is at best ineffective to address mental illness and at worst a contributor to mental illness.

IMAGINATION EXERCISE
1. How many of you have ever felt like you have fallen short of masculine/feminine expectations? But did any of you ever question whether you were supposed to be a boy or a girl? What if you genuinely did? What if there was an undeniable sense that your sex and gender didn’t match? How difficult would that make life?

2. How difficult would life be if you felt like you weren't right at a core level? If growing up you never felt like you belonged among the girls or the boys? If you faced huge developmental challenges because of your experience? If you faced one of the highest rates of suicide and hate crime among any American sub-population?

[Notes]
Particularly for those of you who don’t experience gender incongruence, I want to lead you through an imagination exercise
to help you empathize with trans* people
As I read through five prompts, I invite you to close your eyes, listen, and imagine if these were your stories

1. How many of you have ever felt like you have fallen short of masculine/feminine expectations? But did any of you ever question whether you were supposed to be a boy or a girl? What if you genuinely did? What if there was an undeniable sense that your sex and gender didn’t match? How difficult would that make life?

2. How difficult would life be if you felt like you weren't right at a core level? If growing up you never felt like you belonged among the girls or the boys? If you faced huge developmental challenges because of your experience? If you faced one of the highest rates of suicide and hate crime among any American sub-population?
3. How difficult would life be if you read in the Bible that God makes people male or female but you feel like you are neither?  Do you think that would make it hard for you to love a God who allowed this to happen?

4. What if every time you got ready, every time you introduced yourself, every time you went to the bathroom, etc. you felt like you were living a lie?

5. What if someone asked you the following: How does dating work? When did you know? Have you had surgery? What was the surgery like? What do you do when you need to go to the bathroom? Do you have a penis?

Feel free to pause the video, take a few minutes, and continue to connect with the feelings and thoughts that this exercise brought up.

If you’re working through these sessions in a group, feel free to share with others what feelings and thoughts came up.
DEFINING TERMS

[Notes]
For the rest of this first session, I want to explore different terminology and language that people use in conversation about gender incongruence
to make sure we have a good foundation of shared language
To be clear, I’m not offering these definitions to suggest they are the best definitions
Or the only ways to define these words
I just want to be clear about what I’ll mean throughout these sessions when I use certain words

26
STATS & GENDERAL INFO
1.6% of the US population identifies as trans*

73% of trans* people are attracted to the same biological sex.

Some of taken some steps to transition, others have taken none.

Some identify as one gender, other neither, other both, and still others somewhere in between.

[Notes]
Currently, around 1.6% of the US adult population identifies as transgender, and among those there is a great diversity of experiences.

Transgender people may be straight, gay, bisexual, asexual, polysexual, pansexual, etc.
According to a survey conducted by the National LGBTQ Task force and the National Center for Transgender Equality,
” 23% of transgender people surveyed said they were gay, lesbian, or same gender loving, 25% said bisexual, 4% said asexual and 23% said queer
2% said their sexual orientation was something else such as trans-attracted…
(making a total of 73% trans* individuals attracted to people of the same biological sex)
and 23% of trans participants attracted to people of the opposite biological sex”

Some have taken steps to align their sex with their experienced gender,
others have completely transitioned, and still others continue with a sex and gender that feel mismatched.

Transgender people may identify as one gender, neither, both, or somewhere in between.

27
TERMINOLOGY
Gender Dysphoria – A medical term for a clinically impairing experience of distress associated with the incongruence wherein one’s psychological and emotional gender identity does not match one’s biological sex. Many in the transgender community push back against this term and use it as a diagnosis, claiming that it pathologizes the transgender experience as a mental disorder.

[Notes]
If you’ll check out your handout for this session, there’s a big long list of terms and definitions
I’ve already highlighted some key terms earlier in this session: sex, gender, gender incongruence, and trans
I want to highlight two other key terms
first, Gender Dysphoria is a medical term for a clinically impairing experience of distress associated with the incongruence wherein one’s psychological and emotional gender identity does not match one’s biological sex. Many in the transgender community push back against this term and use it as a diagnosis, claiming that it pathologizes the transgender experience as a mental disorder.
For those reasons, we prefer and will use the phrase “gender incongruence” in these sessions



28
TERMINOLOGY
Discomfort with Gender Overprescription – regardless of one's gender experience, individuals may notice that cultural prescriptions for gender roles are arbitrarily narrow, chafe at that overprescription, and search for alternative conceptions of gender that more accurately reflect universal and innate experiences. Trans* people will undoubtedly experience discomfort with gender overprescription in addition to their internal experience of gender incongruence. Cisgender people may also experience discomfort with gender overprescription absent an internal experience of gender incongruence. 

[Notes]
Second I want to distinguish between gender incongruence and more generally a Discomfort with Gender Overprescription
regardless of one's gender experience, individuals may notice that cultural prescriptions for gender roles are arbitrarily narrow, chafe at that overprescription, and search for alternative conceptions of gender that more accurately reflect universal and innate experiences. Trans* people will undoubtedly experience discomfort with gender overprescription in addition to their internal experience of gender incongruence. Cisgender people may also experience discomfort with gender overprescription absent an internal experience of gender incongruence. 


QUESTIONS
1. What terms are new to you?
2. Which are you most comfortable with? Least comfortable?
3. Were you aware that intersex people exist?
4. Why do you think the trans* community pushes back against the term “gender dysphoria”? 

[Notes]
there’s about 20 more terms and definitions in your handout,
including a section at the end of experiences adjacent to gender incongruence
to be clear, these categories should not be conflated with the trans* experience

Please take some time to read through all of these terms and definitions, and then reflect individually or with others on the following questions:
1. What terms are new to you?
2. Which are you most comfortable with? Least comfortable?
3. Were you aware that intersex people exist?
4. Why do you think the trans* community pushes back against the term “gender dysphoria”? 








SESSION OBJECTIVES
1. Stories & Terminology
2. The Bible + Theology
3. Culture & Pastoral Care
4. Kids & Case Studies


[Notes]
That concludes our first session
In the next session, we’ll examine passages of Scripture often cited in conversations about gender ethics and we’ll share how Equip invites Christian leaders and pastors to think theologically about ministering to trans* people

Thanks for your time and willingness to lean into this conversation for the sake of offering God’s love and wisdom to trans* people
I hope you’ll jump back in with our second session soon!
