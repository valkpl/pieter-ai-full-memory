12

[Notes]
development not so you can dissect people, but seeing factors useful in ministering

story: empathize with sexual minorities, impact of family, church, and society, how easily I could have become someone else (empathize and provide scaffolding)
development: see how little choice sexual minorities have, identify common experiences with self (demystify and see commonalities)
both of these give you a better foundation for ministering to sexual minorities
Hear a Story

[Notes]
Pain and redemption
Not over
Very common
Questions to Consider
What aspects of the story are similar to your own?
What significant events/relationships contributed to the development of SSA?
How did the Church fail to respond (both parents and pastors)?
Can you empathize with the pain and suffering?

[Notes]
development: see how little choice sexual minorities have, identify common experiences with self
Development of SSA
Correlated but not necessarily causal
At least 4 of 6 factors involved in 90% of cases
Every process is unique
Common among OSA individuals

[Notes]
Matheson believes causal, but hard to prove (has not yet been published)
adaptation
Development of SSA

[Notes]
Connecting to my story but apply to women
Woven in all of these effects of spiritual attack, sins of others, personal sin, and generational sin
Often seems like Satan is the orchestrator of the perfect storm that these factors contribute to

Development of SSA
Inaccurate Perceptions of Genders
Incongruence with same gender
different, not part of, uncomfortable, mysterious
Lack of distinction from opposite gender
same, dangerous, nothing to offer, not complementary
gender: traits, roles, and expectations learned from family and society

[Notes]
Healthy: See men as same, belong, enough, comfortable
Healthy: identify and distinguish: exotic, different, complimentary, give and take

temperament and aptitude

[Notes]
Gay gene has not been found

I can speak with authority
Doubt this factor alone could cause SSA

Development of SSA
Sexualization (Psychological Learning)
We associate ideas and adopt behaviors based on our experiences, which are reinforced by rewards and punishments
Neurons that fire together wire together

[Notes]
we learn some aspects of our sexuality
associate things that weren’t once linked

Anxiety and fear -> erections
Previous factor -> insecurity and inferiority
Confident guys -> anxiety -> erection
Society says erection = attraction

Very common
Teenagers = hormones
Pornography
Perfect men in heterosexual porn

Female vs Male SSA

Attractions, Emotional Dependency, and Sexual Behavior

Search for Home

The Heart of Female Same-sex Attraction

[Notes]
Home = stability, trust, protection, and safety in mother and father

Without, in search of home -> codependent relationships with other women

healthy attachment with same-sex parent crucial.
