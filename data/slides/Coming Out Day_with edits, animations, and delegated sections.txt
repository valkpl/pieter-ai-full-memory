A Christian Response to
Gay Pride and Coming Out

[Notes]
Pieter:

I couple of quick notes before we begin:
Bathrooms
Coffee + donuts from Thrivent
We are recording but will not publicly post any of your comments during discussion
If you didn’t register and we didn’t get your email address, please do that on your way out

Hello, I am Pieter Valk

I studied at Vanderbilt University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and Lipscomb University
I have my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and one day a week I meet with LGBT+ undergraduate students at a Christian university navigating questions of faith, sexuality, and identity

And the rest of the week, I’m the Executive Director of EQUIP
A team of missionary consultants committed to equipping the Church with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction
Or to put it another way
We partner with churches to help them become places where LGBT+ people can belong and thrive according to an orthodox Christian sexual ethic

Vision
Why this matters to me

Many of you in this room get why this matters. And you’ve demonstrated that by volunteering with EQUIP or supporting this work financially. From the very beginning of today’s conversation, we want to say THANK YOU. Our work and educational events like this would be possible without your support. If you’ve volunteered with EQUIP or supported us financially, would you stand? APPLAUSE

Today, I’m excited to be tag-teaming with my friend Amber

Amber:

I’m Amber Carroll, EQUIP’s Volunteer Coordinator.  I also write and edit content and teach sometimes. I’m also a member of Resonate Church here in Nashville, where I serve as the Admin Assistant and as a lay leader in various capacities.
This topic, responding to gay pride and coming out stories, matters to me because I have close friends and family members, including my ex-husband, who are gay, and I care deeply about them.  I’ve seen what happens when Christians don’t respond well to coming out stories. I also have children, and if one of them happens to be gay, I want our churches and the Christians in them to be places they will feel free to come out, to talk about sexuality, and be offered good and beautiful ways to steward their sexuality 
How many of you have had someone come out to you before today? Raise hands.
I’ve had several people come out to me, and I’ve had the honor of being the first person someone has ever come out to three times in my life.
Over the past decade, I’ve had many people text, call, or email me to ask how they should respond to a friend or church member or coworker or family member that has come out.
-“I’m not sure what I should say.”  “How do I let them know what I believe?”  “Is it ok to talk about it?” “How do I love them well?”
-It seems that, often, Christians just don’t really know how to respond to a coming out story.  If we did, I wouldn’t get so many questions about it.



Why this matters
Christians should be the ones responding the “most well”

People matter




[Notes]
Amber

That’s why our conversation today matters
-LGBT+ people will come out to us
-But Christians shouldn’t be afraid of coming out stories.  We should be the ones responding the “most well” if you will.
-And this matters because people matter.  Christians are a gospel people, and we want all that we do to be saturated with the grace of the gospel and with the fathomless love of Christ.  Our reactions should be colored by humility and sincerity. Every single person who comes out to you is a fellow image-bearer of God. People matter.

How are we going to help prepare you to response compassionately when people come out to you?
-First, You’re going to hear some personal coming out stories.
-To give you some background, we’ll explore the dynamic between the Church and LGBT+ people over the past century
-We’ll learn why people come out, and some of the risks gay people face when coming out.
-We’ll talk about gay Pride.
-And with that understanding, we’ll discover how you can respond compassionately when someone chooses to share their story with you.
-We’ll talk about some Dos and Dont’s in our responses.
-We’ll practice in small groups using real coming out stories
-And we’ll talk about ways the Church can offer something better to those who experience SSA.

Let’s start with some personal stories.



STORIES


[Notes]
Amber

We want to start with hearing the personal stories of real people to remind all of us that behind every story
Behind every coming-out
Is a real person
And that act of sharing one’s story, is very personal

You’ll hear stories from two of EQUIP’s volunteers, Lindsey and Jim. They’re both gay Christians who are stewarding their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic. Today, we’ve asked each of them to share with us their most powerfully painful coming out story and their most powerfully beautiful coming out story.

Sharing stories that are this personal can be hard, especially when sharing to a room full of strangers.  It takes courage to be so open and transparent.  As each of them come up and share, feel free to offer a short prayer of strength and encouragement.



LINDSEY


[Notes]
Amber:

Lindsey, why don’t you come on up. Lindsey runs EQUIP’s social media, so if you’ve been following our Facebook page, those updates are thanks to Lindsey. If you haven’t liked and followed our Facebook page, be sure to that, so that you can stay connected to the work and learn about ways to get involved.



JIM


[Notes]
Amber:

Lindsey, that you so much. Now I want to invite Jim up. Jim put together our Kitchen Table Conversation Kit, a DIY Kit friends of EQUIP can use to host conversations about faith and sexuality with your friends. He’s also our Conversation Coach, so if you’re interested in downloading the Kit, hosting a conversation, and getting help from Jim, you can email him at ktc@equipyourcommunity.org.

[Notes]

We’ve heard some personal coming out stories from Lindsey and Jim, and now we’re going to talk about some basics--definitions of common terms, what coming out is—and some background—including LGBT history and the risks of coming out.



BASICS




Basics: Terms
Gay
SSA or same-sex attraction
Straight
LGBT+
Sexual orientation




[Notes]
Pieter

Today, we’ll be using several words and phrases you’ve probably at least heard before.  I want to be clear about what we mean when we use those words and phrases, so I’ll be defining them for you.
Our definitions aren’t the only definitions or even the best definitions; but this is the way we’ll be using these terms today.

-gay – someone who is exclusively or most significantly attracted to the same sex; when we use gay, it isn’t assumed that the person is in or seeking any sort of sexual relationship.  We’re using the term to talk about attractions/orientation only.
-SSA or same-sex attracted – a term used mostly by those in Christian circles; commonly used by those who consider attractions toward the same gender to be a sin struggle
-straight – attracted exclusively or most significantly to the opposite sex; again, it isn’t assumed that the person is in or seeking any sort of sexual relationship.  The term is about attraction/orientation only.
-LGBT+ – a common acronym used when referring to the larger group of sexual/ gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and + refers to several other sexual/gender minorities such as queer, asexual, etc)
-orientation – the enduring pattern of romantic and sexual attractions (homosexual/gay orientation, heterosexual/straight orientation)
-Today, I’ll be using “gay”, “LGBT”, and “someone who experiences SSA” interchangeably.



Basics: Coming Out
Coming out is the process of recognizing, accepting, and sharing with others one’s sexual orientation

Coming out usually happens in stages
Coming out to oneself
Choosing to disclose one’s orientation to others
Beginning to live in ways that reflect one’s orientation




[Notes]
Pieter

So now that we have some terms defined, let’s look at what coming out actually is.

Coming out is the process of recognizing, accepting, and sharing with others one’s sexual orientation

-Coming out usually happens in stages:
First: Coming out to oneself. This is an internal process.  Maybe a 6th-grade boy realizes he’s not into girls like the other boys are.  Maybe a high-school girl finally understands why she’s had so much trouble feeling like all the other girls say they feel.
Second: Choosing to disclose one’s sexual orientation to others.  Disclosing usually isn’t a one-time thing, and it can be a lifelong process.  Generally, gay people have to come out multiple times - maybe first to parents, then to a pastor or best friend, then to extended family, to classmates, to co-workers.  Maybe even publicly via a blog post or by bringing a same-sex date to a dance or wedding.
And Third: Beginning to live in ways that reflect one’s orientation.  This might look like choosing to use the term “gay” or “lesbian” to describe one’s experience.  Seeking out friends and community among other LGBT individuals. Leaning into one’s interests - including those that don’t “match” what culture has deemed typical. Giving oneself permission to see other LGBT people/characters as “like me” and enjoying that likeness.  Letting go of shame and the need to avoid anything that is associated with gayness; allowing oneself to enjoy TV shows or artists or characters that are about and for gay people.

coming out is a big part of a person’s story – when they choose to come out, they’re choosing to share with others, to be fully known by others in hopes of being fully loved by others.  If we don’t share all of who we are, we will always question whether we’re loved totally, or only for the parts we allow others to see.

And we need to remember that too often, those who experience SSA don’t choose to come out, but are “outed” by someone else.

BACKGROUND


[Notes]
Amber

Now for some background information on coming out – some LGBT history and what that means for coming out today



Background
LGBT+ History
Why does it matter?
Christian treatment of LGBT+ people over the past 70 years

Historically, coming out has been dangerous




[Notes]
Amber

-Throughout history, LGBT+ people have been marginalized by society, mistreated, told that they’re less than.  They’ve been told by the majority that they are different and that they need to find their own spaces. So, as a means of survival and finding belonging, LGBT+ people developed their own distinct culture and community, which in turn gives us LGBT history.

-Why does LGBT+ history matter?
-Sexual minorities today feel solidarity with sexual minorities of the past.  “This happened to US.”
-Grant, a Christian gay man, said, “I can look on history and see myself in people.  If I had been born in the 50s, I would have been fired from my job, been outed in the newspapers, and probably gone to gay bars because that’s the only place I would have felt safe.”
-We often have communal identities because of the experiences we share with people in history; this is especially true for minority groups.
-It’s helpful for us (straight Christians) to understand LGBT+ history so we can understand why coming out has been dangerous and why gay people often distrust Christians and the Church

-You can actually get a PhD in Gender and Sexuality Studies, so we won’t be able to cover the topic completely in the next five minutes.  I’ve narrowed our focus to a quick overview of the history between Christians and LGBT+ people over the past 70 years in the United States. My hope is that we’ll better understand why coming out to a Christian is really hard and why it can be difficult for those who experience same-sex attraction to trust the institution of the church.
-Historically (and presently), LGBT+ people have been treated very poorly by the Christians.  Coming out has been dangerous.



Background
50s and 60s
Lavender Scare
Police harassment and gay bar raids
General discrimination




[Notes]
Amber

We’ll start with the 1950s 

-Christians didn't stand up for gay and lesbian people during the Lavender Scare of the 50s. An executive order signed by President Eisenhower implied that gay and lesbian people were security risks and communist sympathizers, and allowed for mass firings of gay and lesbian federal employees.

-Police harassment and raids of gay bars were routine in the 1960s.  Again, Christians said nothing.

-Homosexuality was considered a mental disorder. Sodomy laws were still firmly in place in most states.  It was common for gay and lesbian people to be fired or evicted on the basis of their orientation. 
Many Christians participated directly in these firings and evictions, or at least supported them.  But even those who didn’t generally stood by silently, unwilling to confront the injustices or seek change to the way LGBT people were treated.



Background
70s and 80s
Upstairs Lounge fire
Anita Bryant’s “Save Our Children” campaign
Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority and the rise of the religious right
AIDS crisis




[Notes]
Amber

-In 1973, the Upstairs Lounge, which was hosting a church service for LGBTs, was intentionally set on fire.  32 people died.  Some in the media joked about the tragedy, calling it Dante’s Inferno and dismissing the tragedy because “you know it was a queer bar.”  Organizers called many churches, but only one church in the area agreed to allow a memorial to be held there.

Anita Bryant, a singer, beauty pageant winner, and brand ambassador for the Florida Citrus Commission, was voted the Most Admired Woman in America for three years in a row by Good Housekeeping magazine, and one of America’s Most Influential Women in a Gallup poll.  Upstanding Christian woman by all accounts.  In 1977, she ran the “Save Our Children” campaign in opposition to a Dade County Florida ordinance that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Some of her words: “What these people really want…is the legal right to propose to our children that theirs is an acceptable way of life.” and “Homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore they must recruit our children.”  She even compared gays and lesbians to “people who sleep with St. Bernards.” Her campaign worked – the anti-discrimination ordinance was repealed.

-The Moral Majority is founded by Jerry Falwell in 1979 and this helps usher in the rise of the religious right in the 80s.  Falwell supported Anita Bryant’s campaign saying, “Gay folks would just as soon kill you as look at you.”

-In the 80s, as the AIDS crisis hit the gay community, there was a serious lack of compassionate response from Christians.  Many saw the disease as God's punishment. Jerry Falwell said, “AIDS is not just God’s punishment for homosexuals, it is God’s punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals.”
-By the end of the 80s, Christians became synonymous with hatred and oppression 



Background
90s and forward
Ex-gay movement
Pulse nightclub shooting




[Notes]
Amber

-The 90s and early 2000s brought about the ex-gay movement, which included reparative therapy, conversion therapy, and language debates, all heavily influenced by the Church.  The ex-gay movement sought to eliminate same-sex sexual desires, sometimes by using electroshock therapy; marriage to someone of the opposite sex was considered proof of change. Emphasis was put on “strengthening your sense of masculine or feminine identity” through culturally typical male or female activities and mannerisms.  The Church demanded gay and lesbian people to “act straight” before allowing them into community.

-And just two years ago, in June 2016, 49 people were murdered at Pulse, an LGBT nightclub in Orlando.  Many churches responded with well-meaning messages, but most left out the fact that those killed were LGBT or jumped directly to talking about “the problem of gun violence” rather than lamenting that a specific minority group was targeted and mourning with the families of the victims.  Some Christian leaders also felt the need to proclaim their disagreement with “the homosexual lifestyle” in their responses to the massacre.

-From these few examples, we can see that, historically, coming out has been dangerous.





Background
Today, coming out remains risky



Violence
Bullying
Harassment
Homelessness


Family rejection
Discrimination
Misunderstanding

[Notes]
Amber

Even today, coming out remains risky

How so?
-Coming out is associated with some very real dangers: violence, bullying, harassment, homelessness, family rejection, discrimination, misunderstanding.
-There are many, many stories of teens and young adults experiencing physical violence and even being killed at the hands of their parents, classmates, co-workers, and strangers after coming out or showing signs of their orientation.



Background
Who is most at risk?






Two leading risk factors for LGBT+ teen suicide:
Bullying
Family rejection

[Notes]
Amber

Who is most at risk?  Teens and young adults
-As many as 86% of LGBT+ teens experience verbal harassment in their schools.  25% report being physically attacked at school. Some students are bullied so badly, they change schools. 
-85% of LGBT youth in evangelical families felt uncomfortable coming out to parents, Over half feared being disowned (almost 10% actually were kicked out of their homes), 42% were forbidden to share their orientation with others (GF, p17)
-The two leading risk factors for LGBT teen suicide: bullying and family rejection (GF, p 17).  Youth who experience same-sex attraction are 2-4x more vulnerable to suicide than their straight peers.  But they are 8x more vulnerable if family rejection occurs. (GF, p28)
-Upon coming out, LGBT people can also experience shock, confusion, and misunderstanding from family and friends; harassment, discrimination, and have their credibility questioned by their co-workers, bosses, and teachers; and be seen as sick, immoral, or perverted by their religious community.  Unfortunately, these experiences aren’t rare.
-Here are some personal stories:
-Wells, a man who experiences same-sex attraction, is married to a woman, and is a leader in his church said, “I shared my story with one of my then-closest friends.  He was so concerned I was going to ‘jump him’ sexually that he broke our relationship.”
-Tyler, a former church member and now an out gay man, said he most feared humiliation, loss of career opportunities, and loss of community.  “I always felt inferior to other guys in all-male settings within the Church because I found no acceptance of effeminate guys, especially those that enjoyed beauty and art and music.  I always felt like I had to be some "macho" version of myself that I never really was interested in anyway, so I hid myself in academics.”
-Josh, who was raised Catholic and is now an out gay man, said, “I feared I would be disconnected from my community, my church, and my family.  I thought that God hated me. I thought that my parents and family would disown me. I thought my dad would kick me out of my home and never speak to me again.  Growing up, being gay was synonymous with AIDS. And in my adolescent brain, I thought being gay would be a death sentence.
Organized religion was a barrier for me.  I have distinct memory of our priest condemning homosexuality.  I prayed that God would change my heart and me. And by praying, I mean that for me, the prayer felt more like a plea for my life.  ‘God, either kill me or take the gay away.’ There was this fear and desperation in my prayer. I did this for years. This all contributed to feelings of shame and unworthiness.”
-Carl, who was raised in a Southern Baptist church (and whose dad is a deacon), said, “It was always in the back of my mind that when I came out to my family I would lose my home or never get to speak to my family again.  Family is a big part of my life, and I don’t know how I would cope with not being able to speak to them. I’ve also met friends who have come out to their dads and they would literally get beaten for it. I guess technically I haven’t come out to my dad.  He was always the one I was worried about. I’m more scared of his reaction to it than scared of actually telling him.”

These are some really heavy stories.  Let them soak in for a minute.  PAUSE

How to Respond Compassionately
Practice: Real Stories




[Notes]
Pieter

We’ve heard personal coming out stories, looked at some basic terms, and talked about the dangers associated with coming out.
Now let’s look at why people choose to come out.



COME OUT?


[Notes]
Pieter

What do people gain from coming out?  If there are devastating risks involved, why not just hide one’s sexual orientation?



Why Come Out?
What is gained from coming out?
Alleviating stress
Honesty
More genuine relationships
Connecting with others who experience same-sex attraction
Healthier intimacy with God




[Notes]
Pieter

-Alleviating stress– constantly worrying about being outed and making sure the mask is always tightly on is very stressful.  “Relief” is one of the most common words I hear gay and lesbian people use after they come out for the first time.
	Wells, a man who experiences same-sex attraction and is a leader in his church said, “Hiding takes a lot of work, way more work than being honest.”
-Honesty--with themselves and others.  Josh said, “To stay in the closet means denying everyone around you the true you.”  Honesty and transparency allow for deeper, more genuine relationships with friends and family.  Being out means that you are seen and known.
-More genuine relationship
	Carl, a man who is out to most of his friends and family, said, “It means the world to me to not have to hide who I am when we go out places.”
-Coming out may be the most commonly shared cultural experience that defines modern gay identity; connecting with others who are “like me” helps, as one gay man put it, “you find your own voice.”
-Authenticity with self, others, and God allows for healthier intimacy with God.  And that’s always a good thing.




Why Come Out?
Pride and coming out
A distinct LGBT+ culture has developed
Pride is much deeper than parades and rainbow flags

What are LGBT+ people proud of?




[Notes]
Pieter

Obviously a big way the average person experiences coming out is through Pride.  We talked about how the third stage of coming out involves beginning to live in ways that reflect one’s orientation.  Pride is often one of those ways.
It’s helpful for us to talk about what Gay Pride is so that you can better know how to respond.

-Understanding Pride and coming out
-One of the questions I get a lot is about Pride.  “I don’t understand it. Why do they need to be proud?  The Bible tells us that we’re only to boast in Jesus and that we should seek to be humble.”-The concept of Pride seems to be one of the least understood among straight Christians, and it’s one that we should seek to understand before commenting on it.
-Understanding is key.  Until we understand what LGBT+ people have endured, we don’t really understand the need for Pride.  Look through the lens of LGBT history as you think about Pride.

-Over time, a distinct LGBT culture has developed.
-Mainstream culture marginalized those who came out, treated them differently, and told them that they were less than and other.  The majority said, “You’re not the same; go find your own space because we don’t want you in ours.” To find community, belonging, family, love, and even survival, LGBT+ people found one another, and around them, as they did life together, a distinct culture arose.  Christians’ responses were the same: you don’t belong in our churches; we refuse to acknowledge your existence - if you are here, don’t tell anyone.
-Let’s be clear: It was good that LGBT+ found somewhere to belong. LGBT+ culture is not perfect, by any means, but in response to rejection from society and Christians merely for their attractions, God is pleased that they found some way to find community, because God made us for community.
-But now that gay culture has solidified into a distinct subculture of American life, the majority is saying has decided they have changed their mind: “You’re no different from the rest of.  Why do you need your own culture? You should be content to exist in our spaces.”
-Do you see the ridiculousness of pushing people away and then criticizing them for being at a distance?  PAUSE
-Pride goes much deeper than parades and rainbow flags.  And the Pride we’re talking about isn’t the opposite of humility.  It’s about saying, “We’re here. Together.  And we‘re surviving.”

>What are LGBT+ people proud of and why?  Here’s what some gay people had to say:
-Tyler, a former conservative church member and out, gay man: “Pride is a declaration of existence.  It’s a reminder of the humanity of this group of people. Because being gay has been smeared out of the heteronormative world, you can’t just say ‘I’m gay’ in a neutral way.  It has to be an over-the-top ‘We’re here!’ It’s a reaction to years of oppression. Had culture not been so oppressive and in denial that LGBT+ people existed, Pride wouldn’t actually be necessary.
-Grant, a Christian man who is gay and celibate: “The vision of LGBT activists is about solidarity of shared experience and identifying with a larger group, not sex.”
-Carl said, “Pride to me is just being happy and comfortable in my own skin.”



Why Come Out?
How do we understand the celebratory and militant nature of Pride?
Celebration is an attempt to communicate worth to each other
Militancy is an attempt to defend and protect each other




[Notes]
Pieter

Most Christians can probably get on board with Pride being about solidarity of shared experience.  But what about the celebratory and militant aspects of Pride?  How do we understand those?

-Celebration is an attempt to communicate worth, value, and acceptance to each other.  Pride serves as a way LGBT people can celebrate their own culture and community.

-Militancy is an attempt to defend and protect each other.  Christians have been resistant to protecting LGBT+ people in law, so LGBT+ people who press for civil rights protections are seen by Christians as fighting against Christians.  It was secular LGBT+ people who fought to make their communities safe for LGBT+ people to live openly, and it was conservative Christians who fought hard against that. In many ways, secular LGBT+ people have acted more like the Church than the Church.  
-The result of this tension between LGBT+ people and Christians was and remains the main obstacle to faith.  The gay community became their church. The perception of Christianity is still stigmatized today among LGBT+ people because it comes from a place of hurt and trauma.
-The drive to protect one another from more pain at the hands of those who would oppress LGBT+ people manifests as militancy.

Why Come Out?
How to Respond Compassionately
Practice: Real Stories




[Notes]
Amber

We’ve talked about the basics and background of coming out, we’ve learned why people choose to come out, now let’s talk about how we can compassionately respond when someone chooses to share their sexual orientation with us.



RESPOND


[Notes]
Amber

So how do we respond when someone comes out to us?  With love and kindness.  Patience.  Gentleness.  (These are some of the fruits of the Spirit, by the way.)  We seek to respond as we see Jesus responding to others: with genuine compassion.




Christian Response
Respond with compassion
Our response is critical
“Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.” (Galatians 6:2)




[Notes]
Amber

-Our response is critical; it will determine the difference between safety and fear, peace or anxiety, love or a sense of rejection (GF, p1).
-As Christians, we should seek to “carry each other’s burdens”; responding with compassion is one way of doing that.




Christian Response
Words matter.  No language is neutral.
Psalm 141:3; Proverbs 12:18, 15:1, 16:24; Ephesians 4:29; Titus 3:2; James 1:26, 3:5

Choose real conversation over catchy clichés.





[Notes]
Amber

When we respond, our words matter
-When someone comes out to us, one of the very first things we do is speak back to them.  The words we choose to use matter. A lot. No language is neutral.
-The Bible is pretty serious about words, too.  Check out any of these verses.  Psalm 141 says, “Set a guard over my mouth, LORD.”  Proverbs 16 says, “Gracious words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.”  Ephesians 4 reminds us to use our words for “what is helpful for building others up.”
-We always want to choose real conversation over catchy clichés.



Christian Response
When we insist on using words or phrases that LGBT+ people themselves don’t use, we give off the impression that we aren’t listening, that we don’t care what they have to say.  And sometimes, we’re outright offensive.





[Notes]
Amber

-The Church (sometimes) has strong opinions about what words Christians who experience same-sex attraction are able to use and still call themselves Christians.  This builds barriers to faith and Christian community.
-When we insist on using words or phrases that LGBT+ people themselves don’t use, we give off the impression that we aren’t listening, that we don’t care what they have to say.  And sometimes we’re outright offensive.



Christian Response
Some examples
Homosexual
“Love the sinner, hate the sin.”
Struggler, gay lifestyle, lifestyle choice, sexual preference
“Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve”

If in doubt, ask what terms or labels a person prefers.




[Notes]
Amber

-Here’s some examples of words and phrases that LGBT don’t use and may find offensive:

-“homosexual” is often perceived as religious judgment; As one gay person put it, “Homosexual makes us only sexual.  Gay is who we are.” Use of LGBT language communicates who someone feels they belong with more than how they conceive of themselves sexually.  Social identities communicate shared experiences.
-Outside of church circles, the refusal to use the word “gay” to refer to those who are predominately attracted to their own sex is a refusal to speak English (J Finegan).
-“love the sinner, hate the sin” What you may be thinking of as “the sin” is what an LGBT person calls “a core part of who I am” or “my identity.”  So when LGBT people hear this phrase, they hear “God loves me, God hates me.” *Several of the gay people I talked to as I prepared for our discussion today mentioned this phrase specifically.
-“struggler” “gay lifestyle” “lifestyle choice” “sexual preference” All of these feel like blame is being placed on the LGBT person, or that one’s orientation is a choice. 
-“Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve” LGBT+ people will assume you’re ridiculing them in a “don’t you get it??” way; plus, it’s just tacky
-If in doubt, ASK.  Ask what terms or labels a person prefers.

Christian Response
Some DON’Ts
No biases
No agendas
Don’t ask the person to hide
Don’t out the person
Don’t suggest that “change is possible”





[Notes]
Pieter

Now that we know a bit more about language and how important our words are, let’s look quickly at some DOs and DON’Ts.  We’ll start with the DON’Ts.

-No biases – gay people are more than their attractions; engage them as a whole person
-No agendas – Jesus didn’t spend time with people to “get them saved”; he spent time with them to show them the Father’s heart toward them.
-Don’t ask the person to hide his or her sexual orientation
-Don’t out the person without permission
-Don’t suggest that the person can change their orientation or “pray away the gay” - studies show that orientation change, even among those who try, is extremely rare.  I don’t know anyone whose attractions have ever moved from gay to straight.




Christian Response
Some DON’Ts (continued)
Don’t imply that experiencing SSA is a choice
Don’t blame the “gay agenda”
Resist making sin comparisons
Let go of hang-ups
Avoid asking loaded questions





[Notes]
Pieter

-Don’t imply that a person is choosing to experience same-sex attraction - sexual orientation is very complex, but people don’t just wake up one day and decide to be attracted to people of the same sex
-Don’t blame the “gay agenda” for someone’s orientation
-Resist making sin comparisons; they just don’t work, and they’re often offensive.
-Let go of hang ups – “What if my friend is attracted to me?”  “What if they think I’m actually affirming?”  Just let go of those.
-Avoid asking loaded questions, especially about faith or theology



Christian Response
Some DOs
Cultivate relationship
Listen well
Be curious
Show affection
Strive to express acceptance
Secure a system of support





[Notes]
Pieter

And now for some DOs

-Cultivate relationship by being invitational - invite them to share a meal or coffee to be “with me”.  Josh, an out man who is not a Christian, said, “I think if a Christian invited me over for dinner and attempted to cultivate a friendship that would help me feel validated and heard.”
-Listen well – make eye contact, smile, genuinely listen.  
-Be curious – be sincere as you draw out their story in their own words.  One man who experiences same-sex attraction said, “Don’t pretend you have all the answers or understand what they’re going through.  Every story is different.”
-Show affection – as appropriate, offer physical and verbal affection
-We should strive to express acceptance, even while holding on to our beliefs: “I love you.  I will always love you. I am so thankful you told me. You are very brave. I am going to walk with you no matter what.  I really want to hear your whole story.” Parents can add “This is your home and we are your family – always!” (GF, p28)
-Tyler, an out man, said, “Extend belonging without expectation.  Help them thrive - they’re already battling so many other issues during such a tumultuous time.”
-Help your non-straight loved one secure a system of support. Parents, other family members, pastors, counselors, mentors, peers (depending on age, allow  but do not encourage peer support; immature peers sometimes gossip, tease, or reject). Teens and young adults who have strong systems of support have better long-term mental and emotional health outcomes.

Potential follow-up questions
Are you feeling or have you ever felt suicidal?
Are you being or have you ever been bullied or teased?
How have your friends responded to you?
How have people at church responded to you?

When someone comes out to us, even if we think we’re well-prepared, our minds can go into panic mode, “What do I say now???”  Here are some potential follow-up questions that are appropriate to ask.

About theology
Don’t lead with theology
Instead, let’s look at Jesus’s ministry…





[Notes]
Pieter

I want to wrap up this section with a brief word about theology
-We might be tempted to lead with theology.  But the moments after someone comes out to you is not the time for theological discussion.  Many of us fear we might be dishonoring God by not letting the person know up front what we think about same-sex sexual behavior.  We also fear that not leading with our theology might give someone the impression that we’re condoning, approving, or enabling same-sex sexual behavior.
-Instead, let’s look briefly at how Jesus did ministry to give us a sense of when theological conversation is helpful

Believe
Belong
Become




[Notes]
Pieter

There was a pattern or a sequencing, if you will, to Jesus’s ministry. He had good timing. He knew when to ask what questions.
Jesus operated within a Belong, Believe, Become framework during his ministry.
He first met people’s immediate needs and invited them into friendship to experience the love of God through His people.
Then, after they were convinced by the love of God that Jesus was worth following, He shared who He was and what that meant for their life.

When we look to Jesus’s example, we see that he went to Zacchaeus’s house, allowed a prostitute to touch him, went to the Roman centurion's house, touched people who had diseases and disabilities, all things that would have made him “unclean” in the eyes of many.  As he interacted with those people, He didn’t call out their sin first. Sometimes He didn’t call out their sin at all. Rather, he engaged them, befriended them, and called them to follow Him.

So how could that apply specifically to how we love LGBT+ people?
First, we can invite LGBT+ people to belong by offering unconditional love and a space to share their story without shame. 
Once they BELONG—once they’ve experience the love of God through you in an undeniable way and they want to get to know this Jesus guy,
Only then can we invite LGBT+ non-Christians in our lives to BELIEVE what the Bible and the Church teaches us about God’s love, including what that love means for their sexual stewardship
To do this, our churches need to offer a complex and winsome theology of sexuality, walking alongside people as they come to believe what is true and as they embrace how God calls people to steward their sexualities.
And then, only after they have found belonging in the Church and believe for themselves who Christ is and what that means for every part of their life
Only after that can we ask people to participate in the process of sanctification and become who Christ has called them to be
As we are all being sanctified and trying to become who Christ has called us to be

Here’s what Lindsey, who shared her story earlier, had to say about this topic:

We get so concerned that we are compromising something by not speaking truth about the Biblical sexual ethic. But here’s the thing...if the Holy Spirit is truly in a person, truth will arrive, it will just be a matter of time. The timeline will be different for everyone. And it is up to each person to decide whether or not to accept it. 
In my case, for at least the first year as I was stumbling out of suppression mode, I could not stomach the truth of the traditional Biblical sexual ethic. I wanted so badly to find a loophole. I yearned to follow my deepest longings and be in a relationship with a woman. It took me a long time to discern what to do with the tension I felt between my faith and sexuality. Through the process, my friends generally listened and loved me well. But sometimes, they lost patience in communicating grace, and launched Bible verses or advice at me when I just wasn’t ready for it. When someone spoke truth to me, I immediately shut down or lashed out. 
Grace could come through the front door, but truth had to sneak in through a window. 
Here’s what I’m trying to say - respect where each person is in their coming out journey. You’re not compromising truth by erring on the side of grace. You don’t have to endorse everything that they do, but just communicate that your presence and your love for them will not change, no matter what. By opening the door wide for grace, you one day may just see God sneak truth in through a window.

How does your sexual orientation intersect with your faith?
Are you planning to stay connected at church?




[Notes]
Pieter

So, when it IS appropriate to have a more theological conversation, here are some honoring questions you can ask about beliefs: 
What does your sexual orientation mean to you?
How do you describe your faith identity?
How does your sexual orientation intersect with your faith?
Are you planning to stay connected at church?

OK!  Now that you’ve got some pointers for responding compassionately, we’re going to practice.



PRACTICE


[Notes]
Amber

Before we do that, take a one-minute stretch break to loosen your muscles and think over some of the things we’ve talked about.  While you stretch, we’ll have some people handing out the stories you’ll be practicing with.  Be sure to get one of those.



Practice: Real Stories
What themes do you notice emerging from the beautiful stories of Lindsey, Jim, Josh, and Carl? The painful stories?
What were Lindsey, Jim, Josh, and Carl offered by Christians? by their families? by their friends?
Thinking about what you’ve learned today, how would you respond to Lindsey, Jim, Josh, or Carl?




[Notes]
Amber

Take a few moments to read over these coming out stories. 
When you’ve finished reading, discuss these questions with those around you:




PROBLEM


[Notes]
Pieter

The problem is, this is all reactionary.
What we’ve talked about today is how we can respond in a way that doesn’t add to the pain people are already experiencing.
Often, what we’ve been talking about here is loving LGBT+ people who are convinced Christians don’t love them and God has nothing good for them.

So while it is good to love LGBT+ people outside of the Church well
The real work is offering LGBT+ people something better inside Church
And offering that across the lifespan



A Church where…
Everyone is thinking theologically about their sexuality
Christians talk publicly about the challenges LGBT+ people face
Every kid knows God loves gay people
Pastors and lay leaders know how to minister to LGBT+ people
LGBT+ people could thrive in celibacy or Christian marriage





[Notes]
Pieter

What do we need to offer that’s better
Churches where everyone is thinking theologically about their sexual stewardship so that LGBT+ Christians find fellow cross-bearers in their straight brothers and sisters
Churches where we talk publicly about the cultural questions in the intersection of faith and sexuality so that everyone in our church knows how to reflect Christ to LGBT+ people and so that LGBT+ people know it’s safe to come out
Churches where every kid grows up hearing that if they are gay, God loves them, God has good plans for them, and they can share their story with their parents and pastors
Churches where pastors and lay leaders know how to minister to LGBT+ people well
Churches where LGBT+ people could actually thrive in celibacy or a mixed-orientation marriage

We can’t just tell LGBT+ people what they should say NO to
We have to offer something beautiful that they can eagerly shout YES to

Helping churches do that is exactly what EQUIP does year-round. We come alongside pastors and other church leaders to help them transform their churches into places where LGBT+ people could thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic. Once again, if you’ve volunteered with EQUIP or supported us financially, thank you for making this work possible
