What applications have you considered for your life? For AACF?

[Notes]
Last time we met, we sought to highlight all of the ways in which straight and LGBT+ people are the same
And that we can all meet our intimacy needs in spiritual friendship and are all called to inconvenient stewardship of our sexuality



WELCOME


[Notes]
Developing a posture for welcoming marginalized people




Orphans
Widows
Sojourners
The Bible
God
Marginalized People
Welcoming the Marginalized




Sojourner (n): a stranger, alien, or foreigner; “to dwell for a time”; “to live among people who are not blood relatives” 

Welcoming the Marginalized

[Notes]
left their land, often because of war or famine
rights restricted
at risk of being oppressed or taken advantage of
in need of protection
Perceived as a possible threat
Feared the Israelites




God’s solution: Hospitality
Reverent Worship + Compassion to Sojourners (Matthew 22)

Welcoming the Marginalized

[Notes]
welcome the sojourner, to invite him in, to treat the stranger as a guest
Matthew 22 to love God and love your neighbor as yourself
“The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God” (Leviticus 19:34)
warned not to neglect loving their neighbor for the sake of loving God




Sojourners = The People of God
The Israelites
Christians (Parable of the Good Samaritan)


Welcoming the Marginalized

[Notes]
Sojourners in plural form used to refer to Isrealites
God mourns that His people were created for perfect communion with God and each other and to work alongside each other without toil: they are sojourners in the world mired by sin 
Parable of the Good Samaritan
Christ is asked “Who is my neighbor?”
Samaritan is the neighbor, we are the man left half dead
Christ first saved us




We can empathize with the sojourner because we have been sojourners, and the Church ought to welcome the sojourner just as Jesus welcomed us

Welcoming the Marginalized
25

[Notes]
Christ followers have all been sojourners and they are all still sojourners



Share
In what ways have you been a sojourner, stranger, different, on the outside, alone, oppressed, in need of protection, etc.?

LGBT+ People are Sojourners

At risk of being mistreated
Verbally and physically abuse

Welcoming the Marginalized

How might seeing LGBT+ people as sojourners impact your posture toward them?

[Notes]
Hospitality, grace, patience
Instead of seeing them as disobedient, sexually indulgent



LOVE


[Notes]
Principles and skills for ministry
 
Suggestions for walking with LGBT+ friends who are not Christians and are open to spiritual conversation:




A non-Christian LGBT+ person’s salvation is more important than his or her sexuality

Loving LGBT+ Seekers




Choose to be sensitive to the stories and experiences of LGBT+ people
Don’t tokenize
Appreciate their unique experiences
Practice term mirroring

Loving LGBT+ Seekers




Do your part—no more, no less.
Recognize the sins of the Church
Trust the Holy Spirit

“If I do not condemn, I am condoning”
Where does that come from?
Are you comfortable resisting condemning and trusting the Holy Spirit?



52




Having “the conversation” well.
“Why do you need to know?”
“What would it communicate to you if I agreed with you? If I disagreed with you?”


Loving LGBT+ Seekers




Sometimes we unintentionally communicate that we might not be emotionally safe

Loving LGBT+ Seekers

[Notes]
Presumptive language about gender, sexuality, and marriage in our speech or social media posts can be perceived as microaggressions toward LGBT+ people. We can be intentional about identifying and removing these phrases from public speech.




Learning always requires failure
Ask questions and listen

Loving LGBT+ Seekers



ENGAGE


[Notes]
Engaging Side A Gay Christians




We can be respectful and share the truth at the same time

Engaging Side A Gay Christians




Be prepared to discuss the “why” questions
Why does God say that homosexual activity is a sin?

Engaging Side A Gay Christians

Share
Why does God say that homosexual activity is a sin? What’s your answer?



64

[Notes]
Only blesses life-long Christian heterosexual marriage for the purpose of raising children and enjoying intimacy (reflection of complementarity in the trinity and Christ/the Church)
Others are connections that God doesn’t sustain and will therefore bring great pain
Infidelity, addiction, suicide within community – oppression or bad fruit?





Have a conversation about why you each believe what you believe
Is it honoring to God?
Is it harmful to self or others?
Is it habit forming?
Is it helpful to self or others?
