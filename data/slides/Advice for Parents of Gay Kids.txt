Lifesaving Advice for Parents of Gay Kids
Pieter Valk, LPC of

[Notes]
Tyler, thanks again for the introduction
I’m looking forward to sharing with you today
This conversation about caring for gay kids better matter a lot to me
Because I’m gay, I’m a Christian, and I’m convinced that God’s best for all Christians is either vocational singleness or opposite-sex Christian marriage
Lifesaving Advice for Parents of Gay Kids

[Notes]
ive been told that parenting is difficult



[Notes]
apparently it’s not the same as having a dog
Points I am learning: raising a kid is not like raising a succulent
I’m seeing some nods in the audience to i think thats confirmation

Sound familiar?
Didn’t have a chance to teach about sexual stewardship for all

Didn’t know how to talk about God’s wisdom and love for gay people

Christians were silent at best, homophobic at worst

[Notes]
ive witnessed that raising kids is beautiful and painful
particularly in my work as a Licensed Professional Counselor and as the director of EQUIP
I’ve met with a lot of parents of teens who recently came out
these parents love their kids
and the parents, the kids—everyone is in pain

a lot of you tuning in are parents of teenagers who recently shared with you that they are gay
and you’re trying to figure out how to do your best with what you’ve got

but it’s tough
a lot of the parents I’ve met with probably have similar stories to a lot of you
before your teen shared, you probably didnt have a chance to teach your children to think carefully about their God-honoring sexual stewardship for all people
you didnt sit in on conferences like these, so you didn’t know how to talk specifically about LGBT+ topics in compassionate and theologically accurate ways with your kids across the lifespan
over the decade before your teen shared, you and your churches were probably silent at best and homophobic at worst
Sound familiar?
Gay teen waited 5 years to tell you

Pastors ill-equipped to support your family

Therapists and parachurch ministries made your teen feel strange

[Notes]
then your teen shared and for most of you, you realized that your gay kid had waited 5 years to come out to you
if you reached out to pastors at your church for help, they were probably just as ill-equipped to support your child and your famly
if you sent your child to a therapist or parachurch ministry, they might have made things even worse, even if they knew what they were doing, because your kid felt like a strange hospital patient who needed specialized care
Sound familiar?
Your teen didn’t know any gay Christians thriving according to God’s wisdom

Your teen didn’t see any straight people thriving in lifetime singleness

[Notes]
your child probably didn’t know of any gay Christians thriving according to God’s wisdom in your church to give them hope
your kid probably didn’t see many straight people thriving in lifetime celibacy, so it was difficult to imagine that that would be good for him
Sound familiar?
You argued about whether it was a phase

You argued about whether your teen could come out to their friends

You argued about whether they could call themselves gay or queer

[Notes]
you might have argued about whether it was a phase
or argued about whether they could come out to their friends
you might have gotten bogged down in arguments about whether they could call themselves gay or queer
Sound familiar?
Your teen shared that they adopted a progressive sexual ethic or weren’t a Christian at all anymore

You had to figure out whether to allow your gay teen to date or not

Your teen learned poor theology online, connected through dating apps, and found echo chambers of peers

[Notes]
many of you had tough conversations when your teens shared that they had adopted a progressive sexual ethic or weren’t a Christian at all anymore

you found yourself having to navigate same-sex dating.
do you let you teen date people of the same sex, as long as they don’t have sex?
do you have, seemingly, a different standard for your gay children than your straight children, and not allow them to date at all?

all the while, your teens have been steeped in bad theology through their phone,
connecting with gay people through dating apps,
and airing your families dirty laundry in an echo chamber of similarly-minded peers
You’re starting from behind in a race to
save your kid

Now what?

[Notes]
in a few words, you’re starting from behind and feel like you’re in a race to save your kid
WHAT DO YOU DO?
Lifesaving Advice for
Parents of Gay Kids
Mourn and believe it’s not your fault

Pray for a miracle

Do what you can

Change your church for the next generations

[Notes]
I want to offer 4 suggestions:
mourn that you are behind and its not your fault
pray for a miracle
do what you can
change your church for the next generation
Mourn + it’s not your fault
It’s not your fault that your kid is gay

It’s not your fault that you’re starting from behind
Your parents and pastors should have prepared you, but they didn’t

You did the best you could with what you had, but it still wasn’t enough

[Notes]
mourn that you are behind and its not your fault
if there’s two things i really want parents in these circumstances to hear, its this:
this is painful, and it’s not your fault
this is a difficult as you say it is
you are not exaggerating

and it’s not your fault
its not your fault on 2 levels
first, its not your fault that your kid is gay
there is no scientific evidence for the theories that bad relationships with parents leads to people developing same-sex attraction
my hunch is, regardless of how good of a parent you were, your kids were going to one day realize they are gay

second, it’s not your fault that you’re starting from behind
it’s not fair to blame yourself for starting from behind
your pastor didn’t sit you down when your first kid was 5 years old and prepare you to say and do what you needed to for your teen to share earlier and with different results
your parents didn’t have these conversations with you
no one handed you a book when your kid was 5 to teach you
\
your parents or your pastors should have prepared you for this
but they didn’t
and to be clear, they should have
but they didnt

my hunch is, you did the best with what you had
you’d probably be the first to admit that that wasn’t good enough
but i want you to hear from me, a gay Christian who was hurt by my parents’ imperfect responses, that I now recognize that they did the best with what they had,
even if it hurt

i know that if my parents could go back and learn earlier, initiate conversation earlier, respond better,
my parents would in a heartbeat
i know they love me
i bet the same is true of you
and i hope one day you get to hear the same things from your child
Mourn + it’s not your fault
Feel the pain and connect with a spouse, close friend, or parent group

Don’t be surprised by avoidance, anger, or numbness

Don’t be surprised by new pain

Don’t mourn in front of your teen

[Notes]
yet you’re still starting from behind and feel like you’re in a race to save your kid
there is a lot of pain that can’t be undone
the enemy has been conspiring carefully and cleverly for a long time
it is as bad as you think it is
you’re not over-reacting
this is not the way its supposed to be
it hurts

so feel it

talk to your spouse or a close friend
find other parents of gay teens

dont be surprised if at times you want to avoid the reality, or you are angry, or you just feel numb
those are normal

dont be surprised if, as you learn more and appreciate the pain of your child and this conspiracy of sin against your family, that each step of deeper understanding brings a new wave of pain

and last, and very importantly, please do not mourn in front of your teen
they are hurting enough
and if they see you mourning, that might just add to their feelings of shame
its easy for a teen to see you hurting and think, “I did this. They’re hurting because I’m gay. It’s my fault.”
so protect your child from that by mourning privately with a spouse or close friend or support group
Pray for a miracle
For most, it will take a miracle or hitting rock bottom

So, pray that the Holy Spirit would connect with your kid in an undeniable way

But prepare for the likelihood that no miracle will come…

[Notes]
Second, pray for a miracle
when i meet with parents of gay teens or young adults who are 5 years behind,
their teen or young adult has often walked away from the faith (or seems on that path) because of the pain they’ve experience around faith and sexuality
These parents often ask me, “how can i save my kid.”

I often respond with something like this:
I wish I could reassure you with a list of guaranteed steps for making all of this right, but I cant
my consistent experience with parents in your circumstances is that its going to take a miraculous movement of the Holy Spirit
or your kid hitting a painful rock bottom, for things to change
and I hate that
I really wish I could promise you something different
but I cant
and no parent wants to wish a painful, rock-bottom experience for their kid

so let’s pray for a miracle
recognizing that you are starting from behind and feel like you’re in a race to save your kid
pray that the Holy Spirit, in His infinite power, would overwhelm the barriers and entrenchments in your child’s heart established by years of pain and lie after lie from the Enemy
pray that God would speak to your child in an undeniable way and comfort them that God is real, He loves your child, and God is worth following,
even when it seems painful and unfair
pray for a miracle

and at the same time, I want to encourage you to hold this hope for a miracle in a healthy way
recognize, that much more often than not, miracles don’t happen
I dont know why, but God usually doesnt work through miracles
I say this because I fear for your spiritual health if your belief in God and God’s love for you becomes dependent on whether He provides this miracle
and believe me, gay people know this danger well. many of us tied our belief in God’s love to God miraculously removing our same-sex attractions. and when it didn’t happen, it was devastating

so beg for a miracle
but its probably best for your spiritual health and your child’s if you prepare for no miracle
which brings us to our third point...
Do what you can
Expect your child to give you little grace because they’re hurting

Your kid probably knows more than you, at least for now

Get educated quickly

Don’t fight over language;    mirror terms instead


[Notes]
do what you can
There’s 8 of these

First, expect your child to give you little grace because they are hurting
ive shared that its not your fault that you’re behind
that no one taught you what you needed to know
that you probably did the best with what you had
and it probably still wasn’t enough
and it hurt your child
and it will probably be a long time until your kid can recognize all of this and give you grace

so in the near future, don’t expect any
expect your child to lash out in their pain, and probably hurt you
and please, choose to endure it without reciprocating
choose to imitate your savior by taking on punishment for sins you did not commit, as an act of love
second, realize that your kid probably knows more than you, at least for now
on average teens wait 5 years after realizing they are gay to tell a parent
and believe me, they’ve spent those 5 years pondering and reading and researching and arguing in their head and with people on the internet
they know their stuff
and remember, you’re starting from behind
so don’t pick fights, because you will probably lose
it’ll be like arguing with a Mormon about Scripture
their arguments will be too well rehearsed. they are practiced
so accept that your kids probably know more than you, at least for now
third, in the meantime, get educated, quick
it’s time to catch up
one thing it’d be good to learn early, for example, is to focus on the present,
instead of getting bogged down in the past, trying to figure our how and why your kid is gay.
to be honest, there’s no answer to that question. the consensus of scientists is that it’s some combination of nature and nurture factors,
but we have no idea what those nurture factors were.

there are so many great resources out there
many of the authors I would suggest them have already spoken or will speak this weekend

Rachel Gilson
I'd humbly submit my work and the work of EQUIP. Our blog is full of high-quality, free resources, including a recent 8-part series for parents
fourth way you can do what you can: dont fight over language
without getting to deep into this discussion,
Arguments about what words Christians should use to describe themselves can be an early barrier to the important conversations.
what really matters is whether your teen knows Jesus,
whether Jesus is your teen’s Lord and Savior,
whether your teen is willing to follow God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship.

Don’t let argument about language get in the way of those more important conversations.
So instead of getting stuck in identity language conversations, practice term mirroring.
Ask teens what words they use to describe themselves and what those words mean to them.
Then choose to use their words with there definitions as an act of hospitality.
This doesn’t mean you are agreeing with their definitions or identifications.
It just means you’re not letting identity language conversations be a barrier.
Do what you can
Confess the idolatry of romance and the hypocrisy in the Church
We lead teens to believe that romance is the most beautiful thing God created
We tell gay teens they don’t need it
Few straight people are seriously considering lifetime singleness
Churches resist gay marriage but ignore teachings on celibacy, procreation, and divorce


[Notes]
fifth, confess the idolatry of romance and hypocrisy of the church
the more you learn about the intersection of faith and sexuality, the more you’ll see that American’s worship romance
and Christians haven’t done much to resist that idolatry
we’ve just tried to baptize it
we’ve come to believe that romantic connection is the most beautiful thing God created, and we can’t imagine a full life without it
not only is this inconsistent with Scripture, but we lose all credibility when we turn to gay teens and tell them they don’t need romantic connection to be whole people,
after we’ve spent a decade letting straight teens believe the opposite

thats when you’ll see the hypocrisy
no straight people are seriously considering a life without romance for the sake of the kingdom
so why would you be surprised when your gay teen isn’t interested in considering that either
then while conservative churches tow the line on gay marriage
they ignore what the bible has to say about divorce and procreation and celibacy

confess these
admit to your teen that Christians have a problem
and the way churches currently are, its just plain unfair
Do what you can
Focus on your teen knowing Jesus

Teach and model a better sexual stewardship for all
God created all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family
God designed two best ways for us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family: Christian marriage and vocational singleness

[Notes]
Sixth, focus on your teen knowing Jesus
even if you have to make sacrifices
for some, this might look like attending a side a church for awhile so that your teens can connect with God in a shame-free way
at the heart of it, your kid just wants to be like any other kid: to be loved by parents, God, friends, and people they are attracted to just as they are
but that doesn’t mean you should change your theological beliefs
sit in that tension of continuing to believe God’s wisdom while temporarily attending a church where your teen can hold on to their faith as you catch up

Seventh, teach and model a better sexual stewardship for all
here’s a 6-point, broad outline for sexual stewardship for all people
before you jump into arguments with your teen about gay marriage and gay romance
you need to lay a good foundation

1. God created all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family
2. God designed two best ways for us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family: Christian marriage and vocational singleness
Do what you can
Teach and model a better sexual stewardship for all
One day you will get to ask God whether He wants you to seek vocational singleness or Christian marriage
But unfortunately, humanity’s sin has bent and broken the goodness of everything God created, including how all of us do intimacy and family

[Notes]

4. But unfortunately, humanity’s sin has bent and broken the goodness of everything God created, including how all of us do intimacy and family
Do what you can
Teach and model a better sexual stewardship for all
Here are some ways sexuality is broken…Ways others’ sexual brokenness may affect you: adultery, abortion, divorce, infertility, widowing, pornography, sexual abuse…Ways brokenness in your own body may burden you: same-sex attraction, gender dysphoria

[Notes]
5. Here are some specific ways sexuality is broken.
The brokenness of the sexuality of others may negatively impact your life (these are listed in no particular order and vary in severity):
One of your family members might have an affair, get an abortion, get divorced, struggle with infertility, or be widowed.
A family member or friend might look at inappropriate images and accidentally or intentionally expose you to those images.
Someone might touch you in inappropriate ways.
A family member or friend might make inappropriate jokes around you.
Alternatively, you may discover there is some kind of brokenness in your own body that you did not choose and that burdens you:
You might realize that you’re attracted to people of the same sex in the ways most of your friends are attracted to people of the opposite sex.
Or you might start to feel like your inner sense of being a boy or a girl doesn’t match your body.
Do what you can
Teach and model a better sexual stewardship for all
“If you realize broken sexuality is impacting you in any of these ways, I want you to know that it’s not your fault. I hope you will share with me quickly if one of these is a part of your story. I’ll listen, I’ll comfort you, and I’ll do whatever I can to make it right.”

[Notes]
6. If you realize broken sexuality is impacting you in any of these ways,
I want you to know that it’s not your fault.
I hope you will share with me quickly if one of these is a part of your story.
I’ll listen, I’ll comfort you, and I’ll do whatever I can to make it right.
Do what you can
Clear boundaries for devices and dating
Provide the same device accountability for gay and straight teens
Should any Christian teens date?
Is casual teen dating theologically connected to Christian marriage?
Might forbidding gay teens from dating but allowing straight teens to date cause more harm?
Be the parent, protect your teen

[Notes]
Eighth and finally, do what you can by providing clear boundaries for devices and dating
ive sat through conversations with many parents getting into the nitty-gritty
do i put filters and accountability software on my gay teen’s devices?
do i block downloading apps?
do i allow them to have snapchat, instagram, tiktok, etc?
do i demand access to review those at any time?
do i allow them to date? what does dating mean? what can they do? not do?
particularly while they still live in your house

first, be consistent
when it comes to devices, if you’re doing those things with your straight children, then do them with your gay teen
but if you’re not checking your straight child’s instagram messages, then dont check your gay teen’s messages
if you don’t have a filter on your straight child’s devices, then dont put a filter on your gay teens’ devices

when it comes to dating, it gets trickier.
without getting into a long conversation about Christian dating, i think Christians at large need to have a conversation about whether casual Christian dating is that wise.
Is it really good for our faiths to date and make out with people we have no real possibility of marrying?
does the revolving door of connecting in deeply emotional and physical ways with another person only to break up 6 months later really prepare us to be faithful to our spouse?
or are they preparing us for divorce?
so maybe no Christian teen should be dating
but your straight Christian teens are probably going to keep dating

so let me ask you this
does teenagers dating really have anything to do with opposite-sex Christian marriage?
is it really theologically connected to that in any way?
can you really say that straight Christian teenage dating is in any meaningful way an on-ramp to a Christian marriage for a vast majority of teens?
if not, then what does the prohibition against gay marriage have to do with dating practices?
if Christian teen dating isn’t really connected to Christian marriage, then what relevance does restrictions on Christian marriage have to do with Christian teen dating?
if your straight teens can date and that dating has nothing to do with our theology of Christian marriage, then why can’t gay teens date?

to be clear, I do not think same-sex romance or dating is a good thing for your gay teen
but I don’t think straight teens should really be dating either
but my goal here is not to convince you what to believe about casual Christian dating
it’s to point out the inconsistency
i wonder whether forbidding gay teens from dating but allowing straight teens to date hurts gay teens more than just allowing everyone to date

but second, be a parent
you’re not going to make friends when it comes to accountability
but thats why you’re a parent and your kids are kids
they are not developmentally capable of resisting many of the addictive features of their devices and of casual romantic and sexual connection
they need you to make tough decisions that they won’t like but that will protect them from pain that cannot be undone
Change for the next generation
You can change the stories of other families
Teach young parents what you wish you had known
Lead support groups for parents of gay teens
Urge pastors to get training
Pressure churches to become places where gay teens can thrive

[Notes]
Fourth, change your church for the next generation
this one is painful and important
you are starting from behind
a miracle is unlikely
you’ve got a lot to learn
and unfortunately for many parents i’ve met with, they get to a point where their teen has grown up and their influence has diminished
their opportunities to have an impact are less
they haven’t given up on their children
but they are accepting how powerless they have become to change their children

yet, many have chosen to use their story and their hard-earned wisdom and expertise to make a difference
maybe they can’t go back in time and change their family’s story
but they can get involved in their local churches and change the stories of other families

they can teach young parents what they wish they had known
they can give back in support groups for parents who have just learned their kid is gay
they can urge their pastors to get the training they need to prepare parents
they can pressure their churches to take practical steps to become a place where the next generation of gay teens thrive according to God’s wisdom

for many of these parents, this doesn’t change their family’s story
but it feels like it honors it
it makes meaning out of the pain
and there’s great comfort in that


Churches where gay teens thrive
Children grow up seeing gay Christians thriving according to God’s teachings

While kids are young, parents are trained to teach a vision of sexual stewardship for all people in age-appropriate ways (6-point outline from earlier)

When teens realize they are gay, they share with parents quickly


[Notes]
but what does it look like to be a church where gay kids and parents of gay kids get what they need?
I want to end by painting that picture in 6 ways

First, in an ideal world, your children would have grown up seeing gay Christians thriving in their churches according to a traditional sexual ethic and giving your children hope that if that were their story, their story would be good too

Second, before a parent’s oldest kid is 5 years old, children’s pastors would train every parent to talk well about sexual stewardship for all people
and demonstrate that they are a safe space where gay kids can share if that’s their story
children’s pastors would educate parents to teach kids that 6-point outline of sexual stewardship for all people I shared earlier

then, when some kids started realizing that they re gay, they would remember that God loves them and has wisdom for their lives as gay Christians
and they would remember that their parents are safe and want their kids to share with them
ideally, those kids would share about their sexuality with parents only a couple of weeks or months after recognizing it themselves
Churches where gay teens thrive
Gay teens embrace the beauty and the burden of God’s wisdom

Gay teens experience deep relationship with God, parents, and friends

Gay teens discern vocational singleness or Christian marriage and respond to God’s call


[Notes]
Fourth, because of the healthy theological foundation and the encouraging testimonies already provided to them,
gay teens would embrace the beauty and the burden of God’s wisdom

Fifth, without fear or shame before God, toward themselves, or with friends and family,
gay teens would experience deepened relationships with God, their parents, and with their friends

And last, just like any other teen and young adult, they’d eventually start discerning whether God is calling them to vocational singleness for the sake of the kingdom or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex
and they’d step into whichever vocation God has called them to because they’ve seen both modeled in their church, valued in their church, and supported in their church

all of this would lead to gay kids faithfully loving and serving their family, fleeing from temptation, and thriving in God’s vocation for them.

Help your church become a place where gay teens thrive according to God’s teachings

[Notes]
if you want to help your local church become that kind of place,
id love to connect over email or the phone to strategize together
email me at pieter@equipyourcommunity.org, and we’ll find a time
that’s pieter@equipyourcommunity.org

so, if you’re a parent of a gay teen who has come out to you in the past few years
if you feel like you’re starting from behind and feel like you’re in a race to save your kid

mourn that you are behind and its not your fault
pray for a miracle
do what you can
change your church for the next generation

I pray God gives you comfort in mourning, perseverance in prayer, wisdom in your care for your teen, and courage to help your church become better.
Amen
Amen!
