Our Mission
To equip the Church with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction




[Notes]
need: gay teen suicide, hate crime, feel unwelcome

challenge: pastors and parents don’t know how to minister or teach
because they don’t have the understanding or skills

solution: equip with understanding and skills
partner with churches to provide training from top down
to minister, teach, and support
according to a traditional sexual ethic: celibacy or MOM




Our Vision
We want the Church we leave our children to be one where boys and girls grow up hearing their parents, friends, and pastors talk about sexuality in compassionate and meaningful ways. And if those boys and girls find themselves attracted to other boys or girls of the same sex, we want them to be able to share with their parents, friends, or pastors without fear or shame.




[Notes]
why do we do this? why does this vision matter to me?
My story: experiencing same-sex attraction and reconciling that with traditional Christian beliefs that God calls all people to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
I felt that alone, afraid, shame, dirty in middle school when I started to realize my attractions
Prayed daily that God would fix me, make me normal, make me straight
I didn’t have parents or a church around me where I thought it was safe
All I knew was God was against homosexuality
Got to college and took the risk of fully known and fully loved
shared my story and starting doing life with other people
finally let myself be angry with God (particularly over assumption that I am necessarily called to celibacy because I am gay)
Met with a therapist just wanting to find peace and meaning in life
biggest take-away was that it is good and normal that I need relationship with other men and I shouldn’t be afraid of that
leaned into friendship with others
any open to a relationship with a woman
 As I made sense of my story and did life with others who experience same-sex attraction, realized my parents and church didn’t know how to speak to my experience or minister to me because they were never taught
 And their silence on this topic was out of fear of saying the wrong thing and a lack of confidence
That’s why EQUIP does what it does: so that the Church can have that understanding and skills and confidence to put them into practice

POSTURE


[Notes]
I assume that you have basic pastoral care skills
This training is meant to supplement that with SSA-specific ideas and skills
We don’t expect every pastor, lay leader, and parent in your church to be able to effectively minister
Different people will have different depth of expertise





Choose to be sensitive to the stories and experiences of LGBT+ people
Don’t tokenize
Appreciate their unique experiences
Practice term mirroring

Posture




Demonstrate safety and empathy
Invite to share, and listen
Trust the Holy Spirit


Posture




Avoid forced-choice moments
Invite to submit to traditional sexual ethic
Patiently explore God’s call to sexual stewardship

Posture

[Notes]
Right now, our churches aren’t offering something better, so if you push them into a corner and make them choose, they will not choose Jesus
This has been difficult with my own side A gay Christians friends—their depression and suicidality
That patience is key—it may take decades or longer of walking through these ideas for the Holy Spirit to move the person where he/she needs to be




Turn & Talk
Many find it difficult to maintain an environment of sensitivity, safety, empathy, and patience because of messages like, “If I do not condemn, I am condoning.”
Where does that come from?
Are you comfortable resisting condemnation and trusting the Holy Spirit?




[Notes]
SL

Threatened by and angry about changes in society (despite Facebook wall, your nephew is not the gay agenda)
	Defense against insecurity in own beliefs
	Jesus ate with tax collectors and sinners




MINISTER


[Notes]
11 questions
creating space for questions, helping think well, and listening well 
don’t expect you to answer questions for them



Ministering: Core Q’s



Will you treat me differently now that you know?
Honesty
Honor courage in sharing

[Notes]
Terrifying when I first shared my story



Ministering: Core Q’s



How does same-sex attraction develop?
None of us are how God made us to be
Neither born gay nor chose to be gay

[Notes]
corrupted at genetic level and raised in broken world
Twins and hormone studies inconclusive, suggestion predisposition
Not genetically determined
Not chosen




Ministering: Core Q’s



How does same-sex attraction develop?
Understanding developmental factors may help an individual gain acceptance but should not be addressed with the goal of “fixing” the individual

[Notes]
For me this was helpful because it wasn’t a mystery anymore.
My experience also breaks the duality—it doesn’t fit in the culture war




Ministering: Core Q’s



Will my same-sex attraction change?
There is no promise of change in attractions
Some will experience change and some will not, but not as a reflection of how hard we want it or work at it

[Notes]
I have experienced a decrease in frequency and magnitude of my same-sex attractions
But still a daily challenge, I expect it always will be
I’ve moved on from asking God to change this, and that has been really healthy for me
False hope in my life was very destructive for a long time




Turn & Talk
How have you responded when students have come out?

How does being neither born gay nor choosing to be gay change the conversation?

Ministering: Core Q’s



What part did God play and why?
Does God make people gay?
Give people over to “a depraved mind”?
Allow people to develop same-sex attraction?
Play no part?



Ministering: Core Q’s



What part did God play and why?
Did not intend for anyone to be gay or make anyone gay (James 1:13) 
We are all corrupted at a genetic level and grow up in a broken world (Psalms 51:5) 
God allowed it to happen        (Romans 5:12)



Ministering: Core Q’s



What part did God play and why?
If God protected us from the consequences of our actions and the actions of others, would we really have choice?
God seeks to redeem all brokenness for our good and His glory (Romans 8:28) 

[Notes]
Question of Evil
No good answer



Ministering: Core Q’s



How does God see me?
He’s not surprised, and He sees you as valuable (Psalms 139)
We are all broken and accepted before a gracious and merciful God who will never abandon us



Ministering: Core Q’s



Where is God in all of this?
Be honest with God—He can take it (Genesis 32:22-32)
Frame within God’s universal intentions of intimacy and sexuality (Genesis 2)

[Notes]
I was really angry with God but suppressed that angers for a decade
Finally, I had a mentor who encouraged me to be honest
Jacob wrestling God—it is intimate
I had to express that anger before I could believe that God loves me—and honestly, I am still working through that




Ministering: Core Q’s



Who am I in light of what I am feeling?
Name and affirm experience while encouraging delayed identification
Distinguish between attractions, orientation, identity, and behavior
Radical acceptance: acknowledge and commit to work through

[Notes]
I am a child of God, first and foremost
And I accept that same-sex attraction is a part of my story
And it has significantly impacted my journey and how I see the world
What do I do with that? How do I label that?

For me, it has been helpful to identify as a gay Christian
Shared heritage
Similar life experiences
Unique perspective in the Body of Christ
Still secondary and operated by my identity in Christ
In Heaven, with bind some but divide none




Turn & Talk
Which of these questions would you feel most comfortable helping someone think through? Least comfortable?

What part did God play and why—how are SSA students likely to react to this?




[Notes]
SL






What do I do with all of this shame?
Satan’s primary weapon
Our response:
Identify, Reject, & Replace
Share
Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
When we tell people to hide their attractions
Not to talk about them
Don’t allow them to identify around them in any way
When we blame people for reaching out for forbidden things from their loneliness
We heap on the shame







 How do I refrain from behavior?
Pray for strength
Eliminate opportunities
Accountability
Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
Important distinction here about sexual addiction
Many gay Christians I know suffer from sexual addiction
Not because SSA is the result of sexual addiction itself
But because pornography, masturbation, and acting out with others was the solution we found to medicate the shame and loneliness we felt from being a Christian and experiencing same-sex attraction
This developed into an addiction that we will have to manage for the rest of our lives
But not all gay Christians struggle with sexual addiction
And there are plenty of straight Christians who struggle with sexual addiction

That’s all to say, if someone struggle with sexual addiction (gay or straight), accountability and managing temptation is going to look different and I encourage you to connect them with recovery programs specifically for sex addicts






 How do I meet my intimacy needs?
What are my needs?
Normalize
Jesus: angels in the wilderness and disciples in Gethsemane
Stewardship of meeting in healthy ways

Ministering: Core Q’s






 How do I meet my intimacy needs?
Same-sex attractions are unmet needs for healthy same-sex intimacy that have been sexualized
Seek healthy relationships with safe friends

Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
Encourage healthy relationships with others

My life got better when I stopped ignoring my loneliness and started meeting my needs in healthy ways with deep friendship
And to this day, if I am struggling with lust, instead of shaming myself, I want my first response to be asking myself whether I have been meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways (which I haven’t)







 What does the future look like?
A lifetime of sanctification and sexual stewardship
Intimacy with God and His family and working to redeem the world
Obedience to God’s teachings and surrendering our brokenness to God will bring goodness (Jeremiah 7:23)
Ministering: Core Q’s






 What does the future look like?
God invites everyone to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Both are equally good and available to those who experience same-sex attraction
Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
A lot of my depression came from this feeling that my future would only contain continued suffering. 
As a child, I was led to believe that a wife and kids are what would make me most happy. And society tells me that if I only had a relationship with a guy I am attracted to, I would be most happy.
But my attractions and beliefs make none of those an option
So you can see how it would be easy to despair
It wasn’t until I rejected those “promises” as false and learned what God really offers that I saw that my life can be just as beautiful as anyone else’s (if the Church does a better job of supporting celibates and MOMs)




Turn & Talk
Leaning into healthy intimacy with same-sex friends seems counterintuitive. What are some ways your community has encouraged healthy intimacy?
How could you use discussion around these questions to disciple an SSA student?
