ABOUT PIETER
Historic Sexual Ethic
A belief that God’s best for every Christian is either vocational singleness (a lifetime vocation of abstinent singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention) or Christian marriage (a lifetime vocation of opposite-sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom)
my story

[Notes]
I want to share how I think God is inviting me to steward my sexuality in life-giving ways
How those of you who are gay can thrive according to God’s wisdom
And how those of you who are straight can better love your gay brothers
 
But it’s been a journey to get to where I am today

Before college I was ashamed of being gay AND afraid others would find out and treat me poorly because of that
Between the ages of 13 and 23, I prayed 1000s of prayers,
went to 100+ hours of counseling with a therapist who thought he could change my sexual orientation,
and spent 9 months with a pray-the-gay away ministry
But I’m still gay

I also felt alone because I didn’t think there was anyone else like me.
I grew up being taught by TV and the culture around me a horrible stereotype of gay people:
that they all went to group sex parties, that they all had AIDS, that they were all addicted to drugs, and that none of them wanted anything to do with God.
Based on that image, I didn’t think I belonged with gay people.
But on the other side, all of the Christians I knew were straight (or so I thought), and I was led to believe that in order to be a good Christian, you had to be straight.
And then there was me, stuck in the no-man's-land in the middle. I didn’t belong anywhere.
I was alone.

But out of this loneliness a desire to be known and loved grew.

Sharing this part of my story in college was a mixed bag
Throughout college, I devoted myself to a campus ministry.
I followed every instruction of my mentor, led Bible studies, represented the organization to the university, and planned recruitment efforts.
I was given every reason to believe I could join the campus ministry staff after college if I desired.
And then without warning, I was told not to apply to go on staff with that campus or at any university.
The only explanation given: we don’t know what to do with you and your attractions.

Thankfully, most responded to my story with love and compassion. During my sophomore year a gay brother in the Christian fraternity I was a part of was confronted about having sex with his boyfriend and left our fraternity
I took the scary step of sharing my story with the entire fraternity.
I needed straight brothers to know how to better love people like me, and I needed brothers who were gay to know that they weren’t alone. After I shared, my fear of being shunned turned to joyful surprise as brother after brother lined up to give me a hug and opened their phone to schedule a meal to get to know me better.
These men embodied Christ for me better than any church ever has.
 
After sharing with my fraternity, a number of guys who were gay and had similar beliefs as me shared with me about their story
We started making sense of life together
I realized that all of us were afraid that following Jesus' teachings meant that we would be alone
And none of us had parents or pastors who knew what to do with us—who knew how to help us
By my senior year in college, although I had gotten into medical school, I couldn’t shake the feeling that God instead wanted me to go into full-time ministry helping churches better love gay people like me
so I got my Master’s in counseling so that I could provide better one-on-one pastoral care to people like me
I started EQUIP in 2014 with the mission of equipping parents and pastors to better serve gay people according to a traditional sexual ethic
And I started the Nashville Family of Brothers in 2018 to offer celibate men like me lifelong, lived-in family

WHAT DO I BELIEVE
Being gay is a result of the Fall. God did not intend for me to be gay.
Being gay is a brokenness, but it is not a sin.
God does not send people to hell merely for being gay.

[Notes]
So what do I believe?

well first, I believe that experiencing same-sex attraction,
people finding other people of the same sex physically attractive and desiring romantic relationships with them,
being gay,
is a result of the Fall
That when Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, their sin led to a domino effect of brokenness.
Their sin bent all of the ways God had perfectly designed and ordered this world.
To the extent that this world around us, the people around us, and even ourselves are not how God first imagined us.
None of us are how God intended
All of us, regardless of sexual orientation, are corrupted at a genetic level, developed imperfectly in our mother’s womb, and were born into a broken world that wounded us long before we ever gained the capacity to sin
So I don’t think that when God first imagined me and projected me being born into a perfect world, that God planned for me to experience same-sex attraction
But because I was born into a broken world, one of the ways I was affected by that brokenness is that I gained these attractions
 
But I want to be clear that being gay, experiencing same-sex attraction, is not a sin
It is a brokenness, a temptation to sin,
but God doesn’t hold against anyone their involuntary thoughts
God does not send people to hell merely because boys are attracted to boys or girls are attracted to girls


5
WHAT DO I BELIEVE
Attractions, orientation, identity, and behavior are different
We do not choose who we are attracted to, but we choose how we respond.

[Notes]
Fourth, Let me also point out at this point that there’s a big difference between attractions, orientation, identity, and behaviors
And when Christians on either extreme conflates these, it causes big problems
Same-sex attractions can be nothing more than infrequent or one-time recognition that someone of the same-sex is physically or sexually attractive
A same-sex sexual orientation is a consistent pattern of same-sex attractions
Same-sex sexual identity involves identifying as gay either by name and/or by participating in gay culture in ways that can be small like putting a rainbow sticker on one’s car
Same-sex sexual behavior consists of romantic and sexual activity
What I want you to see is that a Christian can experience infrequent same-sex attractions but not have a same-sex sexual orientation
A Christian can have a same-sex sexual orientation, but choose not to identify as gay
A same-sex attracted Christian can identify as gay but choose not to engage in same-sex romantic and sexual activity
But the extremes in the conversation want to deny that that nuance is possible
Those on the Left argue that all of these must line up in a particular direction, or the person is practicing self-hate
And people on the Right argue that in order to faithfully refrain from gay sex, a person must also find a way to eliminate their same-sex attractions or at least pretend they don’t experience them anymore

Fifth, I don’t believe people choose who they are attracted to, choose to be gay or straight,
But we do choose how we respond

6
WHAT DO I BELIEVE
A mix of nature and nurture contribute to the development of sexual orientation
There is no proven formula for changes a persons’ attractions
God calls all Christians to vocational singleness or Christian marriage

[Notes]
Sixth, The consensus of scientists is that people develop their sexual attractions through a mix of nature and nurture, but people do not choose who they are attracted to
There is also no formula for changing a person’s attractions: no proven combination of prayer or counseling or weekend retreats to change someone’s sexual orientation
Certainly God has the power to do miracles,
And sometimes he does!
but scientific studies show that 96% of people who seek sexual orientation change efforts experience no change in their sexual orientation, but they do experience a 92% increase in suicidality due to sexual orientation change efforts (nearly doubling suicide attempts)

Now at this point, many people reasonably ask:
If same-sex attractions are broken, God didn’t intend for anyone to be gay, yet God allowed that brokenness to develop and rarely heals that brokenness when people ask God for healing, how is that fair?
At the core of that question is the timeless question: why do bad things happen to innocent people?
Right?
Because people don’t choose their sexual orientation, and gay people haven’t done anything to bring about their sexual orientation
They’re innocent
So why?
Well, in order for us to have real choice and true agency to choose to love God and other people, God has to let the consequences of our decisions play out
It’s the theological concept of free process
If God just swooped in and protected each of us from the consequences of the sins of others, would their choices have been real choice?
No
So in order for our love for God and each other to mean something, God chooses the greater good of allowing things to play out
How does that apply to broken sexuality?
I believe that gay people developed this brokenness because of the sins of others
Brokenness in their genes passed on through generations
Sin in the different environments I grew up in
And to protect free will, God chose not to swoop in and prevent me from developing SSAs by blocking the consequences of the decisions of others

Thankfully, God has promised us (and I’ve absolutely seen it to be true in my life) that He is faithful to redeem our brokenness for His glory and our good
It’s been particularly through submitting my brokenness to God and faithfully stewarding my enduring brokenness that I’ve experienced the most beauty and community and meaning in my life

What does the Bible have to say about all of this?

Well, as I understand it, and as a majority of Christians have understood the Bible for 2,000 years, God calls all Christians to traditional sexual ethic
a belief that God’s best for every Christian is either what I call vocational singleness
(which is a lifetime vocation of abstinent singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention)
or Christian marriage
(which Christians have historically understood to be a lifetime vocation of opposite-sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom)

7
WHAT DO I BELIEVE
There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses
Same-sex sexual and romantic activity are sins in any context

[Notes]
There’s also no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses in Scripture
Even without investigating the so-called clobber passages that Christians have historically understood to prohibit same-sex sexual activity
We can conclude from what God has clearly said about what His best is for us (vocational singleness or Christian marriage)
And the absence of affirmation of same-sex sexual activity in any context
That same-sex sexual and romantic activity are sins in any context

Okay, so that’s what I believe
What I hope you notice is that I’m staking out a moderate, middle-way position here
I’m rejecting a progressive sexual ethic that abandons historic biblical wisdom to one extreme
And I’m rejecting pray-the-gay-away theology that’s caused 1000s of suicides on the other extreme
Instead, I’m holding on to both compassion and conviction

For me, while I’m not bisexual, I’m not generally attracted to women
I have been in a couple of dating relationships with women where I was transparent about my sexuality and grew a desire for them specifically
so I knew that if God wanted me to get married to a women, that could work
but more important than what I want, I started asking God in 2014 what He wanted for me.
Would He rather I get married or commit to vocational singleness?
And around 2017 I felt strongly that God was calling me to vocational singleness.

But no one can live life alone. So in 2018 some friends and I started building the Nashville Family of Brothers
A place where I could find lifelong, lived-in family with others called to vocational singleness
why?

[Notes]
now you might be wondering: this understanding is terribly inconvenient for me
how am I convinced that this is how God sees it?
most people start with the six passages in Scripture that many claim directly calls gay sex a sin
They are often called “the clobber passages”

I’m not going to get into those.
I think they are meaningful evidence,
but there’s also reasonable ways some people cast doubt on how convincing those 6 passages are

No, for me, what is truly convincing is not these few passages, but the whole of Scripture
consistently, Scripture reveals God’s design for our lives
God’s order for the world, even in the midst of brokenness
When it comes to what to do with our capacity for romance and sex, God seems to be pretty clear
there are two options for all Christians: vocational singleness or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Jesus and Paul had a lot to say about both of those
they praised both and described both as having a specific design
WHY DO I BELIEVE?
Vocational Singleness: give up romance to do kingdom work parents can’t (Matt 19, 1 Cor 7)
Christian marriage: lifelong partnership between a Christian man and women to enjoy intimacy and raise children (Matt 19, Eph 5)
or

[Notes]
In Matthew 19 and 1 Corinthians 7, they spoke of a committed singleness
where one gives up romance and marriage and sex
to do kingdom work parents have a hard time finding the time and energy to carry out

And in Matthew 19 and Ephesians 5, Jesus and Paul spoke of Christian marriage
as a lifelong partnership between a Christian man and woman
for the purposes of enjoying intimacy with each other, raising children, and embodying the gospel

you see, the Christian should not approach God or the Bible with the question, “What is permissible, when it comes to my sexuality?
What can I get away with?”
instead, we should ask, “What is most wise and most good?
What is God’s best when it comes to my sexuality?”

God’s best for how all Christians should steward their sexuality is clear:
vocational singleness or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex
I’m not interested in settling for anything less than God’s best


10
WHY DO I BELIEVE?
But, I can’t ignore the bad fruit of a progressive sexual ethic

My gay Christians friends who adopted a progressive sexual ethic lost their faith

[Notes]
But beyond theology, there are compelling reasons to follow God’s wisdom as we understand it
You see, even if I could somehow convince myself theologically that God would bless a same-sex marriage between two Christians
I can’t ignore the bad fruit of a progressive sexual ethic in my life and the lives of others

Primarily, most of my gay Christian friends who adopted a progressive sexual ethic stopped believing in God
at first, they did a little bit of theological acrobats to say that maybe Scripture could be read to support same-sex marriages
but after awhile they admitted that the Bible probably says what we’ve thought it has said
So they continue believing that God fully blesses same-sex marriages,
but they just concluded that the Bible is not binding or authoritative for modern people
but once they get to a place where the Bible and the Church can’t tell you who God is
they realize they are just worshipping a God they came up with
and what’s the likelihood that the God of their imagination is real?

and listen, I don’t want that for my gay friends
I want all of them to have robust relationships with God
but the fruit I see of a progressive sexual ethic is my gay friends losing their faith

I’m convinced both by theology and by experience that a traditional sexual ethic is what’s best for me!

11
WHY DO I BELIEVE?
Gay Christians following Biblical teaching experience bad fruit too.

The Church MUST do better.

[Notes]
But there’s bad fruit of a traditional sexual ethic
my gay Christian friends who are stewarding their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic are lonely, struggle with sin, and this effects their relationship with God and the Kingdom work they could do
And this is because the Church is doing a horrible job teaching about sexual stewardship and loving and serving people like me
I think that’s the double burden of gay Christians:
the Church doesn’t know how to love us well,
and the alternatives culture offers still aren’t good for us either

that sucks
yet, that doesn’t make something bad for me good for me
that doesn’t change something from being a sin to edifying to God

why is this the way God made things?
you know, I don’t know
but at the end of the day, it’s not my job to question God or tell Him how to do His job
I’ve just got to trust that God knows what is best for me and obey His teachings

I don’t think the solution to the bad fruit we see is to abandon a traditional sexual ethic because there’s even worse fruit of a progressive sexual ethic.
No, the solution is for Christian communities to do a better job teaching what the Bible has to say
and embodying it in ways that leads to thriving in the lives of gay Christians following a traditional sexual ethic









solution

[Notes]
no, I think the solution is for churches to learn how to better embody a biblical sexual ethic in a way that produces good fruit for gay people
SOLUTION FOR GOOD
Become churches where…
Everyone is thinking theologically about their sexuality
Christians talk publicly about the challenges LGBT+ people face
Every kid knows God loves gay people
Pastors and lay leaders know how to minister to LGBT+ people
LGBT+ people could thrive in vocational singleness or Christian marriage

[Notes]
We’ve got to start inviting every Christian to think theologically about their sexual stewardship
and to take seriously what the Bible has to say about vocational singleness for straight people, God’s purposes for marriage, and unbiblical divorce and remarriage
 
We’ve got to make sure everyone in our churches know about God’s love and wisdom for gay people,
and in particular kids so that they never have to make sense of their sexuality alone in the closet
 
We have to become churches where every Christian considers vocational singleness and could find permanent, lived-in family in lifetime singleness
 
I think if we do these things, our churches can become a places that offer gay people something undeniably better than the empty promises of the world
We can be a place where gay Christians find more beauty and connection from following God’s teachings than from seeking out romantic relationships with people of the same sex
questions?
6 tips

[Notes]
So I’ve shared with you my story and how I understand God thinks about these questions
I want to wrap up with some practical advice for everybody.
First I want to speak to the straight people in the room.
I’ve got three suggestions.

16
STRAIGHT PEOPLE: TIPS
Do your homework
Take your sexual stewardship seriously
Give God a chance to call you to vocational singleness too

[Notes]
First, do your homework
we all need to know how to speak into these topics in theologically accurate and compassionate ways
whether its a conversation with friends or with family members, how you speak about this matters—your words can either point people to the love and Lordship of Jesus, or it can become a barrier to gay people knowing God or enable painful choices
But I want to encourage you not to make your gay friends be your teacher
Instead, I want to encourage you to do your own homework
I’ll send a reading list to yall through Mark
please don’t default, out of laziness, to holding a traditional sexual ethic in an way that lacks compassion
but also, please don’t default, out of laziness and a fear of being perceived as mean, to a progressive sexual ethic
because when straight people in my church hold a progressive sexual ethic, it makes it more difficult for me to hold a traditional sexual ethic
When I’m having doubts about my convictions, I need my straight brothers and sisters to hold me up
But instead, if my straight brothers and sisters are just adding to my doubts, they make it easier for me to capitulate to an ethic that may be harmless for straight people to hold but has drug many of my gay friends into unbelief
 
Second, take your sexual stewardship seriously
over the past few decades most churches have continued to teach that God would never bless a gay marriage
but they’ve relaxed their teachings on casual dating, child-rearing, and divorce and remarriage for straight people
gay people take note of this discriminatory application of scripture
we look for an explanation of why, and the only thing we can come up with is homophobia
and this victim mentality makes it very difficult for us to continue holding ourselves to God’s high standard of sexual stewardship
and accepting accountability from others to that high standard
when straight people are called to a lower standard
so help out by holding yourself to a high, biblical standard of sexual stewardship
ask yourself tough questions about whether casual dating is a misuse of pleasure
take seriously the consistent teachings of Scripture and the Church that Christian marriage is a space for sacrificially raising children, among other things
and take seriously the consistent teachings of Scripture and the Church that there are also no grounds for Christian divorce and remarriage
even when it’s inconvenient
because God’s good teachings are really inconvenient for gay people like me, but we still follow them
 
Okay, and third (and kind of related to the previous one)
give God a chance to call you to vocational singleness too
take seriously what the bible has to say about the lifetime vocation of abstinent singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention
really consider that singleness of Jesus and Paul
the Scripture say that God wants to call some of you to that
would you pause to listen?
would you open-handedly receive whichever gift God says is better for you?
even if it’s not the one you prefer?
that helps gay people, because currently gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic are some of the only people committing to lifetime vocational singleness
so because of our small numbers, churches can ignore the call to teach out our vocation in scripture or take practical steps to offer us lifelong, lived-in family in our churches
but if 10% of straight Christians accepted God’s call to lifetime vocational singleness, pastors would finally listen to the voices of celibate people, teach us, and support us
so discern

17
GAY PEOPLE: TIPS
Follow Jesus, no matter the cost
Seek out family
Integrate your sexuality, instead of serving it or shaming it

[Notes]
And last but not least, I want to talk to the gay people in the room.
I’ve got three suggestions for yall. These are less prescriptive, and more just take-away’s from my own journey.
 
First, I want to encourage you to follow Jesus, no matter the apparent cost
I know its hard and unfair, but following God’s teachings are better than the alternative
I’ve shared already about my personal experiences and the consistent experiences of gay people around me
I guess I just hope you can learn from my mistakes
I know the feeling of trying to steward your sexualities according to a biblical sexual ethic and feeling lonely and perhaps even depressed and crying out to God, “this couldn’t possibly be your best for me”
and yet, for the gay Christian, in order to submit your life fully to God
and find the most richness and beauty in this life, I’ve seen that we have to accept some hard things
We see that it is unfair and unjust
We see that it will probably continue to be that way
We see that we could reasonably use that to justify doing what we want
But we are convinced that God knows better for us than the wisdom of the age
We are convinced that following Jesus will be worth the cost
We are convinced that picking up our crosses will be better
No matter how painful, no matter how much suffering
Because it is in following Christ’s example by taking on suffering for a purpose that we will find ourselves and find the God whom we were created to be in relationship with
You might ask: what’s the point of my suffering?
Well, I can’t say for every gay Christian
for me, it’s helped me see the pain of people of color and immigrants and poor people and the mentally ill so much better
I want to fight for them
and it helps me fight for other gay people
in ways that I could never if I were straight or if I had not accepted the suffering
I have fully accepted that I cannot undo the pain I have experienced
and things might not change in churches fast enough for me to experience something meaningfully better
but if I can spend my life—suffer—so that the next generation of gay teens experiences something radically better than I did
that’s worth it
100 time that’s worth it
I would choose this life over and over again
So please, follow Jesus, no matter the apparent cost, because I’m convinced it will be worth it
 
Second, seek out family
just as I said earlier, we were all created for intimacy with God and other humans
we need that in spiritual, emotional, and physical ways
none of us can make it through this life alone, and that is no less true of gay people
Please don’t be afraid or ashamed of asking others in this community to be family for you
ask them to be a part of their lives
you could even try to start an intentional Christian community with single and married folk
Whatever you do, find family
And I’ll add one little piece of advice that I’ve found helpful: I’ve seen that if I want to be a part of my married friends’ lives, particularly once they’ve had children, I’ve got to be willing to inconvenience myself. To be a part of their family on their terms, because despite the challenges of singleness, raising children is a different kind of hardship than I will probably ever know
 
Third, I want to encourage you to find a way to integrate your sexuality, instead of serving it or shaming it
It’s probably obvious why I would discourage the gay Christian from letting their sexuality dictate the priorities in their life, and I’ll note that straight Christians do this just as often, just perhaps in ways that we’ve become blinded to. There’s an idolatry of romance among straight Christians combined with an acceptance of no-fault divorce and remarriage that straight Christians should find much more troubling than rainbow flags and unicorns.
So I’ll speak to the other: integrating your sexuality instead of being ashamed of it
for a long time I tried to pretend like I was just like every straight person
that there wasn’t anything different about my story or more difficult about the prospects before me
but that just minimized my pain and gave me no space to mourn the injustice in this world
it also nurtured homophobia in my own heart
I first started integrating my sexuality by sharing about it—by sharing my story
this helped remove a lot of shame and helped me identify in helpful ways with how I am different and how God has redeemed that for my good and His glory
then as I started recognizing that my story was different and there were ways I felt more connected to gay people than to straight people, and I gave myself permission to experience that affinity
for me, that looked like calling myself gay, seeing myself as connected to the gay civil rights movement, seeing myself connected to the hate crimes against gay people, and giving myself permission to enjoy gay artists and cultural elements
again, Christ is still the only person that sits on the throne of my life
and everything I do is submitted to His wisdom
and at the same time, there are beautiful aspects of gay culture as a minority culture born out of oppression that are healthy for me to connect with, strengthen my faith, and help me better empathize with others
