LGBT+ STUDENT

CARE TEAM

[Notes]
Thanks for the opportunity to dive into this conversation with all of you






What’s your role?



When (1) students reach directly out to you for support or (2) other teachers connect you with students:

Provide long term care and support according to God’s love and wisdom

[Notes]
Either when students reach directly out to you for support
Or when other teachers pass on students to you
You’re available to provide long term care and support according to God’s love and wisdom



What’s your role?



Important: if the student shows any signs of being at risk of self-harm, pass the student on to DECE immediately.

If you’re unsure, ask Academy leadership.



What’s your role?



Confidentiality
Be clear early in meetings that you will not lie to parents if they ask
And that you must pass the student on to DECE if they share about self-harm risk



What’s your role?



In general:
Listen to their stories
Assess their needs
Address any urgent risks
Be a patient and trust the Holy Spirit

[Notes]
listen to their story
Ask them questions
Be curious
Assume you don’t know their story, and be a learner
Give them space to make sense of their story
While highlighting God’s wisdom

assess their needs
Take note of areas of growth in their emotional and spiritual health
Also be aware of their strengths and resources
Provide ongoing care based on their needs

Address any urgent risks
If they’re in any immediate danger physically, mentally, socially

And then be patient
And trust the Holy Spirit
And be a consistent presence in their life
God’s wisdom will seem inconvenient and unfair to most students
Give them time and space to process



What’s your role?



Reasonable expectations:
You don’t have to be an expert in everything
Lean on your strengths
Ask for help from others

[Notes]

I’ll send you a list of videos, articles, and books for you to deepen your expertise



STATS


[Notes]
Before we get into some theological resources, I first was to explore common mental health needs students might have
Unfortunately, LGBT+ students are know to be at a higher risk of multiple mental illnesses
While we should never assume an LGBT+ student is struggling with mental illness merely because they are LGBT+
We should be prepared to support them around those challenges

I want to be clear: if a student is dealing with severe levels of any of these, pass them on to DECE
And if they are showing any signs of being at risk of self-harm, pass them on to DECE
At a minimum, your awareness of the prevalence of these among LGBT+ students will give you better eyes to spot the challenges, address what’s appropriate for you to address, and pass on to DECE when appropriate



Mental Health Stats



Compared to their straight peers, LGBT+ students are…
4X more likely to attempt suicide
2.5X more likely to struggle with anxiety or depression
2X more likely to deal with body shame (gay males)

General Tools



Encourage authenticity with self, God, and others
Redirect from sexual ethics to core questions of faith
Help student accept brokenness
Guide students to conceptualize sexuality
Identify healthy coping mechanisms

[Notes]
Encourage authenticity / integration / honest with self, God, those we love
Often our distress comes from disintegration
From dishonesty with self, God, or others
From incongruency between what we feel and think and believe
Generally encourage students to integrate all of these parts of their life and be honest with themselves, God, and closet family and friends

Lower the stakes by redirecting from emotionally-loaded questions/convos about sexual ethics and romance/marriage to less loaded convos about 3 big questions

Help students accept that we live in a broken world
Some amount of brokenness is unavoidable
It’s not their fault
And it’s not generally God’s plan to fix all of it on this side of heaven
Yet God doesn’t leave us there
He promises to redeem our enduring brokenness for our good and His glory
Ask Him how?!
Know that God isn’t surprised
He loves you deeply, even as a broken person
Important to distinguish between brokenness vs sin

Offer 3 lenses as way for students to conceptualize complex reality
Integrity
Disability
Diversity
What these each mean
Why understanding ourselves by looking through all three lenses simultaneously is most effective
But probably most helpful to lean on disability lense

Moderate with health coping mechanisms (music, bible verses, walk, etc.)
Who can you talk to?
Breathing/mindfulness (apps)
Music
Video Game
Certain Bible verses
Images/photos/memories that encourage
Go on a walk, play music
Craft/art
Journal



Mental Health Risk



Anxiety
Sexual Addiction
Depression
Suicidality
Shame
Sexual Assault
Body Shame

[Notes]
In light of that, I want to offer you a quick survey of 7 common mental health challenges among LGBT+ students
Explore the sources of those struggles
And offer suggestions for interventions

Anxiety
Sexual Addiction
Depression
Suicidality
Shame
Sexual Assault\
Body Shame



Anxiety



Rumination/preoccupation with fear that becomes out-size and debilitating. You can support by helping students:
Reduce the power by naming
Challenge them to right-size the fear
Accept that some amount of fear is unavoidable in a broken world

[Notes]
Isolation in the closet often leads to anxiety

Rumination/preoccupation with fear that becomes out-size and debilitating.

You can support by helping students:
Reduce the power of fears by specifically naming/writing down what they are afraid of being true/happening
Challenge them about how likely that size/severity of outcome is and right-size the fear
Accept that some amount of fear is unavoidable in a broken world and ”ride it out”




Sexual Addiction



Using porn, masturbating, or having sex more frequently than they’d like to without the ability to reduce/stop
Reduce access with filters, blocks, and accountability
Meet intimacy needs in healthy ways and connect with painful emotions

[Notes]
If a student it using pornography, masturbating, or engaging in sex with others
More frequently than they would like to
And they are unable to reduce/stop
Then they may have an addictive relationship with sex

I want to be clear: LGBT+ does not automatically mean sex addict
But, for many students who have felt the need to hide their sexuality and experience anxiety and depression from that hiding
Porn offers escape/numbing from painful emotions
And a false sense of connecting with others they are secretly drawn to
So LGBT+ students are particularly vulnerable to developing addictive habits with pornography

So what do you do?
Reduce Access and Meet the Real Need
Reduce access by taking practical steps to make it more difficult to see pornography or use dating apps
Filters on devices
Accountability reports to parents

And meet the real need
What sexual addiction covers up are painful emotions we don’t want to connect with
And loneliness
So teach students to notice their emotions and honor them
That painful emotions are unavoidable, but if we postpone them, they just get worse
And encourage them to meet their needs for connection in healthy ways
But emphasize that being lonely doesn’t necessarily mean to need romance or sex
It just means we need people in our life who we can be honest with and will be honest with us
People who we know their story and they know ours
People who feel safe and who we can spend time with
So help them identify people he could be that kind of friend for them
And encourage them to cultivate that friendship



Depression



Loss of purpose/relationship where grieving is delayed, turning to despair/hopelessness
Identify the loss
Create time/space to mourn
Normalize lingering grief
Identify reasons to hope

[Notes]
Depression comes from losing either purpose or a relationship
But having a hard time connecting with/processing/mourning that loss
Or wanting to avoid the pain of feeling that sadness
But then that delayed grief spoils into despair and hopelessness
Depression comes from an inability to properly grieve

The solution, then is to identify the loss that needs to be grieved
create time/space to grieve
To normalize lingering grief
And to identify reasons to hope

In particular, LGBT+ students may anticipate that their sexuality means
Either honoring God and parents by going without romantic love
Or choosing romantic love and disappointing God and parents
Being in the closet can amplify that: with every week and month of hiding, there’s a sense of loss of self

Encourage them to be honest about their sexuality with themselves, God, and close family and friends
And remind them that even if they choose to follow a traditional sexual ethic, that isn’t a call to loneliness
Those called to singleness for Jesus can still find robust family among biological family and friends and church
And some may end up marrying someone of the opposite sex with enduring SSAs



Suicidality



Sometimes non-fatal self-harm to numb painful emotions or get attention. Other times it’s life-threatening
Help students self-harming in non-fatal ways connect with painful emotions and use healthier coping
If life-threatening, assess the risk, address the depression, and encourage students to alert

[Notes]
Suicidality
Sometimes suicidality is non-fatal self-harm
Meant to number painful emotions
Or get attention
Other times, it’s a threat to take one’s life

If non-fatal self-harm,
Help student connect with and feel through painful emotions
Healthy coping mechanisms

If life-threatening,
Assess risk: plan, means/method, taking any steps to prepare (giving away stuff, writing note, etc.)
Address depression
Ask student to reach out if ever seriously contemplating



Suicidality



"On measures of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as well-being, our sample is doing better than expected. Most were in the normal range for depression, anxiety, and stress and on another measure of distress, most again scored in the normal range. On a measure of well-being, most of our sample score high on overall life satisfaction" (Costly Obedience, Mark Yarhouse, pg 218)

[Notes]
does trad sex ethic cause suicide? No
SOCEs causes suicide
Side A leads to loss of faith
But Side B leads to strong faith and positive mental health outcomes
"On measures of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as well-being, our sample is doing better than expected.

Shame
“I am a bad thing”, belief that one is incapable of good, image of God lost
Distinguish between shame and guilt
Identify shame messages
Reject shame messages
Replace with who we are in Christ

[Notes]
Distinguish between shame and guilt
Guilt is “I did a bad thing”
Shame is “I am a bad thing”
Those struggling with shame think they are incapable of good (not perfect, good)
They ignore that reality that we were all first made in the image of God, and while that is broken and imperfect, it is not entirely lost

This is one of Satan’s primary weapons against those in the closet
He tells students lies about how God sees them and about their family or friends would treat them if they knew

You can respond by distinguishing between shame and guilt
helping them identify shame messages
Reject them
And replace them with true statements we find in scripture about who we are in God’s eyes as his children






Body Shame
Gay males are 2X more likely to struggle with the lie that if they looked perfect, they would be loved
Expose the lie of body shame
Mourn unmet needs
Take practical steps to meet intimacy needs in healthy ways

[Notes]
A specific form of shame common among straight women
But twice as common among gay male teens
Leading to eating disorders
Body shame tells them some version of the following lie:
“If you looked like the perfect-looking guys in pornography, you'd be loved. You wouldn't feel alone. You're lonely because you don't look like the guys in videos. It's your fault. You have no one to blame but yourself.”
But no matter how perfect people look, it won’t satisfy body shame
Because the real need isn’t to be handsome or beautiful? Or even desired? It's to not be alone.
It's to be connected in healthy ways and believe we are enough.

We can help students by exposing the lie
Name it and reduce its power

mourning our unmet needs
recognize what we really need—where there's truly a painful lack and mourn it
We're made for lifelong, lived-in family with other believers but for a variety of reasons, many of us don't have that
hold the pain of loneliness and doubting your worthiness of love before God and each other, and give yourself time and space to feel

and taking practical steps to meet your intimacy needs in healthy ways
We’re already talked about encouraging healthy friendship



Sexual Assault



Greater risk among closeted LGBT+ people because fear of being outed keeps them from reporting or getting help
Name (unfortunately) how common
Reassure them it’s not their fault
Be clear about confidentiality
Invite them to share
Address related mental illness

[Notes]
While not technically a mental health diagnosis
There are higher rates of sexual assault and lack of consent among LGBT+ people
Particularly if they are closeted
Because the fear of being outed keeps them from seeking out resources
Or reporting abuse

If you suspect student might have been a victim of abuse or assault
You can name how unfortunately common it is
Reassure them that it’s not their fault
Also be clear about confidentiality
And invite them to share

Them address anxiety, shame, depression, etc. that may step from abuse/assault
