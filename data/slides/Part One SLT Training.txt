Natural Law
Homosexuality is Unnatural
No examples in nature
Anal sex unnatural
Physical and mental health risks

[Notes]
Asserting dominance and ambiguous sex, but no analog to Modern Family

anal bleeding
Excretion
lose control of bowel movements
Risk: colon cancer

Prevalence: HIV infection
alcohol and substance abuse
Suicide

I don’t assert these to argue that homosexuality necessarily causes these things
oppression and discrimination are often causes
which leads us to a broader question


Natural Law
What makes a sin sinful?
Arbitrary lines? No
Fun things? No
That which will hurt us

Broader Theological Themes

[Notes]
historical area or weakness
Broader Themes
Created for perfect intimacy with God and His family
Intimacy needs normal and good
Neither marriage nor sex promised or necessary to meet needs

[Notes]
must meet in healthy ways or will meet in unhealthy ways
God creates Eve, Jesus when tempted and in garden, in Heaven

don’t know how to meet needs outside of
Broader Themes
The Blessing of Singleness (really)
Every person is first called to singleness
Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges

[Notes]
benefits of singleness
and regardless of whether marriage later, all people should learn to do this well first
disadvantages of marriage?
Broader Themes
The Uniqueness of Christian Marriage
One man and one woman before God
Reflection of intimacy and complementarity in trinity
Centrality of procreation
Responsibility and commitment

[Notes]
called out of singleness into marriage
vocation to raise children for kingdom
asking SSA persons to steward sexuality (likely singleness) wouldn’t be so outlandish if we were already asking OSA Christians to do the same (first commit themselves to singleness and only some enter marriage if called and with proper understanding of responsibility-A JOB and commitment-NO DIVORCE)

Lie that people need and are promised marriage
Singling out gays while ignoring divorce/adultery
Church culture of silence and fear of subject
Nearly impossible to live out singleness
Spiritual friendship nonexistent

Accurate theology about marriage
Nondiscriminatory application of Scripture
Shame-free church to talk about experience
Robust culture of singleness
Spiritual friendship to meet intimacy needs
Complex understanding of gender
