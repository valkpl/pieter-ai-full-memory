CELIBACY


[Notes]
JP has filled me in on where yall have been the last couple of weeks
you’ve talked about God’s intentions for sex, marriage, and divorce
today I want to invite you to consider the other half of the coin
as adult Christians, marriage is not the only normative option for stewarding our sexuality in God-honoring ways and flourishing
that other option is celibacy



Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of abstinent singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to lifelong marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Others called to celibacy and intimate family in the Body of Christ

[Notes]
To talk about celibacy, I first want to share briefly how it fits into God’s larger narrative for sexual stewardship

I want to be transparent about where these ideas come from
Are they grounded in Scripture? YES
Is there anything in here contrary to Scripture? NO
But if we use Scripture, alone, there are gaps
Luckily, God endowed the institution of the Church here on earth with the authority to fill in those gaps
So some of this also comes from what the Church has offered as orthodoxy for the past 2000 years and what is affirmed by the vast majority of Christians throughout time and even today globally



Created for Love



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19:3-12, Mark 10:2-12, Gen 1:26-27)
Intimate (1 Cor 6:16)
Procreative (Gen 1:28)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)

[Notes]
The love God enjoys in the Trinity and in covenants with His people can be described by 5 factors:
diverse/complementary (Matt 19:3-12, Mark 10:2-12, Gen 1:26-27)
intimate (1 Cor 6:16)?
procreative (Gen 1:28)
faithful/covenant (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
sacrificial/generous (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)



Created for Love



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

Sexuality – our need for relationship, to know and be known, to give and receive that kind of love

[Notes]
Because we are created in God’s image, we are made for that kind of love with God and each other
we are all made for diverse, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment and sacrifice
our sexuality is our need for those things
our need to be in relationship
to know and be known
to give and receive love
and because we are mind, body, and spirit, we need connection on cognitive, physical, and spiritual levels



Created for Love



We are all created for family in the Body of Christ (Genesis 2, Leviticus 26:12) 

Family –a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other

Neither sex nor marriage is promised or necessary to meet our intimacy needs

[Notes]
we are all created to enjoy this within the context of family in the Body of Christ, but where and how we find that may look different depending on whether we are called to celibacy or marriage
the family = a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other
all called to chastity: to only participate in relationships and activities that honor God
neither sex nor marriage are promised or necessary to meeting our intimacy needs



Created for Love



None of us can meet our intimacy needs fully or finally in this lifetime (Isaiah 59:2)

If we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, our flesh will reach out for destructive and unsatisfying alternatives (1 Corinthians 7:1-40)

[Notes]
But sins separate us from God and man and none of us can meet our intimacy needs fully and finally in this lifetime (Isaiah 59:2)
In addition, if we do not meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, our flesh will reach out for destructive and unsatisfying alternatives (1 Corinthians 7:1-40).

Did you grow up hearing your church/parents promise (directly or indirectly) that you would be married and need to be married to be whole? 

Did your church/parents teach that we could be satisfied in our relationships with God and our spouse if we did them correctly?

Our first calling



A period of abstinent singleness
Enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ
Called to neither lifelong celibacy nor marriage
Submit our sexuality to God, study the Scriptures, discern with God and others

[Notes]
What are we called to? How do we meet our intimacy needs?

We are all first called to a period of abstinent singleness in which we enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ in non-sexual, non-romantic companionship.
We should all learn to do this well
This is a calling to neither celibacy nor marriage—defining our default calling in the negative is not sufficient but it is informative—we are not yet called to celibacy or to marriage. 
We should not assume that we are called to marriage just because we have sexual desires, want to be a parent, or find abstinent singleness to be too challenging. 
We should all submit our sexuality to God, study what the Scriptures have to say about sexual stewardship, and discern with God and spiritual mentors in our lives whether we are called to celibacy or marriage.

Are you comfortable assuming that you are called to neither marriage nor celibacy?

What if we have strong sexual desires, want to be a parent, and find abstinent singleness to be too challenging?

What’s the Bible say…



…about celibacy and marriage?
Matthew 19:8-12
Better to be celibate if cannot accept what Christian marriage is
We do not choose celibacy or marriage, we are called

[Notes]
We must start by engaging Scripture.
What does God have to say about singleness, celibacy, and marriage?
How should I steward my sexuality, regardless of my desires or convenient cultural messages found in and out of churches?

In Matthew 19:8-12, Jesus calls married people to a deeper level of commitment to each other. 
He recognizes that for those who cannot make this level of commitment, it would be better for them not to marry. 
Some have been called to marriage, others have not. 
To illustrate this point, Jesus compares our experience to that of a eunuch—a person who refrains from sex and is not married. 
He notes that some are this way because of how they are born (this could refer to the sexual or gender minority that does not feel he or she should marry); that some are made eunuchs by others (referring to genital mutilation, enslavement, and any other involuntary process); and that others choose this lifestyle (choose lifelong celibacy). 
Importantly, Jesus recognizes that celibacy is not always chosen and that some who are called to celibacy are called involuntarily.



What’s the Bible say…



…about celibacy and marriage?
1 Corinthians 1: 7-8, 32-25
Preference for celibacy
Marriage will be a gift to those who are called to it

[Notes]
In 1 Corinthians 1: 7 and 8, Paul recommends that Christians refrain from sex and not marry. 
He communicates a preference for celibacy and a desire that all would be celibate, but he recognizes that all are not called to celibacy. 
Paul recognizes that for those who are called to marriage, that will be a gift as well. 
Continuing in verses 32 through 35, he advocates for celibacy because the concern of the celibate is not divided between God and one’s spouse and children.

The New Testament strongly encourages celibacy and recognizes that celibacy is given, not chosen—some will find themselves called to celibacy despite their personal preference.
The New Testament allows for marriage for those who are called to it, recognizing that marriages provides a vision of Christ’s relationship with the Church that ministers to both those who are married and those who are celibate.
Nevertheless, the Bible recognizes that marriage is difficult and should be entered into cautiously. 
Ultimately, the Bible comes up just short of calling all people to celibacy, but it also reprimands the person who assumes he or she will be married.

From your study, does the Bible strongly encourage (if not prefer) celibacy and state that we do not choose celibacy or marriage but are instead called? If so, what are the implications of that?

Called to Marriage



Lifetime vocation between a man and a woman to enjoy intimacy, raise children for the Body of Christ, and embody the gospel for each other and the world

[Notes]
Let’s talk about these two vocations practically
For those who are called to marriage, they should recognize that marriage will be one of the most difficult things they do
Christian marriage (a marriage blessed and sustained by God) is a lifetime commitment between a man and a woman to enjoy intimacy with each other and raise children
to embody the gospel for each other and the world
to reflect the Trinity and God relationship with the Church
complementarity of the genders/sexes both psychologically and biologically
intimate - sexually, emotionally, and spiritually
procreative - raise children
faithful - lifetime
sacrificial - in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer

those called to marriage will thrive when they seek to fulfill these purposes
Churches must teach accurately about what marriage is and support families to keep their vows and raise children



Called to Marriage



How does marriage embody the gospel?
Complementary of the genders/sexes both psychologically and biologically reflect the Trinity and Christ’s relationship with the Church
Intimate – sexually, emotionally, and spiritually

The “complementary” and “procreative” elements have (only) recently been challenged inside and outside of the Church. How essential are they? What is the impact of dismissing these elements?






Called to Celibacy



Celibacy is NOT a call to loneliness for the sake of the gospel

Celibacy IS a call to diverse, intimate, and spiritually procreative relationships that are maintained by commitment and sacrifice

[Notes]
celibacy is NOT a call to loneliness for the sake of the Gospel
celibacy is still a call to diverse, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment and sacrifice



Called to Celibacy



Unique benefits:
Deeper friendship
Greater possibility for spiritual parenthood, church leadership, and healing of broken families
Can take greater risks for the gospel

[Notes]
celibacy offers some unique benefits:
deeper friendship
greater possibility for spiritual parenthood, leadership in the church, and the healing of broken families
able to take greater risks for the sake of the Kingdom (missionaries in dangerous places or experiments in community living)
and these are different than abstinent singleness (we all need to be good a cultivating friendship)



Called to Celibacy



Providing spaces for celibates to thrive is part of the Church’s DNA
Honor and support celibacy in practical and structural ways
Embrace and thrive in the calling
Celibacy and marriage are equal with different advantages and challenges

[Notes]
doing celibacy well was easy in a time and place where everyone lived in multi-family, multi-generational homes
but the wealth of our society has made that uncommon, if not weird
so how do we do this in a modern context?
we need a new narrative for this, a modern narrative for a modern problem
yet we aren’t without examples—creating space for celibate people dates back to the early church
the gospel called people to have one wife, which led to many widows
in Acts 6, the church accepted the responsibility to create space for those widows and provide for them
that is in the DNA of the Church

For those called to celibacy, the Church must honor and support that calling in practical and structural ways so that they can meet their intimacy needs in healthy ways.
Those who find themselves in continued celibacy, despite their desire to be married (whether because they are not yet married, widowed, divorced, or are sexual or gender minorities that believe they should not marry), will benefit from accepting their present circumstances, embracing their current calling, and learning to thrive in it.
These individuals may find it comforting (or discouraging) that Jesus recognized that some will be called to celibacy involuntarily but should accept and embrace their circumstances nonetheless.
We must recognize and teach that celibacy and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges.

Do you believe that marriage and celibacy are equally good with different benefits and challenges? What are those benefits and challenges?

Are you open to being called to celibacy? If not, why?

Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of abstinent singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to lifelong marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Others called to celibacy and intimate family in the Body of Christ

[Notes]
So to recap



Why does it matter?



Both are about embodying the gospel:
Diverse, intimate, and procreative relationships maintained by commitment and sacrifice point to the Trinity and Christ + the Church
Celibacy reflects Christ’s life and future patters in the New Heaven and New Earth

[Notes]
why is Christian orthodoxy about sexual stewardship important?
they are both ultimately about embodying the gospel and that makes it a gospel issue
all: we are all made for diverse, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment and hospitality that ultimately point to God’s love in the Trinity and for His people
celibate: reflects christ’s life and our future patterns in the NHNE



Share
What about this narrative is challenging? How does it contrast with the narrative of sexual fulfillment offered by culture and many churches?

THE PROBLEM




The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
We don’t really believe those things
Few churches teach those things
And even fewer put them into practice

[Notes]

we don’t really believe those things
few churches truly teach these things
and even fewer put them into practice



The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
Straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage
There is no support for celibacy
We live disconnected, isolated lives

[Notes]
we don’t refrain from emotional and physically intimate relationships before marriage
we assume we will be married, that marriage will satisfy, and that marriage is about making you happy
we no longer honor “through thick and thin” or see raising children as central
straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage

few consider celibacy as a calling
relegated to a curse of loneliness for the sake of the gospel
there is no support for celibacy because straight people aren't doing it

don’t learn to do friendship well, have loose friendships
fear of close, same-sex friendships
don’t do life as a Body of Christ



The Problem(s)



This hurts straight Christians
Children grow up hearing all people will be straight, married, and have kids
Failed marriages due to refusing a call to celibacy and inaccurate expectations
Celibates struggle with loneliness and married people raise children alone

[Notes]
important for straight people
children are hearing that all people will be straight, married, with kids
but for many than won’t be the case
many failed marriages due to refusing a call to celibacy
and not accurately seeing marriage as a vocation that is lifelong and difficult
marriages would endure if we communicated more accurate expectations
those called to celibacy need to see celibacy valued/celebrated and thriving modeled
and married people need help with kids from healthy celibates



The Problem(s)



Many people and circumstances on the margins:
Divorce
Widowing
Infertility
Pornography
Masturbation
Fornication
Adultery
Abortion
Contraception
Same-sex attraction
Broken gender

[Notes]
but there are lots of people and circumstances on the margins of that narrative
A lot of the ways that we do intimacy is broken
divorce
widowing
infertility
pornography (lust, objectification, selfish, commodification)
masturbation
sex outside of marriage
adultery
abortion
contraception
same-sex attraction
broken gender

these are communal sins that require communal responses

We should approach these people and circumstances through the framework of God’s narrative for sexual stewardship. How does that inform how we respond to these questions/challenges?

BETTER







Thriving in Celibacy
Model it – church leadership
Talk about it – across the lifespan
Discern it – listen and accept the call
Support it – integrate tem in families
Celebrate it – show that it is valued
A Vision for BETTER

[Notes]
connect married people with the challenges of celibate people by connecting with their loneliness, broken promises about marriage, difficulty, not being enough

model it
put celibate people in places of leadership and up front
unless see it valued won’t believe it is really a great option

talk about it across the lifespan
children need celibacy to be mentioned every time they talk about marriage
they need to have celibate people in their families
we need to preach about it
there need to be catechism opportunities around it

need a process of discernment to help accept a call to it

support it
they need intimate, spiritually procreative, and covenant-bound relationships that are maintained through sacrifice
people need to be given a vision of it and called to it
provide incubator where risk is reduced (subsidize it)
give instructions to make it happen
hold people accountable
seek out celibate people in the church and ask them about their experience
church language (“if” instead of “when”)

celibates as Godparents
calling families to include in rhythms, vacations, holidays, living
rhythms in the church to make this happen
help celibates create families of their own

celebrate it
mother’s day, father’s day, anniversaries, marriages, engagement parties, baptism, baby showers
what for celibates? how do we mark and celebrate their commitment?



So why me?
People like me are the only people seriously considering celibacy.

I am gay and a Christian and my understanding is that God calls all people to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex.




[Notes]
So why am I here?
the only people thinking about this are people like me
I am gay and a Christian and my understanding is that God calls all people to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
I believe I will enjoy the most goodness in my life if I obey God, and I don’t see a context for same-sex sexual or romantic relationship that God blesses
So I am forced to consider celibacy as a real option, but what I see in the Church is a place where centuries of straight Christians have ignored these teachings
not just to my detriment, but to theirs as well

On Friday, we’re going to get into the conversation about what the Bible says about same-sex attraction and same-sex marriage
In particularly, I’m going to share more of my story, talk about different ways of interpreting Scripture on this topic, and share why I’ve arrived at the beliefs that I have
