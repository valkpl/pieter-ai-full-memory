GAY PEOPLE

THE HOLY SPIRIT



& THE CHURCH

[Notes]
Welcome to Gay People, the Holy Spirit, and the Church

When gay people hear a Christian mention homosexuality, the Holy Spirit, and healing, they brace for what comes next.
Too often, they’ve been promised that if they prayed hard enough, the Holy Spirit would make them straight.
And then when their same-sex attractions persisted, the Church weaponized the Bible against them.
God wants to offer something better: a fruitful perseverance in the face of suffering.
So today I want to explore two big questions:
How has God invited gay people to steward their sexualities, and what is the Holy Spirit’s role in that stewardship?
Perhaps even more importantly: How has God called the Church to love gay people? And how will the Holy Spirit help the Church become a place where gay people can belong and thrive according to orthodox Christian sexual ethic?



Pieter Valk of

[Notes]
but first, a little about me
my name is Pieter Valk
I’m basically a lifelong Episcopalian/Anglican with couple of wandering years mixed in there
I’m a member of Church of the Redeemer in Nashville, TN and I’m currently in the process of ordination as a deacon
I studied at Vanderbilt University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and Lipscomb University
One day a week I work as a counselor meeting with people of all ages navigate questions of faith, sexuality, and identity
the rest of the week, I lead EQUIP, a team of missionary consultants committed to helping churches become places where gay people can belong and thrive according to biblical sexual ethics. 
In addition to that, I’ve help start the Nashville Family of Brothers, an ecumenically Christian monastery offering family to celibate Christian men in Nashville for God’s glory

There’s a reason why both of my jobs focus on the intersection of faith and sexuality: I am a Christian. I am gay. And I believe that God calls all Christians to celibacy or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex.

I want to make a quick note about terminology. I’m going to be using the word “gay” most frequently today as a general, catch-all term for people who are attracted to people of the same sex, whether they be gay, lesbian, or bisexual. I don’t mean to communicate anything about their theological beliefs or what kind of relationships they are seeking out by using that word. It only means “boys who like boys” or “girls who like girls”. There’s a whole bigger conversation to be had about what words Christians should use to describe themselves. But for now, I’ll use the word gay as I’ve defined it here.



GAY PEOPLE & THE HOLY SPIRIT





[Notes]
so gay people and Holy Spirit
there’s lot of baggage there
I think it’d be helpful to start by unpacking that and cleaning out some of the stuff that gets in the way of loving gay people like Jesus would
for decades, all gay people heard from the Church was that homosexuality was an abomination, people chose to be gay, if you prayed hard enough God would make you straight, gay people go to hell, and AIDS was God’s punishment for gay sex
what did this lead to?
millions of LGBT+ Christians lost their faith or committed suicide



Lost Faith & Suicide



22.4 million LGBT+ people
86% grew up in church
54% have left the faith
5X more likely to attempt suicide



[Notes]
In the most extensive study of LGBT+ people and the Church, Andrew Marin’s Us Versus Us reveals that of the 22.4 million LGBT+ people in the US, 19.3 million (86%) grew up in church. Of those, 10.4 million LGBT+ people have left the faith—that’s 54% of LGBT+ people who grew up in the Church—and their top reasons for leaving included negative personal experiences such as ex-gay programs. At the same time, gay teens are 5 times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers. LGBT+ youth who say religion is important to them are 38% more likely to be suicidal than their non-religious LGBT+ peers, suggesting that homophobic religious beliefs increase teens’ vulnerability to depression. And gay teens who come from highly rejecting families are 8.4 times more likely to attempt suicide than other gay teens. How are these related to “pray the gay away” practices inside churches and counseling centers? The primary solution churches and therapists offered gay people over the past half century was a false hope that anyone’s sexual orientation can change if they try hard enough. They were promised that God is good, He loves them, and He will heal them if they do their part. When that change didn’t occur, their hope for the future and their faith in God collapsed.



3 Main Questions



Are people born gay or choose to be gay?
What part did God play?
Can it change?

[Notes]
That brings up three big questions:
Are people born gay or choose to be gay?
What part did God play?
Can it change?






Are people born gay or choose to be gay?
None of us are how God made us to be
Neither born gay nor chose to be gay
Born or Choose?

[Notes]
First: Are people born gay or choose to be gay?
Well I want to make clear right from the start, I never chose to be gay, and you never chose to be straight
Now to the second question: are people born gay
Twins and hormone studies inconclusive, suggestion predisposition
The consensus of scientists…
Not genetically determined
But even if it was, that doesn’t tell us anything about God’s intentions, whether it is good
That’s a theological question, not a scientific question
Science can’t answer the question of God’s intentions because none of us are how God made us to be
corrupted at genetic level and raised in broken world
So my answer: neither born gay nor choose to be gay







What part did God play?
Does God make people gay?
Give people over to “a depraved mind”?
Allow people to develop same-sex attraction?
Play no part?
What about God?

[Notes]
Second Q:
What part did God play?







What part did God play?
Did not intend for anyone to be gay or make anyone gay (James 1:13, Romans 1:26-27) 
We are all corrupted at a genetic level and grow up in a broken world (Psalm 51:5) 
God allowed it to happen (Romans 5:12)
What about God?

[Notes]
Something unique about these verses in Romans is that they don’t just point out the sinful nature of same-sex sexual activity
Paul goes further in Romans to suggest that same-sex sexual desires themselves are not what God intended—they are broken. 
So, how do we answer that theological question on which science cannot comment?
Romans 1 teaches that same-sex sexual desires are unnatural, they are broken and contrary to God’s first intentions. 






What part did God play?
If God protected us from the consequences of our actions and the actions of others, would we really have choice?
God seeks to redeem all brokenness for our good and His glory (Romans 8:28) 
What about God?

[Notes]
Question of Evil
No good answer







Can it change?
No proven combination of spiritual disciplines or counseling to bring about change
Praying for change with any level of expectation is dangerous and unnecessary
Can it change?

[Notes]
Third question:
Do people’s sexual orientations change?

Scripture does not promise permanent relief from any temptation in this lifetime

Limited high-quality research demonstrates that only 3-4% of people who participated in sexual orientation change efforts experienced any change in their same-sex attractions, and even these results were from self-reports that cannot be verified.

No proven combination of spiritual disciplines or counseling to bring about change

Do miracles happen? Yes.

But praying for change with any level of expectation is dangerous.
The likelihood of your attractions changing even a little are the same as you getting into Harvard, becoming a millionaire, or playing high school baseball and eventually going pro. Would it be wise to pray for those things expectantly?
What happens when your faith in God, your belief that God is good, or your belief that God loves you hinges on whether you get into Harvard, become a millionaire, or your same-sex attractions change?
There is insufficient research about the effectiveness and harmfulness of sexual orientation change efforts in churches and counseling centers.
From my estimation of limited research and consistent anecdotal information, the frequent harm of ex-gay programs outweighs the benefits few experience.

Moreover, the search for change is unnecessarily risky: LGBT+ Christians don’t need to change their attractions to belong and thrive in our churches according to a traditional sexual ethic. Based on this, I would caution an individual from seeking to change their attractions. 

It’s a brokenness, but we don’t choose who we are attracted to and there is no formula for changing it
Better to ask God how he wants to redeem for my good and His glory






What does the Holy Spirit promise?
To dwell in us
To guide our thinking
To comfort us in suffering
To empower us to live in counter-cultural ways
To sustain our faith through sanctification
Gay People + HS

[Notes]
so if gay people aren’t promised that the HS will make us straight, then what?
what are we promised?
how is God calling gay people to steward their sexualities, and what is the Holy Spirit’s role in that stewardship?

the HS promises to dwell in us
to guide our thinking
to comfort us in suffering
to empower us to live in counter-cultural ways
and to sustain our faith through sanctification






“Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst?” (1 Cor 3:16)

“Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.” (1 Cor 6:19-20)
Dwell in us

[Notes]
first, the HS promises to dwell in us

1 Cor 3:16 reads: Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst?
and 1 Cor 6:19-20 reads: Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price.






Therefore, honor God with your body.

Sexual stewardship matters because our bodies are not our own, they have been bought at a price.
Dwell in us

[Notes]
Therefore honor God with your bodies.
it’s both a promise and a conviction
if the HS dwells in us, if our bodies are a temple, it matters how to take care of our temples
it matters how we steward our bodies
so to any, gay or straight, who asks why it matters who we do what with
because our bodies are not ours, they have been bought at a price






“For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.” (1 Corinthians 2:11)

“When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment” (John 16:8)
Guide our thinking

[Notes]
second, the HS promises to guide our thinking
1 Corinthians 2:11 reads: For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
John 16:8 reads: When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment






“For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.” (2 Peter 1:21)
Guide our thinking

[Notes]
and 2 Peter 1:21 reads: For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

the HS knows our thoughts, judges our thoughts, and guides our thoughts to better things
we need to think about our sexual stewardship in ways informed by the HS, all of us
but how, in particular, should we think about sexual stewardship for gay people?






Same-sex attraction is a brokenness
Being tempted is not a sin
We don’t choose who we’re attracted to
There’s no formula for sexual orientation change
All Christians are called to Christian celibacy or Christian marriage
Guide our thinking

[Notes]
I believe that experiencing same-sex attraction, me finding other guys physically attractive and desiring romantic relationships with them, being gay, is a result of the Fall
That when Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, their sin led to a domino effect of brokenness. Their sin bent all of the ways God had perfectly designed and ordered this world. To the extent that this world around us, the people around us, and even ourselves are not how God first imagined us.
I don’t think that when God first imagined me and projected me being born into a perfect world, he would have expected me to be gay
But because I was born into a broken world, one of the ways I was affected by that brokenness is that I gained these attractions

But I want to be clear that being gay, experiencing same-sex attraction, is not a sin
It is a brokenness, a temptation to sin, but God doesn’t hold against me my involuntary thoughts
God does not send people to hell merely because boys are attracted to boys or girls are attracted to girls
I do not believe people choose who they are attracted to, choose to be gay or straight
There is also no formula for changing a person’s attractions: no proven combination of prayer or counseling or weekend retreats to change someone’s sexual orientation

What does the Bible have to say about all of this? Well, as I understand it, and as a majority of Christians have understood the Bible for 2,000 years, God calls all Christians to celibacy--to refrain from sexual and romantic activity--or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex
there is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses in Scripture
same-sex sexual and romantic activity are sins

For me, while I’m not bisexual, I’m not generally attracted to women
I have been in a couple of relationships with women where I grew a desire for them specifically
so I knew that if God wanted me to get married to a women, that could work
but more important than what I want, I started asking God about 5 years ago what He wants
would He rather I get married or commit to celibacy
And about 3 years ago I felt strongly that God was calling me to celibacy
But no one can live life alone, so I’ve been exploring the possibility of starting an intentional Christian community with other men who feel called to celibacy, a monastery, you might say, where we can find committed family

now you might be wondering: this understanding is terribly inconvenient for me
how am I convinced that this is how God sees it?
most people start with the six passages in Scripture that many claim directly calls gay sex a sin
They are often called “the clobber passages”
I’m not going to get into those. I think they are meaningful evidence, but there’s also reasonable ways some people cast doubt on how convincing those 6 passages are
No, for me, what is truly convincing is not these few passages, but the whole of Scripture
consistently, Scripture reveals God’s design for our lives
God’s order for the world, even in the midst of brokenness
When it comes to what to do with our capacity for romance and sex, God seems to be pretty clear
there are two options for Christians: celibacy or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite
Jesus and Paul had a lot to say about both of those
they praised both and described both as having a specific design
In Matthew 19 and 1 Corinthians 7, they spoke of a committed celibacy where one gives up romance and marriage and sex to do kingdom work parents have a hard time finding the time and energy to carry out
And in Matthew 19 and Ephesians 5, Jesus and Paul spoke of Christian marriage as a lifelong partnership between a Christian man and woman for the purposes of enjoying intimacy with each other, raising children, and embodying the gospel
you see, the Christian should not approach God or the Bible with the question, “What is permissible, when it comes to my sexuality? What can I get away with?”
instead, we should ask, “What is most wise and most good? What is God’s best when it comes to my sexuality?”
God’s best for how Christians should steward their sexuality is clear: celibacy or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex
I’m not interested in settling for anything less than God’s best






“But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.” (John 14:26)

“And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.” (Romans 5:5)
Comfort in suffering

[Notes]
Third, the HS comforts us in suffering
John 14:26 reads: But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
Romans 5:5 reads: And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.






“When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.” (John 15:26)
Comfort in suffering

[Notes]
John 15:26 reads: “When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.
the HS is an advocate and a conduit of love

he comforts us in suffering
this is good news to gay Christians






Reassure that God is not surprised or waiting for orientation change

Reject shame as a barrier to intimacy

Be honest with God—He can take it
Comfort in suffering

[Notes]
For many gay people, we felt shame before God about our sexuality at an early age. Then, we tried to hide our sexuality from God so that we felt less shame. Next, the Bible and prayer were used as weapons by Christians trying to make us straight. And then, when we realized that we did nothing to bring our sexual orientation about, we couldn’t do anything to change it, and God didn’t respond to our pleas for Him to change it, we were angry at God for allowing us to be gay and not relieving us of this burden. All of this combines to leave gay people feeling like God is far away. They desperately want to feel close to God, but they don’t know how anymore. How can we care for gay people in this space

We can reassure them that God is not surprised, and He sees them as valuable (Psalm 139). Reassure gay people that they don’t have to become straight for God to love them. We are all broken and accepted before a gracious and merciful God who will never abandon us.

Shame is Satan’s primary weapon in many experiences that involve secrecy and particularly those that are sexual in nature. Respond to that shame by helping the individual identify and reject shaming messages they tell themselves and hear from others. People may find relief from shame when they share their stories with others.

Invite them to be honest with themselves and God—God can take it. Honestly sharing with God how we feel toward Him is intimate, even if our emotions are misplaced. Plus, avoiding emotions toward God that we think we aren’t supposed to feel can become a barrier to intimacy with God.






“May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.” (Romans 15:13)

“If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” (Luke 11:13)
Empower us to live

[Notes]
Fourth, the HS promises to empower us to live in counter-cultural ways
Romans 15:13 reads: May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Luke 11:13 reads: If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”






“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” (Acts 1:8)
Empower us to live

[Notes]
Acts 1:8 reads: But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
the HS is a provision from God to give us power, often in counter-cultural ways

one of the ways God calls gay people, in particular, to live counter-culturally is to reject widespread belief in American that we need romance and sex and have a right to it
yes we all need connection
to be in relationship
to know and be known
to give and receive love
and because we are mind, body, and spirit, we need connection on cognitive, physical, and spiritual levels






Neither sex nor marriage are promised or necessary to meeting our intimacy needs

None of us can meet our intimacy needs fully or finally in this lifetime (Isaiah 59:2)

If we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, our flesh will reach out for destructive and unsatisfying alternatives (1 Corinthians 7:1-40)

So seek healthy intimacy!
Empower us to live

[Notes]
but neither sex nor marriage are promised or necessary to meeting our intimacy needs
and because sins separate us from God and man, None of us can meet our intimacy needs fully or finally in this lifetime (Isaiah 59:2)
still, we need to meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways
because if we don’t our flesh will reach out for destructive and unsatisfying alternatives (1 Corinthians 7:1-40).

so how can gay people meet their intimacy needs?
like anyone else—by seeking deep, healthy intimacy
I have seen that when I’m getting what I really need—healthy friendship with other men—my desires for something romantic or sexual are easier to dismiss. So encourage those you disciple to seek out healthy relationships with safe friends. My life got better when I stopped ignoring my loneliness and started meeting my needs in healthy ways with deep friendship. And to this day, if I am struggling with lust, instead of shaming myself, I want my first response to be asking myself whether I have been meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways (usually I haven’t).






“And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.” (Ephesians 4:30)

“And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’” (John 1:33)
Sustain our faith

[Notes]
Fifth, the HS promises to sustain our faith through sanctification
Ephesians 4:30 reads: And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
John 1:33 reads: And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’






“Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” (Acts 2:38)
Sustain our faith

[Notes]
Acts 2:38 reads: Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

the HS sanctifies us and sustains us through that process
that faithfulness of the HS gives all of us hope
and it can particularly give the gay Christians hope






What can gay Christians hope for?
A lifetime of sanctification and sexual stewardship
Intimacy with God and His family and working to redeem the world
Obedience to God’s teachings and surrendering our brokenness to God will bring goodness (Jeremiah 7:23)
Sustain our faith

[Notes]
For gay people like me who have been stewarding our sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic for awhile, particularly in celibacy, our biggest question is, “What can we hope for?”
We can white-knuckle our way through celibacy for a couple of years
But after awhile its exhausting to walk out a vocation with often little support from our church, family, or friends
Plus as we age, our friends get married, have kids, and don’t have time or space for us in their lives
We’re tired of hearing pastors tell us, “Jesus can be everything you need,” when those pastors don’t live that life
Those pastors have a spouse and kids to go home to every night

So, what future can gay Christian hope for?










What can gay Christians hope for?
God invites everyone to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
At a church that’s ministering to gay people excellently, both are equally good and available to gay people
Sustain our faith

[Notes]
But there in lies the problem
I’ve never met a church that ministers to gay people excellently
If we’re being honest, most of your churches aren’t places that can offer gay people much hope right now
The best way you can answer this question is by being honest
For most of you, an honest answer is, “I wish this weren’t the case, but our church has been doing a poor job of supporting single and gay people for decades. I wish I could promise you that that will get better soon, but I can’t. The cross you’ll bear will probably be more painful than many of your peers. I am sorry. The world is not supposed to be this way. Our church is not supposed to be this way. So I personally give you permission to hold me feet to the fire on this. Don’t stop reminding me that things must be different, and quickly.”

Don’t be afraid to apologize for the sins of the Church, confess on behalf of the church
You don’t need to apologize for your beliefs, but you can apologize that the Church hasn’t done enough to be a place where gay people could thrive with reasonable effort according to a traditional sexual ethic

And finally after you apologize, affirm their need for committed, intimate family
Ultimately, they want hope that they will find family
God has created each of us for family
Yet most gay people have had a hard time finding it

So what can the Church do?




THE CHURCH & THE HOLY SPIRIT





[Notes]
Let’s talk about the church and HS
bad fruit NOT because gay people aren’t trying hard enough
its because theyre doing it on their own
we need to Church to step up
so, How has God called the Church to love gay people? And how will the Holy Spirit help the Church become a place where gay people can belong and thrive according to orthodox Christian sexual ethics?
we must offer gay people something better, and we aren’t yet
here’s five ways your church can offer something better






Invite all Christians to think theologically about their sexual stewardship
Everyone discerns between vocational singleness or Christian marriage

Something better

[Notes]
First,
We’ve got to invite all Christians to think theologically about their sexual stewardship

Most churches today lead straight Christians to assume that they will get married, teach that we need romantic companionship to be happy, and ignore the Bible’s teachings about lifetime celibacy and divorce.
This leads to high divorce rates and a void of theology and practice of lifetime abstinent singleness among straight Christians.
But then we call gay Christians to a higher standard of sexual stewardship by allowing straight Christians to misuse marriage for their romantic fulfillment while asking only gay Christians to consider celibacy.

Instead, our churches have got to become places where everyone in thinking theologically about their sexual stewardship
We need to teach that God first calls everyone to a period of abstinent singleness during which we discern whether we are called to a lifetime vocation of celibacy or a lifetime vocation of Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex.
These churches teach that every Christian has the same inherent capacity for both vocations and every Christian, gay or straight, should offer the question of celibacy or Christian marriage to God.






Talk publicly about the cultural questions in the intersection of faith and sexuality 
Straight people know how to love well and gay people know it’s safe to share

Something better

[Notes]
Second, 
Talk publicly about the cultural questions in the intersection of faith and sexuality

Most churches today avoid the topic of God’s love for gay people, so the average church-goer doesn’t know how to have compassionate and theologically accurate conversations with friends.
As a result, gay people don’t know whether it is safe to share their story.
Churches that sit the fence on this topic hurt gay Christians because their indecision limits their ability to invest in something better.

Instead, our churches need to become places that talk publicly about the cultural questions in the intersection of faith and sexuality.
With compassion and theological accuracy, they explore the following questions:
How does same-sex attraction develop?
What part did God play and why?
Does same-sex attraction change?
How should gay people meet their intimacy needs?
How do LGBT+ people fit in God’s story?
How is God’s invitation to LGBT+ people good?
As a result, everyone in your church knows how to love LGBT+ people well and reflect the love of Christ in conversations about sexuality.
Plus, LGBT+ people in your church still in the closet will know what you believe, your love for them, and that it is safe to share their story.






Share about the possibility of same-sex attraction in age-appropriate ways across the lifespan
Teens share quickly with parents and pastors after realizing they are gay

Something better

[Notes]
Third,
Talk about the possibility of same-sex attraction in age-appropriate ways across the lifespan

Most churches wait until a kid shares that he is gay to address the topic of homosexuality.
This is a problem.
On average, teens wait five years after first recognizing their same-sex attraction to talk to a parent or pastor.
That’s five years that a teen makes sense of these questions alone.
Most often, this means that a teen has either developed shame, depression, and suicidality or adopted a progressive sexual ethic (and often both).

Instead, churches need to become places that talk about same-sex attraction in age-appropriate ways across the lifespan.
Before a teen realizes he or she is gay, the teen hears that gay people don’t choose who they are attracted to, that they have nothing to be ashamed about, that we won’t try to fix them, that we don’t love them any less, and that God has good and beautiful plans for them.
Then, when teens realize they are gay, they quickly share with their parents and pastors, inviting them to help them learn how to steward their sexuality in God-honoring ways.






Provide effective pastoral care to gay people
Thriving in this life and deep relationships with God and others
Something better

[Notes]
Fourth,
Provide effective pastoral care to gay Christians

Unfortunately, many parents and pastors first react to a teen sharing about his attractions by sending him to a therapist or a parachurch ministry outside of the church to “fix” him.
Parents and pastors don’t know how to minister to gay teens well, so they outsource the care.
The shame and loneliness of gay teens is amplified because their challenges are treated as weird problems that need special treatment.
They are told to make sense of a key aspect of their personhood away from the church family they worship with, pray with, and take communion with.

Instead, churches need to become places where pastors and lay leaders know how to minister to LGBT+ Christians well.
They've done what it takes to gain the competency to provide pastoral care to gay people.
While licensed counselors still may be included to help address clinical levels of anxiety or depression, these churches recognize that same-sex attractions are not a mental illness to be cured.
Parents and pastors help gay people integrate their faith and sexuality in ways that lead to thriving in this life and deep relationships with God and friends.






Become places where gay people could thrive in celibacy or Christian marriage with reasonable effort
Celibate people can find intimate, committed family and MOMs are normalized and find support
Something better

[Notes]
And last but not least, 
Become places where gay people could thrive in celibacy or Christian marriage with reasonable effort

A lot of churches may have the right beliefs about sexual ethics, but the pathways for sexual stewardship they offer are inviable.
They are places where no one is thriving in celibacy or the complexities of marriage with someone of the opposite sex.
Essentially, they are walking gay teens to a desert, giving them a shovel and a bag of seeds, and then commanding them to thrive.
In response to the ways many have misused mixed-orientation marriage, the pendulum has swung the opposite direction and many churches teach that celibacy is the only option for gay people.
But these churches never teach about lifetime singleness, there are no models in their church for doing this well, and they don’t invite straight people to consider celibacy.
It begs the question: if we aren’t offering celibacy to straight people, do we really believe it is good?

Instead, churches need to become places where LGBT+ people could actually thrive in celibacy or a mixed-orientation marriage.
These churches teach about the theology of celibacy in Scripture, adults are modeling thriving in lifetime singleness and they are celebrated in the church, and the church invites all people—gay or straight—to discern whether God is calling them to celibacy or marriage.
Most importantly, these churches are places where celibate people can find the same depth of family that married people find, whether that be through intentional Christian communities of celibate (or celibate and married) people or helping celibates move in with marrieds to be a part of their family.
Then, these churches teach about the possibility of mixed-orientation marriages for gay people, cautioning against getting into these recklessly while highlighting the beauty and brokenness of real stories.






We partner with churches to help them cast vision, develop a strategy, and carefully implement that strategy.

Connect with EQUIP to learn more!
EQUIP can help

[Notes]
Most churches can’t do this work on their own
They’ll need a lot of help from the Holy Spirit, which I’ll get to in a second
And most churches will need an expert to help them cast a vision for better ministry, come up with a plan for realizing that vision, and carefully implement that plan

That’s exactly what EQUIP, the ministry I lead, does
we work with churches to help them become places where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic
And we do that by partnering with churches to help them cast vision, develop a strategy, and implement that plan carefully over time
We’ve worked with 2500 christian leaders at 35 churches, campus ministry, and christian univeristies in just 5 years

And while the ministry is ecumenically Christian, EQUIP has already worked with multiple Anglican churches

“And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’” (John 1:33)

“Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” (Acts 2:38)
Calls us to repent

[Notes]
But even if your church partners with EQUIP, we can’t accomplish anything without the Holy Spirit
So how does the Holy Spirit help the Church become a place where gay people can belong and thrive according to orthodox Christian sexual ethics?

First, The Holy Spirit calls us to repent
John 1:33 reads: And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’
Acts 2:38 reads: Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.






Before the Church steps forward, we much repent of the past

Identify and eliminate lingering pray-the-gay-away ideas and practices
Calls us to repent

[Notes]
One of the big ways the HS sanctifies us is by moving us to repent
Before our churches start taking steps forward, we first need to reckon with the past
The church needs to repent for ways we actively perpetrated or were complicit in pray-the-gay-away efforts
And we need to identify and eliminate the ways those ideas and practices still linger
Evangelical churches still preach that we choose who we are attracted to and that people like me sin by merely being attracted to other guys. We still hear that people are gay because they were raped or because they had bad parents. Same-sex sexual sin is treated as worse than opposite-sex sexual sin. We are told to keep working toward change if we want God to love us. And pastors and parents still send gay teens to therapists, weekend retreats, and parachurch ministries hoping they’ll return “fixed”.






“For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.” (1 Corinthians 2:11)

“When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment.” (John 16:8)
Guides our theology

[Notes]
Second, The HS guides our theology
1 Corinthians 2:11 reads: For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
John 16:8 reads: When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment







“For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.” (2 Peter 1:21)

Boldly teach all Christians to think theologically about their sexual stewardship and engage winsomely and with conviction publicly and in the home.
Guides our theology

[Notes]
and 2 Peter 1:21 reads: For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

We’ve said already that the HS guides our thinking and provides wisdom
Let’s recruit that wisdom when it comes to our theology
We need to boldly teach all Christians to think theologically about their sexual stewardship and engage in these conversations winsomely and with conviction inside our homes, inside our church, and everywhere else






“May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.” (Romans 15:13)

“If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” (Luke 11:13)
Empowers better

[Notes]
Third, The HS empowers us to offer something better
Romans 15:13 reads: May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Luke 11:13 reads: If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”






“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” (Acts 1:8)

In particular, help celibate people find family by initiating and supporting intentional Christian communities.
Empowers better

[Notes]
Acts 1:8 reads: But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”

We’ve already described how the Church can offer gay people something better
Let’s ask the HS to empower us to do it
I want to give you one specific and powerful example
Most gay Christians stewarding the sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic answer a call to celibacy
So one of the big ways we can offer something better to gay people is to help them find family in celibacy
We can help celibate people gather together and commit to being family for each other and doing rhythms of family together. Churches can help support celibate people in creating these intentional Christian communities by suggesting the idea, helping them cast vision for it, providing pastoral support while they explore the possibility, coaching them through the process, and maybe even providing financial support in the early years.

We’ve done just that in Nashville. A handful of us independently discerned that God was calling us to vocational singleness, but we weren’t sure how we would find intimate family we could depend on. I asked my pastor for his advice, and he responded with the following: “Monasticism isn’t the only way for celibate people to find family or necessarily the best way. But it has been the most common way. Monasticism has been the biggest source of theology in the Church. Monasticism has been the biggest source of evangelism in the Church. Monasticism has been the biggest source of social justice in the Church. You should consider it.” Two years later, we established the Nashville Family of Brothers, an ecumenically Christian monastery committed to offering family to celibate men in Nashville for God’s glory. We have family rhythms of daily prayer, weekly confession and accountability, monthly large-group prayer and worship gatherings, holidays and vacations, and shared mission work in our city. Brothers discern for at least four years before making final promises of celibacy, family, simplicity, and obedience to the Nashville Family of Brothers. Our monastery is ecumenically Christian, so our homes are not our primary places of worship. Instead, brothers are each required to be committed to the mission and community of each of their local churches. We each have jobs outside of the monastery. Instead of being cloistered, we live in single-family homes in the city next door to our friends who are parents. The doors of our home are always be open to extended friends and family, and we hope our monastery serves as a seed for a wider intentional Christian community of celibates and nuclear families in Nashville.

This is the kind of solution the Church needs, and our pastors were instrumental in establishing the Nashville Family of Brothers. Our pastors suggested the idea, they helped us cast vision for a modern and accessible expression of monasticism, they provided spiritual direction along the way, lead public ceremonies where we made commitments to the monastery, and they served as external accountability for the community
Regardless of which path they take, they need intimate, committed, and permanent family just like everyone else.






“But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.” (John 14:26)

“And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.” (Romans 5:5)
Provides hope

[Notes]
And Fourth, The HS provides hope and confidence even when overwhelmed
John 14:26 reads: But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
Romans 5:5 reads: And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.






“When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.” (John 15:26)

When helping gay people thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic feels too difficult, don’t give up. Find hope in the Holy Spirit.
Provides hope

[Notes]
John 15:26 reads: “When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.

God is calling the Church to a big work here
it will be difficult
so when it feels like too much, don’t find the easy out
don’t blame gay people
don’t cry about how the cross is too much
don’t ignore
ask the HS to provide us with the hope to keep going
for the sake of gay people in your families and churches
and the the sake of the whole church
