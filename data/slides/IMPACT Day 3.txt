Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
characteristics of healthy friendships
They are mutually supportive—that is, both people feel that they are able to be listened to, heard, and that the other person values their thoughts feelings, and opinions.
That are honest—one person can share what is going on inside and the other person feels like he or she can do the same.
They are real—both friends feel like they can be who they are without putting on any masks.
They are not exclusive—they may have a circle of close friends or even a “best friend”; however, there are other people they call “friends”
They are not defining—they are known as more than just the “friend of ___” and their friend is known broadly also
They are respectful—neither friend is critical or degrading of the other person

friendships take time to build
normal to begin with surface-level conversations and experiences
important to hold back in early stages to protect self (also normal)
