DEVELOPMENT




Sexual Identity Development



Recognize they experience same-sex attraction and are different than peers

Same-sex sexual behavior

Label oneself as gay/lesbian/bisexual

Ongoing relationship with the same sex

Disclosure to another person
12 - 14
16 - 17
17 - 18
15 - 18
17 - 18

[Notes]
What do you notice about all of these?
milestones happen in high school
college is too late!
parents dont know what they’re doing!
Disclosure is often the last step or at least after recognizing one’s attractions, experimenting, and having a first same-sex relationship



Pump the brakes



Many Christians who experience same-sex attraction did not have those milestones
Only 26% reported engaging in same-sex sexual behavior
Only 11% labeled themselves as gay/lesbian/bisexual
Only 18% were in ongoing same-sex relationships

[Notes]
SSA Christians haven’t given up or given in
None of these things were true for me in high school
Don’t throw in the towel for them
Not hopeless
So what do we do?






Because milestones occur before disclosure, ministry cannot be reactive:
Preemptively talk about these questions and provide answers
Build trust and openness with how we talk about this topic
Be patient as youth make sense of these questions when they do share
Impact on ministry?

[Notes]
So how should this information impact our ministry?






What do SSA students need to hear before they come out?
God’s narrative of sexual stewardship for all people
How that’s good for SSA students
Answers to the big questions
An invitation to share


Impact on ministry?

[Notes]
what do youth need to hear before they come out?

If all they hear is that God is against homosexuality, we are setting up the children in our church to either embrace homosexuality or to struggle with deep shame, loneliness, depression, and suicidality, OR BOTH
This has been my experience in my own life and the lives of others

We need to offer them something good, something better, something compelling, something they can say “yes” to

They need to hear how God has called us to steward our sexualities
They need to hear what that means for people who experience same-sex attraction, how that is good for them, and how they still fit in God’s family
They need to hear the answers to the big questions: how same-sex attraction develops, what part God played and why, how one should identify, how to have healthy relationships, etc.
In doing all of this, you need to demonstrate that you are someone they can trust, and you need to specifically and repeatedly invite them to share with you and/or their parents if same-sex attraction is a part of their story



Turn & Talk



What are the benefits of sharing these with students before they are 12? Barriers?

THEOLOGY


[Notes]
How can we talk about SSA in theologically accurate and compassionate ways?
In particular, I want to model how you can share God’s narrative for sexual stewardship for all people with students like I mentioned earlier
Then I’ll highlight what that means for people who experience same-sex attraction, how that is good for them, and how they still fit in God’s family




Spot-checking fails



Preponderance of Biblical support

Same-sex sexual activity is sin (Genesis 19; Romans 1; Leviticus 18:22; Leviticus 20:13; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10; 1 Timothy 1:8-10) 

Marriage defined between man and women (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-5) 

Context of rape, incest, adultery, or sex outside of marriage (Genesis 19:1-9) 

Written for a people in a time and place

[Notes]
But why do we need to start with God’s narrative for sexual stewardship for all people?
For a lot of reasons, that we will get to
But for the purposes of this training, the biggest reason is that merely spot-checking the clobber passage isn’t convincing

Let’s take a look at the verses people typically reference on this topic and why I feel like we need more

Preponderance, but not certainty
And telling people “no” isn’t enough

We need to offer people something to say “yes” to
We need to offer what is most good
We have to share how God has invited all people to steward their sexualities and then highlight how that is good for people who experience same-sex attraction
The best way to talk about the ways this world is broken is to first talk about God’s intentions for flourishing and then ask how that should inform how we respond to the brokenness
So let’s do that






Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of abstinent singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to lifelong marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Others called to lifelong celibacy and intimate family in the Body of Christ

[Notes]
Here is my summary of God’s narrative for sexual stewardship




Created for Love



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matthew 19:3-12, Mark 10:2-12, Genesis 1:26-27)
Intimate (1 John 4:19)
Procreative (Genesis 1:28)
Faithful (Isaiah 54:6-8, Hosea 3:1)
Sacrificial (Ephesians 5:23, Galatians 6:2)

[Notes]
We need to start by looking at who God is and how He loves



Created for Love



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

Sexuality – our need for relationship, to know and be known, to give and receive that kind of love

[Notes]
A - we are all made for diverse, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment and sacrifice

B - and because we are mind, body, and spirit, we need connection on cognitive, physical, and spiritual levels



Created for Love



We are all created for family in the Body of Christ (Genesis 2, Leviticus 26:12) 

Family – a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other

Neither sex nor marriage is promised or necessary to meet our intimacy needs

[Notes]
but where and how we find that may look different depending on whether we are called to celibacy or marriage



Created for Love



None of us can meet our intimacy needs fully or finally in this lifetime (Isaiah 59:2)

If we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, our flesh will reach out for destructive and unsatisfying alternatives (1 Corinthians 7:1-40)



Our first calling



A period of abstinent singleness
Enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ
Called to neither lifelong celibacy nor marriage
Submit our sexuality to God, study the Scriptures, discern with God and others

[Notes]
A - What are we called to? How do we meet our intimacy needs?

B - We should not assume that we are called to marriage just because we have sexual desires, want to be a parent, or find abstinent singleness to be too challenging. 



Turn & Talk



We are all created for family, yet neither sex nor marriage is promised or necessary to meet our intimacy needs. How can that be so?
What might this discernment process look like?
Does God allow people to have significant sexual desires, a desire to be a parent, and allow them to struggle with abstinent singleness yet call them to a lifetime of celibacy? How is that good?
1:17.5

What’s the Bible say…



…about celibacy and marriage?
Matthew 19:8-12
Better to be celibate if cannot accept what Christian marriage is
We do not choose celibacy or marriage, we are called

[Notes]
So what does the Bible say about celibacy and marriage?
Highlight two big passages in this conversation

In Matthew 19:8-12, Jesus calls married people to a deeper level of commitment to each other. 

He recognizes that for those who cannot make this level of commitment, it would be better for them not to marry. 
Some have been called to marriage, others have been called to celibacy. 
To illustrate this point, Jesus compares our experience to that of a eunuch—a person who refrains from sex and is not married. 
He notes that some are this way because of how they are born (genital defects); that some are made eunuchs by others (referring to genital mutilation, enslavement, and any other involuntary process); and that others choose this lifestyle (choose lifelong celibacy). 

Importantly, Jesus recognizes that celibacy is not always chosen and that some who are called to celibacy are called involuntarily.



What’s the Bible say…



…about celibacy and marriage?
1 Corinthians 1: 7-8, 32-25
Preference for celibacy
Marriage will be a gift to those who are called to it

[Notes]
In 1 Corinthians 1: 7 and 8, Paul recommends that Christians refrain from sex and not marry. 

He communicates a preference for celibacy and a desire that all would be celibate, but he recognizes that all are not called to celibacy. 

Paul recognizes that for those who are called to marriage, that will be a gift as well. 
Continuing in verses 32 through 35, he advocates for celibacy because the concern of the celibate is not divided between God and one’s spouse and children.

The New Testament strongly encourages celibacy and recognizes that celibacy is given, not chosen—some will find themselves called to celibacy despite their personal preference.
The New Testament allows for marriage for those who are called to it, recognizing that marriages provides a vision of Christ’s relationship with the Church that ministers to both those who are married and those who are celibate.
Nevertheless, the Bible recognizes that marriage is difficult and should be entered into cautiously. 
Ultimately, the Bible comes up just short of calling all people to celibacy, but it also reprimands the person who assumes he or she will be married.




Called to Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime vocation between a man and a woman to enjoy intimacy, raise children for the Body of Christ, and embody the gospel for each other and the world

[Notes]
Let’s talk about these two vocations practically



Called to Marriage



How does marriage embody the gospel?
Complementary of the genders/sexes both psychologically and biologically reflect the Trinity and Christ’s relationship with the Church
Intimate – sexually, emotionally, and spiritually



Called to Marriage



How does marriage embody the gospel?
Procreative – raise children
Faithful – lifetime commitment
Sacrificial – of personal desires and preferences

[Notes]
those called to marriage will thrive when they seek to fulfill these purposes
Churches must teach accurately about what marriage is and support families to keep their vows and raise children



Turn & Talk



Both Jesus and Paul seem to communicate a preference for celibacy. How do we square that with the low frequency of celibate people in our churches and the high place marriage holds?
The idea that Christian marriage must embody the procreative and complementary natures of God’s love has been contentious. How essential are these? What are the consequences of dismissing these as essential?
1:31.5

[Notes]

Called to Celibacy



Celibacy is NOT a call to loneliness for the sake of the gospel

Celibacy IS a call to diverse, intimate, and spiritually procreative relationships that are maintained by commitment and sacrifice

[Notes]
This is really important for me as someone called to lifelong celibacy
It is still a call to satisfying companionship that I can depend on
I still need and should have friendships that I do life with daily where we are committed to each other and can expect each other to be a part of each others’ lives for the next 30 years



Called to Celibacy



Unique benefits:
Deeper friendship
Greater possibility for spiritual parenthood, church leadership, and healing of broken families
Can take greater risks for the gospel

[Notes]
People often ask: why do we need to distinguish between a period of abstinent singleness versus a lifelong vocation of celibacy? What’s the difference?
While they have some similar rhythms and challenges, they are very different
A period of abstinent singleness is not a vocation, it is a time of waiting and discerning
Where as a commitment to lifetime celibacy is, in part, an acceptance that one will not get married
One of the big differences is that a person is not willing to make the commitments and sacrifices necessary to find family in the Body of Christ outside of marriage until a person has accepted that he or she will not be married
Does that make sense?
A person still in the period of abstinent singleness with the possibility of marriage can’t make a commitment to a group of other single Christians to essentially be family for each other for the next 40 years
But a person committed to celibacy can



Called to Celibacy



Providing spaces for celibates to thrive is part of the Church’s DNA
Honor and support celibacy in practical and structural ways
Embrace and thrive in the calling
Celibacy and marriage are equal with different advantages and challenges

[Notes]
doing celibacy well was easy in a time and place where everyone lived in multi-family, multi-generational homes
but the wealth of our society has made that uncommon, if not weird
so how do we do this in a modern context?
we need a new narrative for this, a modern narrative for a modern problem
yet we aren’t without examples—creating space for celibate people dates back to the early church
the gospel called people to have one wife, which led to many widows
in Acts 6, the church accepted the responsibility to create space for those widows and provide for them
that is in the DNA of the Church

For those called to celibacy, the Church must honor and support that calling in practical and structural ways so that they can meet their intimacy needs in healthy ways.

Those who find themselves in continued celibacy, despite their desire to be married (whether because they are not yet married, widowed, divorced), will benefit from accepting their present circumstances, embracing their current calling, and learning to thrive in it.
These individuals may find it comforting (or discouraging) that Jesus recognized that some will be called to celibacy involuntarily but should accept and embrace their circumstances nonetheless.

We must recognize and teach that celibacy and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges.



Turn & Talk



When done well, those called to celibacy enjoy companionship in intimate, committed relationships that is as fulfilling as marriage. How can celibate people enjoy this ”family” in the Body of Christ? What are the greatest challenges to realizing that? How can our churches help celibate people experience that?

Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of abstinent singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to lifelong marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Others called to lifelong celibacy and intimate family in the Body of Christ

[Notes]
Here is my summary of God’s narrative for sexual stewardship

God offers relationship with Him and the Body of Christ as the solution to loneliness
Spiritual friendship is a satisfying source of companionship available to all
Marriage is a vocation for the purpose of raising children
God calls many to a flourishing life of celibacy
All enjoy deep friendship in the Body of Christ and support each other in their vocations



Why does it matter?



Both are about embodying the gospel:
Diverse, intimate, and procreative relationships maintained by commitment and sacrifice point to the Trinity and Christ + the Church
Celibacy reflects Christ’s life and future patterns in the New Heaven and New Earth

[Notes]
why is Christian orthodoxy about sexual stewardship important?



Why does it matter?



Many people and circumstances on the margins:
Divorce
Widowing
Infertility
Pornography
Masturbation
Fornication
Adultery
Abortion
Contraception
Same-sex attraction
Broken gender

[Notes]
What does this have to do with SSA and SSM?
This narrative is the best ways to address sexual brokenness. Making loud arguments against what is bad isn’t compelling. Let’s offer how we can flourish. And then ask how that narrative could inform how we respond to brokenness.
Here’s a list of all of the ways sexuality is broken as a result of the Fall
Some of these are the result of personal sin, others are the result of the sins of others
But all of these are communal sins that require communal responses

In light of this narrative, how should we respond to same-sex attraction? What does that mean for same-sex sexual and romantic intimacy? Same-sex marriage? What is God offering those who experience same-sex attraction? Is it good?




Applying God’s narrative
Same-sex attraction is not God’s intention and is a result of the Fall
Same-sex sexual/romantic activity is sinful
God does not bless same-sex marriages because they fall outside of God’s design for marriage
There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses




[Notes]
We don’t even need to clobber passages to arrive at 3 and 4, which highlights that regardless of debate around their specific meaning, the broader narrative of scripture does not bless same-sex marriage



Side A



God makes people gay
God blesses same-sex marriages in the same ways that He blesses opposite-sex marriages
Requires theological maneuvering or a belief that the Bible is not binding/prescriptive for a modern context 



Side B



Same-sex attraction is a result of the Fall
We do not choose who we are attracted to and there is no formula for changing one’s attractions
Same-sex romantic and sexual activity are sins
All people are called to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Christians can identify as gay in limited ways




Side X



Same-sex attracted Christians must reject their attractions and work toward change
Continuing to experience SSA is a sign of willful disobedience
Homosexuality is sinful
God intends for all people to marry someone of the opposite sex



How is this good?



If the Church did this well, it would be a place where those who experience SSA could thrive in celibacy or a mixed orientation marriage (MOM)

Their callings would be just as beautiful and the challenges would be no greater

[Notes]
what does that mean for those who experience SSA?
and why does God’s narrative for sexual stewardship matter to us?

celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex (just like straight people!)
I can imagine yall have a lot of thoughts and feelings about MOMs – hold that, we will get to it very soon

church where celibacy taught and valued and just as good
other straight people celibate and thriving
church that recognizes brokenness and talks about brokenness of sexuality
also recognizes what marriage really is
so can thrive in MOM

everyone enjoys meaningful community in the Body of Christ



Turn & Talk
What about this narrative is challenging? How does it contrast with the narrative of sexual fulfillment offered by culture and many churches? How could we share this with teens and adults?

How is this narrative good and beautiful and compelling for LGBT+ people?

PROBLEMS


[Notes]
but that assumes that the Church is doing this well
news story: We AREN'T
where are our areas of growth?
we can’t get better until we admit we have a problem and we identify them




The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
We don’t really believe those things
Few churches teach those things
And even fewer put them into practice



What we believe…



If God gives people desires to marry and have kids, then He wants them to marry
Marriage is primarily about companionship and mutual fulfillment
If we get married, we only have to have kids if and when we want them
God calls a select few to celibacy and sustains them spiritually
Friendship can’t provide what marriage can and shouldn’t be too close



Turn & Talk
How are these beliefs problematic? What are the consequences of these beliefs for all people and specifically SSA teens?



2:12

[Notes]
ISL



The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
Straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage
There is no support for celibacy
We live disconnected, isolated lives

[Notes]
As a result,

we don’t refrain from emotional and physically intimate relationships before marriage
we assume we will be married, that marriage will satisfy, and that marriage is about making you happy
we no longer honor “through thick and thin” or see raising children as central
straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage

few consider celibacy as a calling
relegated to a curse of loneliness for the sake of the gospel
there is no support for celibacy because no straight people aren't doing it

don’t learn to do friendship well, have loose friendships
fear of close, same-sex friendships
don’t do life as a Body of Christ



The Problem(s)



This hurts Christians who experience SSA
Cannot thrive in celibacy or a MOM
We offer only Side A or Side X
Why should gay people be called to a higher standard of sexual stewardship?

[Notes]
we don’t offer an alternative that recognizes the challenges and answers questions people have

if we do not do this, we cannot blame unmarried people for reaching out for forbidden things from a place of loneliness

if straight people aren’t taking marriage seriously or considering celibacy, why should gay people call themselves to a higher standard of sexual stewardship



The Problem(s)



This hurts straight Christians, too
Children grow up hearing all people will be straight, married, and have kids
Failed marriages due to refusing a call to celibacy and inaccurate expectations
Celibates struggle with loneliness and married people raise children alone



Turn & Talk
How have you seen these shortcomings in your community?

How have they impacted Christians in your community—both gay and straight?

BETTER


[Notes]
So how can we do this better as a church, and specifically, how can we become places where gay Christians can thrive in celibacy or a MOM

How are these suggestions for doing this better as a church relevant for SSA teens? If SSA teens don’t see people thriving in these vocations, they will never consider them as real options. So helping SSA adults realize these serves your teens.




A Vision for Better



Offer God’s narrative for sexual stewardship for all people
Talk about the people and circumstances in the margins, including SSA
Start talking about this at an early age
Effectively minister to LGBT+ people
Become churches where people can thrive in celibacy and MOMs

[Notes]
In short, if you want to serve LGBT+ people well, it takes more than a pastor who can minister individual to LGBT+ people. That is good, and if that pastor truly grasps the complexity of the problem, he or she can lead that congregation toward a real solution:

we covered the first, second and third already
and we will talk about ministering in our next section
let’s talk specifically about that last point




Thriving in Celibacy



Model it – church leadership
Talk about it – across the lifespan
Discern it – listen and accept the call
Support it – integrate tem in families
Celebrate it – show that it is valued

[Notes]
model it
put celibate people in places of leadership and up front
unless see it valued won’t believe it is really a great option

talk about it across the lifespan
children need celibacy to be mentioned every time they talk about marriage
they need to have celibate people in their families
we need to preach about it
there need to be catechism opportunities around it

need a process of discernment to help accept a call to it

support it
they need intimate, spiritually procreative, and covenant-bound relationships that are maintained through sacrifice
people need to be given a vision of it and called to it
provide incubator where risk is reduced (subsidize it)
give instructions to make it happen
hold people accountable
seek out celibate people in the church and ask them about their experience
church language (“if” instead of “when”)

celibates as Godparents
calling families to include in rhythms, vacations, holidays, living
rhythms in the church to make this happen
help celibates create families of their own

celebrate it
mother’s day, father’s day, anniversaries, marriages, engagement parties, baptism, baby showers
what for celibates? how do we mark and celebrate their commitment?



Thriving in MOMs



Teach accurately about what marriage is and isn’t to normalize MOMs
Encourage MOMs to share about SSA inside and outside of the marriage, accept that it will probably always be there, and steward it together

[Notes]
define

pendulum over past few decades
80s, 90s, and early 00s - everyone needs to marry + pray the gay away
late 00s, 10s - reaction to failures, everyone needs to be celibate

don't pressure people into them: doesn’t work for everyone
what the bible has to say about celibacy

don’t discredit: we only hear about the ones that fail

when it’s done well
talk about it before engagement (recognize that it will always be a part of marriage—it returns, work of Satan)
talk about it in marriage
talk about it with other couples
opinions of secular sex therapists: recipe for marital satisfaction and sexual satisfaction is emotional intimacy + commitment (sexual attraction not necessary)

So as a result

talk about them and normalize them

talk about what marriage is and isn’t:
If marriage is primarily about sexual attraction and companionship, then perhaps MOMs won’t work
But if it’s about emotional intimacy and vulnerability, commitment, and raising children together, then they can thrive

share with other person, recognize it will always be there, steward together, share with others (to see that most of your challenges are universal and not due to SSA)




Turn & Talk
What are your reservations and fears about MOMs? Could they work for those called to them?
What steps is your community willing to take to become a place where LGBT+ people can thrive in celibacy or a MOM?
If people who experience SSA were thriving in celibacy and MOMs in your church, how might that encourage SSA teens?

Twins and hormone studies inconclusive, suggestion predisposition
Not genetically determined
Not chosen




Ministering: Core Q’s



How does same-sex attraction develop?
Understanding developmental factors may help an individual gain acceptance but should not be addressed with the goal of “fixing” the individual

[Notes]
For me this was helpful because it wasn’t a mystery anymore.
My experience also breaks the duality—it doesn’t fit in the culture war




Ministering: Core Q’s



Will my same-sex attraction change?
There is no promise of change in attractions
Some will experience change and some will not, but not as a reflection of how hard we want it or work at it

[Notes]
I have experienced a decrease in frequency and magnitude of my same-sex attractions
But still a daily challenge, I expect it always will be
I’ve moved on from asking God to change this, and that has been really healthy for me
False hope in my life was very destructive for a long time

What part did God play and why?
Did not intend for anyone to be gay or make anyone gay (James 1:13)

God allowed it to happen        (Romans 5:12)

Where is God in all of this?
Be honest with God—He can take it (Genesis 32:22-32)
Frame within God’s universal intentions of intimacy and sexuality (Genesis 2)

I was really angry with God but suppressed that angers for a decade
Finally, I had a mentor who encouraged me to be honest
Jacob wrestling God—it is intimate
I had to express that anger before I could believe that God loves me—and honestly, I am still working through that

Who am I in light of what I am feeling?
Name and affirm experience while encouraging delayed identification
Distinguish between attractions, orientation, identity, and behavior
Radical acceptance: acknowledge and commit to work through

I am a child of God, first and foremost
And I accept that same-sex attraction is a part of my story
And it has significantly impacted my journey and how I see the world
What do I do with that? How do I label that?

For me, it has been helpful to identify as a gay Christian
Shared heritage
Similar life experiences
Unique perspective in the Body of Christ
Still secondary and operated by my identity in Christ
In Heaven, with bind some but divide none

When we tell people to hide their attractions
Not to talk about them

 How do I refrain from behavior?
Pray for strength
Eliminate opportunities
Accountability
Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
Important distinction here about sexual addiction
Many gay Christians I know suffer from sexual addiction
Not because SSA is the result of sexual addiction itself
But because pornography, masturbation, and acting out with others was the solution we found to medicate the shame and loneliness we felt from being a Christian and experiencing same-sex attraction
This developed into an addiction that we will have to manage for the rest of our lives
But not all gay Christians struggle with sexual addiction
And there are plenty of straight Christians who struggle with sexual addiction

That’s all to say, if someone struggle with sexual addiction (gay or straight), accountability and managing temptation is going to look different and I encourage you to connect them with recovery programs specifically for sex addicts






 How do I meet my intimacy needs?
What are my needs?
Normalize
Jesus: angels in the wilderness and disciples in Gethsemane
Stewardship of meeting in healthy ways

Ministering: Core Q’s






 How do I meet my intimacy needs?
Same-sex attractions are unmet needs for healthy same-sex intimacy that have been sexualized
Seek healthy relationships with safe friends

Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
Encourage healthy relationships with others

My life got better when I stopped ignoring my loneliness and started meeting my needs in healthy ways with deep friendship
And to this day, if I am struggling with lust, instead of shaming myself, I want my first response to be asking myself whether I have been meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways (which I haven’t)







 What does the future look like?
A lifetime of sanctification and sexual stewardship
Intimacy with God and His family and working to redeem the world
Obedience to God’s teachings and surrendering our brokenness to God will bring goodness (Jeremiah 7:23)
Ministering: Core Q’s






 What does the future look like?
God invites everyone to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Both are equally good and available to those who experience same-sex attraction
Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
A lot of my depression came from this feeling that my future would only contain continued suffering. 
As a child, I was led to believe that a wife and kids are what would make me most happy. And society tells me that if I only had a relationship with a guy I am attracted to, I would be most happy.
But my attractions and beliefs make none of those an option
So you can see how it would be easy to despair
It wasn’t until I rejected those “promises” as false and learned what God really offers that I saw that my life can be just as beautiful as anyone else’s (if the Church does a better job of supporting celibates and MOMs)




Turn & Talk
Leaning into healthy intimacy with same-sex friends seems counterintuitive. What are some ways your community has encouraged healthy intimacy?
How could you preemptively address these questions among your students?
How could you use discussion around these questions to disciple an SSA teen?

Training Questions
When and how do teens make sense of SSAs?
How can we talk about SSA in theologically accurate and compassionate ways?
How are we doing as a Church, and how could we do this better?
How can we walk alongside students as they ask the big questions? 






A Vision for Better



Offer God’s narrative for sexual stewardship for all people
Talk about the people and circumstances in the margins, including SSA
Start talking about this at an early age
Effectively minister to LGBT+ people
Become churches where people can thrive in celibacy and MOMs
