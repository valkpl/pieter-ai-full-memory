Pastors & Ministry Leaders Track

[Notes]
Welcome to the Pastors & Ministry Leaders Track!
Pastors & Ministry Leaders Track
Our goal: to help you lead your churches to become places where LGBT+ people can flourish according to historic Christian sexual ethics.

We want to help you become
Leaders to Flourishing.

[Notes]
Revoice exists to help your churches become places where LGBT+ people can flourish according to historic Christian sexual ethics.

Michelle, Bruce, and I share that hope, and today we want to help you take a few meaningful steps in that direction. We want to help you, Christian leaders, lead your churches to become places where LGBT+ can flourish. Or in a few words, we want you to become "Leaders to Flourishing."

We will do that in 5 ways:
Pastors & Ministry Leaders Track
Leaders to Flourishing
Michelle:	Transformative Vision and Strategy
Bruce:	 	Modeling and Teaching Historic 					Christian Sexual Ethics
Pieter: 		Answering the Big Questions

LUNCH BREAK (12:30 PM to 2 PM)

Panel: 		Church Accountability and Discipline
Q&A: 		What are you afraid of?
				Text your questions to 423-914-6258

[Notes]
Michelle will start by providing a framework for a longterm, wholistic vision and strategy for your church or denomination. How can you steward a movement that leads to deep transformation and bears good fruit for gay and straight people in your church?

Bruce will follow by demonstrating how pastors can invite all Christians, gay or straight, to think theologically about their sexual stewardship, how pastors can lead by modeling that in their personal lives, and how pastors can compassionately navigate resistance.

Next, I will give you language to engage in some of the trickiest conversations, including development of sexual orientation and change, sexual identity, how gay people can meet their intimacy needs in God-honoring ways, and what good things God has to offer LGBT+ people, in particular.

We’ll go until 12:30 pm. Then we'll take a break for lunch until 2 pm.

But after lunch, the three of us will tag-team to tackle one of the most difficult areas of pastoral care: church accountability and discipline. How can you show grace and confront sin effectively? We’ll even address how your church can minister to a same-sex married couple with kids who want to be part of your church while maintaining a progressive sexual ethic.

Then last but not least, we will round out our time with a segment we’re calling, “What are you afraid of?”
Throughout our time together, we want you to submit your toughest questions. What are you always afraid to ask? Text your questions to (423) 914-6258, and we will address them after lunch.
