IS SINGLENESS GOOD?
Discovering a Protestant Theology and Practice of Celibacy

[Notes]
Hello, I am Pieter Valk

I studied at Vanderbilt University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and Lipscomb University
I have my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and one day a week I meet with LGBT+ undergraduate students at a Christian university navigating questions of faith, sexuality, and identity

And the rest of the week, I’m the Executive Director of EQUIP
A team of missionary consultants committed to equipping the Church with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction
Or to put it another way
We partner with churches to help them become places where LGBT+ people can belong and thrive according to an orthodox Christian sexual ethic

But today we aren’t talking about serving LGBT+ people—or at least we aren’t talking about it directly

Today, we’re focusing on lifetime singleness, celibacy, for all people

I’m curious
When you hear the word celibacy, lifetime singleness
What image comes to mind?

do you see a nun
looming over a school child
scolding him for misbehavior
smacking him on the hand with a ruler?

or a balding man with a crown of hair in a robe
kneeling alone in his room
praying for hours
miles away from civilization?

do you think of lonely people, isolated from the church, their potential for contributing to the local church wasted?

If that’s what comes to mind, it’s reasonable to ask “Is Singleness Good?”
Is Celibacy Really Good?

My hope is that after today not only will you cherish the way Scripture speaks about lifetime singleness and return eagerly to your church to better support celibate people

but that when you hear the word celibacy
lifetime singleness
a different image comes to mind

instead, you imagine 

someone who looks like you or me
who felt called to lifetime singleness and embraced it eagerly
who has leaned into that by engaging deeply in the work of your church
they are a leader, a mentor to many, a prayer warrior, and a teacher
they’ve amplified your church’s ministry to the poor, sick, immigrants, refugees, and those struggling with mental illness
and they are happy and thriving
they've found committed family in your church

THE NEED


[Notes]
Despite the encouragements to consider lifetime singleness in Scripture, the stated value of celibacy, the promise of a gift to thrive in this vocation, a promise of an 100-fold blessing in this life, Jesus radically lifting up celibacy from being a curse for a few to a normative vocation for many, and the countless examples of celibate Christian leaders throughout history including Jesus and Paul—despite all of this, our churches don’t teach the rich theology of lifetime singleness in Scripture, and there is little support for celibate Christians, leading to painful results for the Church.



The Need
The Church fails to TEACH about,
MODEL,
Help people DISCERN a calling to,
SUPPORT, or
CELEBRATE lifetime singleness




[Notes]
The Church fails to teach about, model, help people discern a calling to, support, or celebrate lifetime singleness. Instead, we hear false teachings that celibacy is loneliness for the sake of the gospel, that marriage is better and more beautiful than celibacy, and that you only have to be celibate if God disrupts your life and gives you an undeniable call. We teach that it is our choice whether we get married or commit to celibacy. We hear that celibacy is only for asexual people or it’s only for gay people or it's only for those people who don't want to be married or have children. Somehow, our churches are stuck in Old Testament theology of marriage and singleness. We don’t grow up seeing thriving in celibacy modeled in our churches. Our churches don’t invite anyone to discern whether God has called them to celibacy or marriage. And while a laundry list of days celebrate the vocation of marriage—engagement parties, marriages, wedding anniversaries, baby showers, baptisms, Mother’s Day, and Father’s Day—nothing marks and celebrates the vocation of celibacy.



The Need
The Results? Single people suffer.




Loneliness leads to doubt, depression, suicidality, sex outside of marriages, and hasty marriages
80% have sex before marriage

[Notes]
What are the results? 

Single people suffer.
48% of Americans are not married and 4 out of 5 single people consider themselves to be Christians, yet single people struggle with loneliness and can’t find meaningful family in the body of Christ. This leads to depression, suicidality, sex outside of marriage, and hasty marriages. A 2008 study found that single people are more likely to struggle with loneliness, depression, and anxiety, and another study found that loneliness is a bigger health risk than smoking or obesity. In response to this loneliness, 80% of Christian have sex before marriage and over 41% of Christians believe cohabitation is wise. Churches optimized for the vocation of marriage hurt single people because celibates fall through the cracks in between the loose patchwork of nuclear families. Without teaching about the practical and theological beauty of lifetime singleness, celibate Christians don’t know how to think about or walk out their vocation. Many of us are plagued with doubt about whether God exists because we don’t experience a physical embodiment of God’s love in the form of family. A 2017 study found that single people were less likely to rebound from doubt and more likely to lose their faith. All of this makes it difficult for people to commit to celibacy and for celibate people to make spiritual families of their own.



The Need
The Results? Married people suffer.




33% end in divorce
A poor theology and practice of celibacy leads to rushing into marriage, adultery, and divorce.

[Notes]
Married people suffer.
Without a robust theology and practice of lifetime singleness, people rush into marriage, leading to adultery and divorce. 33% of Christian marriages end in divorce—at the same rate as non-Christians. Marriage is perverted from being a beautiful vocation with specific theological and missional purposes for some to being merely a vehicle for guilt-free romance and sex for any Christian who wants to take it. We don’t ask God what His best is for us, and we dive into marriage for the wrong reasons and with the wrong expectations. Without a meaningful minority of Christians committed to lifetime singleness, nuclear families struggle to raise their kids because they don’t have the help of celibate Christians. And because kids grow up seeing marriage as the only option and used in these ways, the pattern of suffering continues.



The Need
The Results? Widows, divorcees, women, and gay Christians suffer.




for every
People on the margins are disproportionately affected.

[Notes]
Widows, divorcees, women, and gay Christians suffer.
These people on the margins are disproportionately affected by our poverty of teaching and support of lifetime singleness. While gay Christians may be most acutely affected by a poor theology and practice of celibacy, women are certainly most numerously affected. A 2018 study found that there are 50% more single women than single men in the Church. Because of the fewer number of faithful men in the Church, many single women involuntarily continue in singleness because the numbers just aren’t there. Widows and divorcees re-enter singleness to find a Church that will not support them.



The Need
The Results? The world suffers.

Our churches are under-tooled to support families, serve the poor, address racial injustice, advocate for immigrants and refugees, or care for the mentally ill.




[Notes]
The world suffers.
In light of the mounting pain and brokenness in the world around us, a powerful minority of Christians wholly committed to advancing the Kingdom through lifetime singleness is needed now more than ever. Our churches are suffering from a famine of lay leadership, our churches need better teaching, nuclear families need more support, wealth inequality has deepened, racial tensions have risen, immigrants and refugees lack advocacy, and our churches struggle to care for those managing mental illness. We suffer from these things, in part, because we do not have enough celibate people who are more available to do this important work of the Church.



The Need
The Results? The gospel suffers.

We lack this unique embodiment of the truth of the gospel: that God is worth giving up everything and can provide more than idols ever could.




[Notes]
The gospel suffers.
All of this tarnishes the good news. Believers struggle to experience the reality of the gospel in this life, and the reflection of God’s love we offer the world is ugly. Without a meaningful minority of Christians thriving in celibacy and doing the work of the Church, we lack a key Sacrament—we lack this unique embodiment of the truth of the gospel. In contrast to the idolatry of romance inside and outside of our churches, lifetime singleness preaches the gospel that God is worth giving up everything and can provide more than the gods of our culture ever could.



The Need
But it doesn’t have to be this way.

We can return to a healthy theology of lifetime singleness and start supporting single people well.




[Notes]
But it doesn’t have to be this way.
The Church can return to a healthy theology of lifetime singleness and start supporting single people again so that they can thrive in their calling for their sake, for the sake of the world, and for the sake of the gospel.

SCRIPTURE


[Notes]
now that we see the need
how do we address it?
as Christian, we don’t want to rush into addressing a need haphazardly
we want to be careful and strategic
and we want to ask, “How does God think about this?”
to do that, we need to start with Scripture—we’re good Protestants aren’t we?




What’s the Bible say?
Genesis 1:27-28, 2:18
Isaiah 56: 3-5
Matthew 19: 1-12
Luke 18: 28-30
Luke 20: 34-36
1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
1 Timothy 5: 5-15




[Notes]
I’ve identified 7 key passage in Scripture related to lifetime singleness
we’ll walk through each of these passage together
pointing out what is self-evident
and where perhaps less clear, I’ve got a couple of theologians
2 are the only Protestants to have approached these topics systematically (why should we value their opinions more?)
Then included Calvin, because no Protestant tradition uninfluenced by Calvin + Luther
and some early Church leaders



What’s the Bible say?
Why are we primarily using theologians who have offered a systematic theology?

Why are we speculating about conclusions from Scripture that aren’t self-evident?




[Notes]
2 early questions you might have

Why are we only using these two theologians who have offered a systematic theology? And why are we spending time even speculating about conclusions from Scripture that aren’t self-evident? These questions are related, so I want to answer them together:



What’s the Bible say?
God, God’s thoughts, and creation are ordered, rational, and coherent.

Our theology must be ordered and consistent with all of Scripture.

Only two Protestant theologians have offered a systematic theology of lifetime singleness.




[Notes]
God made the world in reflection of his perfect orderedness. The way God thinks about both the physical and spiritual things of this world is perfectly rational and cohoerent. And we know that all Scripture is from God and useful for teaching. So any theological conclusions we draw need to fit into a larger system of thought and be consistent with all of Scripture. Interpretations made in isolation of the totality of Scripture aren’t valuable. It would be as if a person only developed their theology of salvation based on reading the Book of James: no one would think that should be authoritative in any way. So we need to look to theologians who have considered all of Scripture on a question and offered a consistent, rational body of thought. Only two Protestant theologians have done that on the topic of lifetime singleness: Max Thurian and Karl Barth.



What’s the Bible say?
Swiss-born Anglican
Co-Founder of Taize Community (France)
Published Marriage and Celibacy in 1955



Max Thurian
(1921-1996)

[Notes]
Max Thurian is a Swiss-born Anglican who lived from 1921 to 1996. He was the co-founder of the Taize community in France, an ecumenical Christian monastic community made of 100+ Protestant and Catholic brothers. One of his most valuable contributions was Marriage and Celibacy, published in 1955. It continues to be the most-cited Protestant systematic theology of celibacy.



What’s the Bible say?
Swiss Reformed Theologian
Top Protestant theologian of the 20th century
Completed Church Dogmatics in 1967, one of largest works of systematic theology ever written—6 million words over 8,000 pages



Karl Barth
(1886 – 1968)

[Notes]
Karl Barth is a Swiss Reformed theologian who lived from 1886 to 1968. He is often regarded as one of the greatest Protestant theologians of the 20th century. He heavily influenced Dietrich Bonhoeffer and supported the Confessing Church in Germany against the Nazis. His massive 13-volume work, Church Dogmatics, is one of the largest works of systematic theology ever written—6 million words over 8,000 pages, completed in 1967 just before his death. Volume 3, Part 4 addresses God’s intentions for human relationship, including marriage and celibacy.

But you still may be wondering: if it’s not self-evident in Scripture, should we just leave it up to the individual to figure it out for themselves? 



What’s the Bible say?
If it’s not self-evident, shouldn’t we just leave it up to the individual?

We are limiting the Bible and failing to lead, giving Christians over to the wisdom of culture.




[Notes]
If we do that, we are settling for only seeing truth through a dirty window. We are limiting our churches to only using a small portion of the Bible. And as leaders, we are failing those we lead by leaving the average Christian without the wisdom they need about practical questions. And then what do they do? Default to what culture is offering. In the absence of your church leading your members in how to think about the practical, real-life questions, they rarely seek those answer for themselves—they need your help.



Genesis 1:27-28, 2:18
So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”
The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”




[Notes]
God establishes the created, natural order for marriage and procreation, and He commands man to marry and procreate 

Then read:

God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.

The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”




Genesis 1:27-28, 2:18
God created man and woman

A central reason for their differentness was marriage and procreation

Adam was made for more than just God




[Notes]
Here we see that God created man and woman
And a central reason for their differentness was that they would marry and procreate
This was the natural, created order
They were commanded to marry and procreate
Another reason was that God saw that when all Adam had was God, he was alone
God created for more than just relationship with God
God made us for relationship with other humans and to co-work with other humans on the projects God has given us



Genesis 1:27-28, 2:18
Rabbinic Judaism considered marriage a moral obligation—to forgo it meant to transgress a commandment of God

“A man who does not concern himself with procreation should be considered to be shedding human blood.” –Talmudic tractate Yebamoth




[Notes]
The Jews were very serious about this commandment to marry and procreate

Rabbinic Judaism consider marriage a moral obligation. He who forgoes marriage and procreation makes himself guilty of transgressing a commandment of God: Gen 1:28
All rabbis married, except for one, Ben Azzai, who had to justify his celibacy
pg 45-46

pg 46
“A man who does not concern himself with procreation should be considered to be shedding human blood.” from the Talmudic tractate Yebamoth, fol. 63b (Goldschmidt, Berlin, 1930-1936, IV, p 536)



Genesis 1:27-28, 2:18
Why was marriage and procreation so important?
God commanded it
The primary way through which God fulfilled his covenants to with Abraham: many descendants, the whole land of Canaan, a great nation, a blessing to the Earth




[Notes]
Why was this so important?
Well God commanded it
But his command was not arbitrary
Marriage and procreation was the primary way through which God fulfilled his covenants with his people
Genesis 12-17, describes God’s covenant with Abraham and his descendants (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(biblical))
God promises Abraham that he will have many descendants, they will will have the whole land of Canaan, they will be a great nation, and they will bless the earth
The people of Israel had to marry and procreate to fulfills these promises
So failing to follow God’s command endangered the blessing of the people of Israel

From this we’ve seen
God establishes the created, natural order for marriage and procreation, and He commands man to marry and procreate 

to better understand the shame that came with not marrying or having offspring
and the anticipation of how Jesus would change that
we need to go to Isaiah 56:3-5



Isaiah 56:3-5
Let no foreigner who is bound to the Lord say, “The Lord will surely exclude me from his people.” And let no eunuch complain, “I am only a dry tree.” For this is what the Lord says: “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant—to them I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will endure forever.




[Notes]
Celibate people are promised a new era when celibacy is lifted up from a curse for a few to an equally good and normal vocation for the average person 

Then read:
Let no foreigner who is bound to the Lord say, “The Lord will surely exclude me from his people.” And let no eunuch complain, “I am only a dry tree.” For this is what the Lord says: “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant—to them I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will endure forever.


the second half of verse 3 refers to the shame of the eunuch
to understand the beauty of these promises, we need to first appreciate the shame of the eunuch



Isaiah 56:3-5
Eunuchs = castrated, celibate men

Why? Pagan religious practices, service in royal court, sex slaves, punishment, humiliation, control

Excluded from worship services under Mosaic Law




[Notes]
Most commonly, eunuchs were men who were castrated, and therefore, sterile and often unable to participate in sexual intercourse. There were many reasons this was done to people: Sometimes people became eunuchs ceremonially so that they could serve in pagan religious practices. Other times people captured in war were forced to become eunuchs so they could serve in the royal court of a foreign nation. People were made eunuchs to be used as sex slaves. And sometimes people were made eunuchs just to punish, humiliate, inflict pain, control, or subjugate.

As a result, eunuchs were excluded from the people of Israel under Mosaic Law. In Deuteronomy 23:1, it was commanded that eunuchs were to be kept from worship services because they were unclean and unworthy to worship God with the people of Israel: if worship is a living sacrifice of our bodies to God, then the worship of a eunuch was unworthy because the sacrifice was physically defective.

examples of the shame of celibacy throughout Scripture
Jeremiah 16:2,9 talk about shame of Jeremiah’s celibacy
Isa 4:1 talks about shame of celibacy
Lot (Gen 19:30-38) or Leah and Rachel (Gen 30:1-13) go to extreme lengths to avoid childlessness
shame and dishonor



Isaiah 56:3-5
”But this is about eunuchs, not celibate people…”

This passage is widely believed to be promises specifically for the eunuch but more generally for celibate people. More in Matthew 19…




[Notes]
now you may push back, “This passage is talking about eunuchs, not celibate people.”
we will address that when we talk about Matthew 19
but just trust me for now that this passage is widely believed to be promises specifically for the eunuch but more generally for celibate people, and these promises are fulfilled in Matthew 19 by the creation of the vocation of celibacy



Isaiah 56:3-5
Isaiah 56 promises family, belonging, and honor:
“within my temple”
“a name better than sons and daughters”
“an everlasting name that will endure forever”




[Notes]
But out of this shame of the eunuch, Isaiah 56 offers hope to the eunuch. In contrast to the exclusion of eunuchs found in Deuteronomy 23:1, Isaiah 56 promises the eunuch family, belonging, and honor: Instead of being excluded from Jewish worship, they will be included “within the walls of my house”. Instead of being forgotten and lost to history because they had no children, they will be remembered in a way greater than “sons and daughters could give”. Instead of being humiliated, they will be honored. Instead of rejected, welcomed. Instead of being exploited, cherished. Instead of being viewed and treated primarily by the nature of their brokenness, they will be named as a child of God because God will call out the image of God found at the core of their person.

Max Thurian
“So even within orthodox Judaism, which excluded eunuchs form the liturgical assemblies, this promise of the messianic future is heard. Those who were considered unfit to be part of the people of God because they were incapable of propagating descendants of Abraham and thus of strengthening the hope of Israel will be welcomed in the Temple and in the City of Yahweh and there they will receive a greater honor than that of children, sons and daughters; on account of the kingdom and their faithfulness to the Lord they will receive the inheritance of eternal life. Here we foresee the necessary change in the theology of marriage which Christ will inaugurate by his life and words."
pg 48

(Karl Barth, pg 157, Isa 56 foretells lifting up of celibacy by Jesus) pg 48
“This allows us to foresee that in the future, when the Child, the Son, the Messiah, is born, a different estimation, a different theory and a different practice of marriage will at least have become possible.”

Celibate people are promised a new era when celibacy is lifted up from a curse for a few to an equally good and normal vocation for the average person 

so let’s get to that new order
this fulfillment by Jesus
this lifting up of both marriage and celibacy as vocations




Turn & Talk
Does the shame of celibacy continue in your church today? Does your church serve families better than singles? Do single people find family in your church? Are single people up front, leading? Who will take care of the single people in your church when they get old?

[Notes]
Ways the shame of the celibate persists today:
Less full part of the church
No family
Cant be a leader
No one to take care of when older
No legacy, no one to pass on name, stories

Matthew 19: 1-12
Verses 1-3: When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?”




[Notes]
In response to the Pharisees and his disciples, Jesus institutes the vocations of marriage and celibacy and he communicates that both vocations are called by God, normative, permanent, and have unique practical and theological purposes 

Then read:

Matthew 19: 1-12
Verses 1-3
The conservative Pharisees are inviting Jesus to side with liberal leaders on the subject of divorce




[Notes]
v.1-3
To understand what’s behind the Pharisees’ question in verse 3 and beyond, we need some background
According to Thurian, there were two schools of thought on the subject of divorce
The school of Hillel that allowed divorced for a spoilt meal or after finding a prettier woman
And the school of Shammai, which this group of Pharisees belonged to, that permitted divorce only in the case of adultery
There question in verse 3 is a trap—an invitation for Jesus to support the more liberal school of Hillel



Max Thurian, pg 25-6
“The moralists of that period were divided into two schools of thought on the subject of divorce. Those belonging to the school of Hillel considered divorce possible on a number of different grounds: a spoilt meal, the finding of a prettier woman, etc. The opponents of this liberal school were the disciples of Shammai, who permitted divorce only in the case of the wife’s misconduct or adultery. The Pharisees who questions Jesus seem to belong to the stricter school of Shammai. The form of their question has the appearance of a trap intended to find our whether Jesus belongs to their school of thought of whether he holds liberal views on morals…On this occasion they cleverly ask Jesus, as if to oblige him to take up a position which they expect ot be that of Hillel, “Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?”




Matthew 19: 1-12
Verses 4-6: “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”




[Notes]
Verses 4-6: “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”




Matthew 19: 1-12
Verses 4-6
Jesus responds by pointing the Pharisees back to God’s original, natural, created order for marriage




[Notes]
Then
v.4-6
In verses 4-6, Jesus responds to their question by pointing the Pharisees back to God’s original, natural, created order for marriage
In this way, Jesus begins the institution of the vocation of marriage that will be completed by Paul in Ephesians 5
What do I mean by that? Jesus not only calls people back to monogamy, but he gives marriage a theological meaning that it did not previously have

Thurian says that “When two persons are united by marriage in God…God enters into that union, he creates it, he founds it upon himself, he insures it against breaking up”
And then in Ephesians 5, Paul makes clear that Christian marriage is a symbol of the unity of Christ and the Church, so, as Thurian says
“If Christians husbands and wives do not live in this love, unity and sacrifice, they make a lie of the symbol which they constitute by marriage…Therefore they cannot separate without making a lie of that symbol and damaging the witness which they should be making to Christ and the Church.”

Jesus is making clear: marriage is indissoluble
Jesus is re-making marriage from merely a command based on the created order to a vocation with higher standards and a higher purpose



“When two persons are united by marriage in God, they then form but a single creature in the eyes of God, and God himself enters into that union with them…God enters into that union, he creates it, he founds it upon himself, he insures it against breaking up…Since they are united in God and by God, Christian husbands and wives cannot break their union without contradicting in practice the work of God which, in spite of everything, remains faithful to itself. The second reason for the indissolubility of marriage is given to us by St Paul. In the Epistle to the Ephesians he exhorts them as follows: ‘Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church’ (Eph 5:25). Then, quoting, like Jesus, the text from Genesis on which he bases the ‘mystery’ of marriage, he writes: ‘For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church’ (Eph. 5:31-2)…Christian marriage is a symbol of the unity of Christ and the Church, of their love and mutual sacrifice; so it should always be growing more concretely and visibly into what it really is in its depths…If Christians husbands and wives do not live in this love, unity and sacrifice, they make a lie of the symbol which they constitute by marriage…Therefore they cannot separate without making a lie of that symbol and damaging the witness which they should be making to Christ and the Church."
God unites and participates in that unification
God makes it and ensures it will not break
therefore indissouable
plus christian marriage is a symbol of trinity and Crhsit+Church, so dissoultion would falsely communicate unfaithfullness of God





Matthew 19: 1-12
Verses 7-9: “Why then,” they asked, “did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?” Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”

Jesus rejected the School of Shammai
Neither Mark nor Luke include it
Romans 7:2-3 and 1 Corinthians 7:10-11 & 39 affirm the indissolubility of marriage unconditionally
Matthew 5:32 communicates that if you marry someone who has been divorced, you commit adultery, without any exception






[Notes]
the Pharisees ask Jesus a followup question inviting him to take their side: the school of Shammai
but he rejects even that, saying that Moses gave them over to their broken desires
that divorce was not God’s created intention
He says that anyone who divorces his wife and marries another is committing adultery
But there’s this exception clause in Matthew that isn’t found in the other gospels
We won’t spend too much time here
But there’s good reason to believe that Jesus didn’t mean that sexual immorality was grounds for divorce, but instead allowed for a separation without remarriage
Here’s why

(1)
Thurian says that if Jesus was allowing divorce on the grounds of adultery, he would be siding with the Pharisees. And that would contradict his reference to Genesis about the indissolubility of marriage. And his disciples’ reaction, which we will get to in a second, is one of shock. They would not have been surprised if they understood Jesus to be siding with the Pharisees. But they would be shocked if Jesus was going even further than the Pharisees.

“If the Matthaenan traditional allowed this exception to the indissolubility of marriage, we should have to admit that Jesus let himself become a supporter of the school of Shammai which permitted divorce only for misconduct. Jesus would seem to contradict himself; since he placed himself about the rival schools of Hillel and Shammai in reverting to the point of view of Genesis (‘one flesh’), it would be strange if he should take sides on the matter, even the stricter side. Besides, the disciples ingenuous reaction, which we shall study later…shows that they understood Jesus’ teaching in an absolute sense and not just in Shammai’s sense, which would not have astonished them.” pg 26
If exception allows for divorce in case of adultery, he would be supporting the school of Shammai
first, this would contradict he reference of Genesis and the indissoubility of marriage
but disciples reactions suggest they understood he was not supporting Shammai but instead making a more absolute statement
they would have been comfortable with Shammai and seen it as reasonable and normal

(2)
neither Mark or Luke include exception

(3)
Rom 7:2-3, 1 Cor 7:39, and 1 Cor 7:10-11 seem to affirm the indissolubility of marriage quite unconditionally

(4)
Matt 5:32 says that if you marry someone who has been divorced, you commit adultery, without any exception
seems to confirm that marriage is indissoluble

So if this isn’t talking about grounds for divorce, what is it talking about?
Consistent explanation is that you can separate if there is adultery
But you cannot marry another
Because you are still married in the eyes of God



“From these different passages we can extract the following doctrine: marriage is indissoluble; whoever puts away his wife puts her in danger of becoming an adulteress and becomes guilty of her adultery; if he marries another women he commits adultery; in the case of the wife’s misconduct, the husband is not putting her in danger of adultery by putting her away, and is not the be held guilty of it, since the adultery has already been committed; but neither he nor the divorced wife may remarry without committing adultery.” pg 28




Matthew 19: 1-12
Verse 9: False marriage?
1 Corinthians 5:1, Acts 15:20, and Acts 15:29 address false marriages, in which cases, you can marry someone else because you were never joined by God
Could translate instead as “except in the case of concubinage” or “except in the case of false marriage”




[Notes]
Another theory is that these exception clauses referred to false marriages
Marriage entered into under false pretenses
A marriage never consummated
Or marriage to a concubine
this seems to be what 1 Cor 5:1, Acts 15:20, Acts 15:29 are talking about, and in those cases you can marry someone else because you were never truly married in the eyes of God

According to Benoit, Bonsirven, and Berrouard, One could translate the exception clause as “except in the case of concubinage” or “except in the case of a false marriage"

P. Benoit, La sainte Bible de Jerusalem, 'L’Evangile selon saint Matthieu’, Le Cerf, Paris, 1950, pp.114,55
J. Bonsirven, Le divorce dans le Nouveau Testament, Paris, 1928
M. F. Berrouard, “L’indissolubilite du mariage dans le Nouveau Testament’, Lumiere et Vie, No. 4, 1952, p.26

regardless, we need to understand how high the standard was so that we appreciate what comes next



Matthew 19: 1-12
Verse 10: The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.”




[Notes]
Verse 10: The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.”




Matthew 19: 1-12
Verse 10
The disciples jokingly suggest that it would be better to stay single. Why?
Celibacy was not good or normal for the average Jew.
“If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better for us to cut off our genitals.”




[Notes]
verses 10, 11, and 12 are the most important verses in the Bible when it comes to the vocation of celibacy
the disciples are surprised by Jesus’ high standard for divorce, and they communicate that by jokingly suggesting that if that is the teaching, it would be better to stay single
why is this a joke?
well remember what we said about eunuchs and celibacy
The Jewish people were commanded to marry and procreate. Because the multiplication of God’s people was the primary way through which God fulfilled his covenants to his people, celibacy was not good or normal for the average Jew. So to suggest it would be good or normal for a Jew not to marry was laughable.
We miss this without a proper understanding of how the disciples would have heard Jesus’ teachings
to get the full effect with modern ears, perhaps you could rewrite the verse to say, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better for us to cut off our genitals.”
it’s meant to be ridiculous and facetious



Matt 19: 8-10, pg 35 (apostles amazed by Jesus’ standard, return to created order, divorce)
“The apostles, accustomed, at most, to the relative strictness of Shammai, who permitted divorce for misconduct, and remarriage, are amazed at the absolute nature of the indissolubility of marriage. Marriage seems to them to require a vow which is onerous because of its irrevocability. Marriage was made easier by the ordinances of Moses which allowed for ‘the hardness of man’s heart’ and permitted divorce, and by the moral schools of Hillel and Shammai which interpreted these ordinances…Jesus’ position, founded on the original order of creation, concerning the indissolubility of the marital union and the remarriage of divorced persons, makes marriage a permanent and exclusive undertaking, a sort of lifelong vow. A man may not divorce his wife; he may finally separate from her because of adultery, but he may not remarry during her lifetime.”



Matthew 19: 1-12
Verses 11-12: Jesus replied, “Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”




[Notes]
Verses 11-12: Jesus replied, “Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”




Matthew 19: 1-12
Verses 11-12
Jesus’ response shocks them: He told a crowd of Jewish people who were commanded to marry and procreate that they should consider celibacy.




[Notes]
it’s important to understand what verse 10 means for verses 11 and 12 to really sink in
in contrast to the disciples statement
Jesus shocks them
here’s my paraphrase: Jesus says, “Yeah, actually, some of you have been called to celibacy, and it would be better for you not to marry.”
This is radical. He told a crowd Jewish people who were commanded to marry and procreate to consider celibacy.



Matthew 19: 1-12
Verses 11-12
Jesus institutes the vocation of celibacy
A vocation that is given/called
A vocation with practical and theological purposes
A vocation that is permanent




[Notes]
there’s a lot going on in verses 11 and 12
Jesus is instituting a vocation of celibacy
it is a vocation in response to a calling and a gift
it is a vocation with both practical and theological purposes
and it is a permanent vocation



Matthew 19: 1-12
1. Jesus institutes the vocation of celibacy
His life of celibacy is the foundation
His words begin instituting the vocation of celibacy and made it common/normative
His death and resurrection completed the creation of the vocation
His life, words, and resurrection fulfill the promises to the eunuch





[Notes]
Wish the bible was a textbook or Jesus set up a press conf
it would make clearer to us that this is an important theological moment
this is about as close as we get
He just began instituting the vocation of marriage by calling God’s people out of our broken natural state to our redeemed state and giving theological purpose to marriage
And now he will do the same with celibacy
To the audience's shock
Here’s how he does it:
Jesus’ life of celibacy is the foundation
Jesus’ words begin instituting the vocation of celibacy and made it common/normative
Jesus’ death and resurrection complete the creation of the vocation
And by that he fulfills the promises to the eunuch

let’s dive into some of those claims



Matthew 19: 1-12
1. Jesus institutes the vocation of celibacy
A. His life of celibacy is the foundation




[Notes]
Jesus’ life of celibacy is the foundation
Jesus himself was celibate. He did not marry or have sex or have children. He was not romantic with anyone. So without saying a word, Jesus is challenging the commandment for all to marry and procreate and hinting at a new order. It’s not an accident that Jesus was celibate. God specifically chose this, in part, to usher in the new vocation of celibacy


pg 49
“Christ did not experience marriage, physical love and sexual union. His life is therefore the valid foundation of the vocation of celibacy in the new ear…He does not abolish the order of creation, the laws of nature and the law of Moses; he fulfills them all, giving back to these primitive systems their original profound meaning.”



Matthew 19: 1-12
1. Jesus institutes the vocation of celibacy
B. His words begin instituting the vocation of celibacy and made it common/normative

Jesus lifted up celibacy from being an exceptional vocation for only a few to an equally normative calling for the average Christian.




[Notes]
Jesus’ words begin instituting the vocation of celibacy and made it common/normative

Remember how the Jewish people were commanded to marry and procreate? So to suggest it would be good or normal for a Jew not to marry was laughable? How does he respond to the disciple’s joking, facetious suggestion? He told a crowd Jewish people who were commanded to marry and procreate to consider celibacy.
That’s a huge deal. Jesus is instituting a new vocation, to stand next to marriage as an equal. Jesus placed the vocation of celibacy on equal footing.
Jesus lifted up celibacy from being an exceptional vocation for only a few to an equally normative calling for the average Christian.

In response to Matthew 19:11-12 and Christ’s institution of the vocation of celibacy, Karl Barth shares a warning for Protestants: “In repudiating this way of celibacy, or allowing it only as an exception, would not one be falling back wrongly into a conception peculiar to the Old Testament?”
He is warning that if we discourage celibacy, fail to offer it full-throatedly to the average Christian, or dismiss it an an exceptional, abnormal calling—as Calvin and Luther did–we are disregarding Christ’s words here.



Thurian pg 51 (celibacy is a fully human and Christian experience because Jesus did it)
“To remain celibate for the kingdom of heaven’s sake is not to be less human, but to know life; in giving up one form of human existence the Christian finds fulness of life. Christ was no less human because he had no other love than that of his brothers and no other bride than the Church.”

goes further about being normative
(Barth, 160, equally normative and should be common) pg 52
“Is it surprising that among Jesus’ circle, in the early Church, and later as well, there were men, it seems, who thought it good to avail themselves of this other possibility [i.e. of the second vocation, which is celibacy]; men for whom entry into the Church and life within it obviously replaced entry into the marital union and married life? They did this, not in opposition to marriage understood in the sense of Eph 5:31—marriage which had been given a new value—but rather in consequence of this new valuation of marriage, in direct connection with the example given by Jesus himself. In repudiating this way of celibacy, or allowing it only as an exception, would not one be falling back wrongly into a conception peculiar to the Old Testament?”



Matthew 19: 1-12
1.Jesus institutes the vocation of celibacy
C. His death and resurrection completed the creation of the vocation

Christ’s death establishes a new covenant where marriage was no longer necessary to fulfill God’s promises because we join God’s family by Christ’s work on the cross.




[Notes]
Jesus’ death and resurrection complete the creation of the vocation
But how can he do that? Just ignore the commandment to marry and procreate?
In John 1:13 and John 3:5-7 Jesus foreshadows a new covenant where you do not belong to Israel according to the flesh but become a child of God through new birth
Colossians 1: 6 and 10 confirm that the fruit we are commanded to bear in light of Christ’s resurrection is not physical children but spiritual children
Hebrews 8 reflects that Christ’s death establishes a new covenant where marriage was no longer necessary to fulfill God’s promises because we join God’s family by Christ’s work on the cross, not birth into a Jewish family. So the commandment for all to marry and procreate has been fulfilled. Marriage and procreation are still good, but they are no longer commanded for all.
So it’s not just Jesus’ words, but his death and resurrection that establish the new covenant that institute this new vocation: that make it possible.

This is why we can’t get stuck in Old Testament ways of thinking about marriage or celibacy
Jesus completely transforms both
In the Garden, created order, perfect, but not complete
then broken by the fall
romance, sex, and polygamy are natural
faithful monogamy and celibacy are unnatural
then Jesus institutes the vocations of marriage and celibacy
giving both theological meaning they didn’t previously have—both being images of the Trinity and Christ+Church
calling back to monogamy
lifting up celibacy




Matthew 19: 1-12
1. Jesus institutes the vocation of celibacy
D. His life, words, and resurrection fulfill the promises to the eunuch

Isaiah 56:3-5 promises eunuchs, a people who will have no spouse or biological offspring and whose lot was seen as a curse by the Jewish people, that if they fully commit themselves to the work of God, God will give them greater honor, family, and legacy than any offspring could provide. 




[Notes]
And by that he fulfills the promises to the eunuch

While Jesus is talking about a vocation of lifetime singleness, he compares the celibate to the eunuch. We’ll get more into what that means for the vocation of celibacy, but at the very least, it connects whatever is going on here with singleness to eunuchs in some way.
But, it’s hard not to read this passage as Jesus speaking to the eunuch and saying, “In this way, I have fulfilled my promises in Isaiah 56.” Isaiah 56:3-5 promises eunuchs, a people who will have no spouse or biological offspring and whose lot was seen as a curse by the Jewish people, that if they fully commit themselves to the work of God, God will give them greater honor, family, and legacy than any offspring could provide. And in Matthew 19:3-12, Jesus is promising celibate Christians, a people who will have no spouse or biological offspring and whose lot was seen as a curse by the Jewish people, that if they fully commit themselves to the work of God, God will give them deeper family and greater kingdom purpose.



Matthew 19: 1-12
2. The vocations of marriage and celibacy are called/given

Verse 11 – An ability to accept Jesus’ teachings about marriage and follow them is given to those who are called to marriage

Verse 12 – An ability to accept Jesus’ teachings about celibacy and follow them is given to those who are called to celibacy




[Notes]
In verse 11, in response to the disciples shock about his high standard for marriage, Jesus says that only those to whom the calling of marriage has been given will accept his teachings about marriage
And then in verse 12, Jesus says that only those to whom the calling of celibacy has been given will accept his teachings about celibacy

Both Barth and Thurian believe Jesus is instituting the vocations of marriage and celibacy in this passage, and he is clearly communicating that our vocation is called, not chosen

Karl Barth p 158-9 Church Dogmatics (pg 41-42), two vocations
“But now, from this moment, marriage is just one possibility which one may choose, one way that can be taken…Precisely because marriage is no longer an obligation in the Church of the New Testament period, the unmarried state is not a subject for shame or grief. On the contrary—and this is the other, positive aspect—when marriage received this new meaning and consecration, then it also became possible to understand and to value the renunciation of marriage as a possibility, a way, a matter of a particular gift and call.”

Even Calvin recognizes that this gift is given, and anyone could receive that gift
Calvin commentary on Matt 19:11, vol 1, pp 389-90     pg 57
“Christ shows that not all have the liberty to choose as they think fit, for the gift of continence is a special gift…Hence this way of making oneself a eunuch does not depend on the will of a man, but the plain meaning is that there are certain people naturally capable of marrying who, nevertheless, by abstaining from marriage do not tempt God, because he allows them to do without it and grants them a privilege above others.”
not chosen but given
everyone has innate capacity to do marriage well
God give portion to do celibacy well

Barth, too, says that we are not predisposed, by nature, to either marriage or celibacy



Karl Barth p 205 marriage not only natural vocation, Matt 19, pg 58
“One marries, one enters into the state of marriage because one has realized that this is the particular will of God in one’s case, and for this reason one has the right and duty to do so. Therefore one was also ready to realize that the will of God could have been different. It is by realizing that the will of God for oneself was not celibacy that one was led to undertake marriage. So one is free; but one is not free with respect to that permission and obligation by nature, by birth, by any normal means, by one’s own initiative; one is made free by vocation, the gift and the grace of God.”
God calls us to marriage or celibacy
it is our duty to say yes
no natural predisposition for one or the other
and our preference does not matter




Matthew 19: 1-12
2. The vocations of marriage and celibacy are called/given…but are they natural?

Romance, sex, and polygamy are natural. We each have the same inherent capacity for marriage and celibacy, but an incomplete capacity.




[Notes]
This brings up the question of what is natural? Only marriage? Marriage and celibacy? Neither? Does the average Christian automatically possess everything they need to thrive in celibacy? No. But the same is true of marriage. We don’t have what we need to do marriage well either. In light of the fall, romance, sex, and polygamy are natural. That’s why Jesus creates the vocations of celibacy and marriage—to call people back to the order in the Garden and the order that will be in the NHNE.

(Thurian, marriage is unnatural)
pg 43
“Free marriage or polygamy is indeed part of the natural order; but marriage as ordained by Christ, who re-establishes in a world of sin the marital order existing before the Fall, demands a vocation, obedience, and sacrifice.”
“Only those who understand the saying of Christ who realize the demands and who feel called to it should respond to this vocation of Christian marriage which is exclusive and indissoluble.”
Thurian affirms this, and he has strong words for what happens when we mistakenly think marriage is the only natural vocation (next page)




Matthew 19: 1-12
“…When the call to celibacy is too little heard, marriage gradually come to be thought of as a reality of the purely natural order…When the vocation of celibacy is undervalued, so is that of marriage…”




[Notes]
(Thurian, balance between marriage and celibacy, consequences for low view of celibacy) pg 44
Both bring difficulties, renunciations and sacrifices, as well as blessings and joys. When the call to celibacy is too little heard, marriage gradually come to be thought of as a reality of the purely natural order. ‘Every man, every Christian, ought to be married, and if he is not, it is by accident or through selfishness!’ When the vocation of celibacy is undervalued, so is that of marriage, When there is only one natural way to open to men, one cannot speak of vocation. For there to be a vocation, there must be the possibility of a choice between at least two ways. In order that Christian marriage may be considered as a holy vocation and not just as a reality in the natural order to be blessed and sanctified, the call to religious celibacy for the kingdom of heaven’s sake must be sounded”

Basically saying that there can’t only be one vocation. There either a default for all, or at least 2 vocations

the word “chosen” has been used a couple of times, but also called and given
those seem contradictory
let’s break that down
voluntary, chosen eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven
don’t let these words fool you
this doesn’t mean that all that matters is our preference
that we only have to be celibate or single if we want to
clear that God has a call for us
and that we should obey God’s call
but God wishes for our preference to be conformed to God’s preference
and for no one to be forced into celibacy before their will has aligned with God’s, just as no one should be forced into marriage without being called to it and recognizing that call
this should be a clear admonishment of mandatory priestly celibacy




Matthew 19: 1-12
3. The practical and theological purposes of the vocation of celibacy

Practical: to fully commit oneself to kingdom work

Theological: the creation of the vocation of celibacy creates the space for marriage to change from being ordinary to being for a specific theological purpose




[Notes]
On screen



Jesus describes the practical purposes of the vocation of celibacy

Matt 19 for the kingdom’s sake, practical purposes, pg 107
“It is this that Christ meant when he founded the state of voluntary celibacy ‘for the kingdom of heaven’s sake’…Like Jesus, the Christian celibate can commit the whole of himself spiritually and humanly to the ministry. He is not celibate in order to achieve greater tranquility, but in order to be like Christ in his work for the kingdom. If he means to live truly in his way of life, all his strength and all his cares should be directed towards a living proclamation of the Gospel in order to hasten the return of Christ. He should be ready to respond to the calls of the Church and of his community with obedience and availability.”
wholly committed to kingdom work

Jesus describes the theological purposes of the vocation of celibacy

(…, Thurian, discernment, equal states, theological purposes)
“Similarly, the existence of the state of celibacy and the state of marriage side by side in the Church sets forth the dialogue which is essential for the prophesying of the kingdom. If the celibate life is not available as a possible choice for the servants of God, then marriage becomes the normal and ordinary life for all. But in the new order fo the kingdom nothing is normal or ordinary any longer. The secularization of marriage is a result of our having forgotten that a choice between two possible courses is open to the Christian before he makes his decision.”



Matthew 19: 1-12
4. The vocation of celibacy is permanent

Jesus describes the celibate as a “eunuch for the sake of the kingdom” to communicate its permanence




[Notes]
Jesus comparing the celibate for the sake of the kingdom to a eunuch is not an accident. It’s meaningful: being a eunuch is permanent and irrevocable—you can’t undo genital mutilation. So too, the vocation of celibacy should be permanent.

Matt 19, permanent and free state, pg 55
“Does not the mention by Jesus of the first two classes of eunuchs (by birth and by accident) indicate that he means to speak of a permanent state when he institutes voluntary celibacy?…However if Christ uses the word eunuch even for that class of Christians, there must be a reason for it. And what other reason can there be to justify Jesus’ use of the same word to describe eunuchs by birth or accident and celibates for the sake of the kingdom than that he wishes to point out the permanent nature of that state?”

St. Athenagoras from 177 AD and Thurian agree here, closing his argument with this:
Matt 19, permanent, pg 55-56
“We cannot otherwise understand why the Lord should see fit to scandalize the Jews and shock them by a word which revolted them and which had the literal meaning of a condition incompatible with membership of the people of Israel or of the liturgical assembly.”

Barth agrees as well, stating that accepting the call to celibacy not only involves the temporary abstention from romance and sex but a permanent forbiddance from marrying

Karl Barth pg 160, permanence, speaking on Matthew 19, pg 56
“This is not a prohibition or discrimination, but rather a precise delimitation and relativization of marriage. Nor is there a particular institutional implication of the status of a celibate in these words; instead they define actual decisions to celibacy. Above all, there is no question of celibates having a higher status, but it is clearly stated that there are special circumstances which make such decisions possible or indispensable. The result is not only that marriage is not commanded to certain men, but also that it is forbidden to them temporarily or permanently. In the light of these words, we cannot assert on the other hand that marriage is generally and for each person the highest way and the best solution. They simply imply that the new era can now impel man to remain celibate in order to witness in this way to the relationship which exists between Christ and his Church.”
Decision of celibacy leading to marriage being forbidden permanently

Matt 19:12, celibacy permanent, pg 94
“When Christs speaks of voluntary celibates for the kingdom of heaven’s sake, he uses imagery which leaves us in no doubt about the character of absolute and permanent renunciation of all possibility of marriage. The voluntary celibates for the kingdom of heaven’s sake are compared with those who must of necessity remain unmarried.”

(St. Athenagoras, AD 177, celibacy is voluntary, permanent, and beautiful) pg 53
“There are to be found among us many men and women who have grown old without marrying, in the hope of belonging more completely to God. If perseverance in virginity and voluntary celibacy brings us near to God, and if the mere thought, the mere desire of pleasure take us away from him, how much more should we avoid the acts from whose very thought we flee.”
MANY!
and word for voluntary celibacy is greek word that communicates an absolute and permanent state

Now some might balk at the permanence of celibacy, saying that limits God. But Thurian has a convincing response. 
(Thurian, permanent vow of celibacy)
pg 36
combatting idea that permanent vow of celibacy limits God
“A permanent pledge of poverty, chastity, and obedience seems to the ordinary Protestant to be interference with the liberty of the Holy Spirit. Let us say at once that it is the permanent pledge of celibacy which raises the most questions, together with the lifelong membership of a particular spiritual family, a single community. ‘Suppose you are unable to persevere in celibacy?’ one is asked. Or again, ‘Suppose God guides you to marry, or calls you to a quite different field of service which necessitates your leaving the community?’ The answer to these questions will be left until later, but they are mentioned here to show that they can be turned against marriage and the lifelong vow which it involves. Although Reformed thinking calls in question lifelong monastic vows or permanent commitment to a community, it generally admits the irrevocability of Christian marriage, with an exception in the case of adultery, which for some authorizes separation without remarriage, and for many, divorce and remarriage. It occurs to nobody to think that our belief in the liberty of God is harmed by this permanent marriage vow. Let us ask the above questions again, referring them to marriage. ‘Suppose the woman you have married loses the charm that first made you choose her and love her; suppose you fall in love with another woman; suppose your wife’s mental condition necessitates a certain continence; suppose your wife is afflicted with neurasthenia or madness; will you break the marriage bond which binds you to your wife for better for worse, in sickness and in health?’ Or again, ‘Suppose God calls you to a task which will take you to tropical countries or wretched living conditions which your wife’s health cannot stand, will you break with her?’ Any Christian would reply ’No’ to both these questions, The permanent marriage vow unconditionally excludes divorce for any reason, except a temporary or permanent separation without remarriage, it obliges the partners always to plan together so that any step may be taken by both of them together. Marriage may then be considered a handicap, but it is a handicap willed by God, an irrevocable vow and vocation. The marriage vow does not contradict God’s liberty, it merely limits man’s freedom. The Holy Spirit has no need of our freedom to blow where he listen.”

If we can accept that marriage is permanent and irrevocable, we should be able to accept the permanence and irrevocability of celibacy

In response to the Pharisees and his disciples, Jesus institutes the vocations of marriage and celibacy and he communicates that both vocations are called by God, normative, permanent, and have unique practical and theological purposes 



Turn & Talk
Does the average teen in your church believe lifetime singleness would be a beautiful path? Do they open-handedly offer the question of whether they will pursue marriage or celibacy to God? What are the consequences of not doing this?



1:30

[Notes]
A key teaching of Jesus is Matthew 19:1-12 is that we are called to either celibacy or marriage. Our vocation is given. We do not choose. Our preference does not matter. Instead we should submit the question of marriage or celibacy to God and receive whichever He has given to us. When you think about the average teen in your church…

Assume marriage
Take it for the wrong reasons
Or can’t accept singleness and feel cheated
Marriages failing
And no one doing celibacy well and maximizing the work of the church



Luke 18: 28-30
Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!” “Truly I tell you,” Jesus said to them, “no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.”




[Notes]
Jesus promises an 100-fold blessing of family and blessing in this life and the life to come to those who commit permanently to celibacy 

Then read:
Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!” “Truly I tell you,” Jesus said to them, “no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.”




Luke 18: 28-30
Those who accept the call to celibacy will receive 100-fold family and blessing in this life and the life to come.

That blessing is permanent.

It is still a call to family.




[Notes]
Jesus offering a general promise to his disciples, but this passage is understood to be part of this collection of specific promises to the celibate. Jesus is continuing to institute the vocation of celibacy by promising that those who give up a spouse and children (not abandon, but give up the prospect), will receive 100-fold family and blessing and honor in this life and the life to come.

Thurian believes this also confirms the permanent nature of the vocation of celibacy. It is irrevocable. He argues that this can’t possibly refer to blessing for temporary singleness:

Luke 18:28-30, pg 95-96
“The same permanent and absolute pledge is implied in the more general promise of Christ, which is found with some variants, in the three synoptic Gospels…Christ has revealed in this promise that the man who gives up marital or family life for him and for the ministry (for my sake and the Gospel’s) can be assured of finding in another form the fatherhood which he has not experienced in the flesh. He shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, and in the world to come eternal life. The direction of this promise, first mentioning the hundredfold received in this world, then passing at once to the gift of eternal life in the world to come, shows very clearly the absolute, permanent and continuous character of the commitment which this promise requires. We cannot imagine that, in the mind of Jesus, such blessings would be promised to Christians who would accept only a temporary renunciation of marriage, a family and property…Can we imagine the action of a Christian who, wishing to benefit by the promises here expressed by Jesus, gives up marriage for a time and receives the hundredfold blessing, then gives up his state of celibacy in order to found a family? Would not this be an abuse of Jesus’ promise, which is addressed only to those who have really and permanently left all, in order to receive an hundredfold now in this time and in the world to come eternal life?”
hundredfold promise suggests a permanent renunciation of romance and marriage
Related to this passage is also the promise of 100-fold family
Lifetime singleness is not a call to loneliness
It is still a call to intimacy in the context of family

Luke 18:28-30, still made for family, pg 111
“If the renunciation of marriage and the family causes loneliness with regard to human intimacy, the Christian celibate should remember that there is a promise corresponding to his pledge. He received a hundredfold brothers, sisters, and children now in this present time…It is still true for the Christian celibate that it is not good that man should be alone (Gen 2:18). But in the new order of the kingdom of God established by Christ, marriage is not the only way of avoiding that wrong and dangerous loneliness. Man can no longer consider himself to be alone when he is in the Church and in the communion of saints, for he is the friend of the Bridegroom and he can make friends for himself by mercy and charity. He is a member of the Body of Christ, and all the members of that Body are bound to each other in the most indissoluble unity.”

Thurian, pg 119, still a call to family
“This physical, mental, and spiritual discipline of the Christian celibate will be even more profitable for keeping him in the truth of his vocation if he is not alone in submitting to it, but is supported, directed and carried along by a community, the best safeguard of his joy in the ministry.”
Thurian goes even further to explain the need for monastic communities:
Thurian, pg 120, still a call to family
“One can, of course, imagine the vocation of a Christian celibate finding its fulfillment within the parish, in the Church as a local community. However, his solitude in a parish composed of couples and families runs the risk of giving him the impression of being in a difficult and sometimes painful situation. So it is quite natural that the majority of Christian celibates will be led to form themselves into regular community, not by any necessity on the theological level, but by a need of the spiritual life. Such a community, a spiritual family obeying a rule, will enable Christian celibates to support and to stimulate one another in the joy and fervor of their ministry.”

Jesus promises an 100-fold blessing of family and blessing in this life and the life to come to those who commit permanently to celibacy 



Luke 20: 34-36
Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.




[Notes]
All of us will be celibate in the New Heaven and New Earth. One of the theological purposes of celibacy is to foreshadow the next life and give the Church hope 

Then read:
Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.




Luke 20: 34-36
All of us will be celibate in the New Heaven and New Earth. The vocation of celibacy is a foreshadowing of the next life and should give the Church hope.




[Notes]
Jesus is letting us know that in the next life, there will be no marriage, sex, or child-bearing. This is meaningful because Jesus is promising that in the NHNE, all of us will be celibate. That gives the vocation of celibacy today special theological meaning, because it is a foreshadowing, a first fruits of the NHNE and, when done well, should be a hope for all of us.

All of us will be celibate in the New Heaven and New Earth. One of the theological purposes of celibacy is to foreshadow the next life and give the Church hope 



Thurian, pg 112-3, theological purpose
“Voluntary celibacy for the kingdom of heaven’s sake is the sign of a new order where marriage is no longer, as in the Old Testament, a necessity for ensuring a holy posterity to Abraham…The eschatological sense, the certainty of being in the last act of history, and the expectation of Christ’s return lead the Christian not to become too attached to the realities of his human life…the celibate is a sign of the detachment required by the expectation of the kingdom of God.”

Luke 20:34-36, theological purpose, pg 114
“The Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, asked Jesus which of a woman’s seven successive husbands would have her as wife in the future life. To this ridiculous question Jesus replied..Celibacy is a sign of the resurrection and of the coming kingdom of God, because at the resurrection and in the kingdom there is neither marriage nor giving in marriage. In the Church celibacy is thus a reminder of the new order of the Gospel…”



1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Responding to 3 groups of people:
People thriving in vowed celibacy because they are called to it
False ascetics who believed sex was bad, leading to sexless marriages
Wild libertines who were living sexually immoral lives





[Notes]
Paul confirms the teachings of Jesus: there are two vocations, they are called by God, and they are permanent. Paul communicates his preference for celibacy, praises early forms of vowed, permanent celibacy, and describes the practical purposes of celibacy: freedom from raising children to do more demanding kingdom work 

Before we jump into 1 Cor 7, I need to give you some backgroundthe challenge of 1 Cor 7 is that it is
responding to the situation in Corinth and often quotes from letters from the church
It is hard to know when he is responding to what without the letter from Corinth to Paul
and no signs of when Paul is quoting others versus expressing his own opinion

Thurian explains that there are 3 groups of people in the Church in Corinth that Paul is speaking to
The first is a group of people thriving in vowed celibacy because they are called to it (praises and recommends 7, 8, 25-35, 39-40; spiritual betrothals 36-38)
The other two were groups of people misled by a false theology that our bodies will not be resurrected
One group applied that to mean that our bodies were evil, particularly sex, so even married people should abstain from sex (3-5)
And another group use that as grounds to say, well if my body doesn’t matter, let’s have a free-for-all (9, elsewhere in Corinthians)



1 Cor 7, Max Thurian, pg 65, background
“So it is in this context of exhortation against false asceticism or wild libertinism that St Paul’s teachings on marriage and celibacy must be understood. Since they do not believe that the body will rise and therefore share in the redemption, some allow themselves everything (‘All things are lawful unto me’, 1 Cor 6:12) and fall into impurity, lasciviousness, incest and adultery; others deprive themselves of everything and renounce sexual intercourse in marriage, practice spiritual betrothal, or remain celibate and glorify virginity.”

pg 66, background
“St Paul addresses exhortations to them, to remind both groups that since the body is called to the resurrection it is neither despicable nor indifferent, and that exclusive, indissoluble Christian marriage is the only means of avoiding impurity for those who are not called to celibacy.”



1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 1-6: Now for the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. I say this as a concession, not as a command.

1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 1-6
Paul calls married Christians to monogamy and healthy marital relations




[Notes]
In verses 1-6, Paul calls married Christians to monogamy and healthy marital relations

Thurian points out that verse 1 is likely a quote from a letter from the Church in Corinth, so while Paul does not reject the sentiment, we shouldn’t fully attribute that to him. Thurian also points out that in verse 2, Paul is not saying that every person should marry. He is following Jesus’ example by calling the sexually immoral Corinthians back to monogamy: that if you are married, you should have only one wife. And Paul is encouraging sexless marriages to reject the false theology that sex is bad and resume healthy martial relations.

pg 68, 1 Cor 7:1-2, Thurian
“In this way we are not dealing with St Paul’s own opinion, but with the Corinthians’ opinion which the apostle, without denying it categorically, corrects by defining the rights and duties of Christian marriage. The ‘spiritual’ Corinthians, without a vocation of celibacy, are in danger of impurity; therefore every man should have his own wife and every woman her own husband, and husband and wife must fully accept their marriage.
When St Paul exhorts every man to have his own wife and every woman her own husband, he does not mean that all men should be married. Every man should have one wife, his own wife, and every woman one husband, her own husband. He is calling them back to Christian monogamy.”
does not reject vocational permanent celibacy
but makes clear that those not called to that should marry
and calling people back to monogamy

1 Cor 7:3-6
Paul gives concession but not command for marriages to practice continence for a time of retreat, prayer, and asceticism

Thurian clarifies that in verse 5, Paul is not encouraging the unmarried man to marry in order to remedy his temptation, but instead is encouraging married people not to abstain from marital relations for too long because Satan might exploit that.



1 Cor 7:1-6, pg 91
“It should be noted that the apostle is not, in fact, addressing unmarried men to whom he recommends marriage as an escape from incontinence…They said that it is good for a man not to touch a woman; in other words, God is pleased when a married man refrains from intercourse with his wife. And the apostle replies that every man has his own vocation and that there are Christians who are called to celibacy, but that every married man should fulfill his duty to his wife, and similarly the wife to her husband, to avoid the risk of unchastity. The apostle is not thinking of every man and woman when he exhorts each to have ‘his own wife’ or ‘her own husband’. This would, in fact, be too obvious a contradiction with the recommendation in favour of celibacy which he afterwards makes. He simply means that for married people there is a danger of impurity or misconduct in abstaining for one another, ‘except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to prayer.’”
not saying marriage is solution for single unchastity
saying sex in marriage solution for marital unchastity
but single people should stay single if they are called



1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 7-8: I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do.




[Notes]
Verses 7-8: I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do.




1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 7-8
Paul confirms that there are two vocations, God calls/gives our vocation, and communicates his preference for celibacy




[Notes]
Verse 7 makes clear that there are 2 gifts, marriage and celibacy, and they are given by God
And in both verses 7 and 8, Paul communicates his preference for celibacy

1 Cor 7:7, pg 68-69
“It is, therefore, a good thing, normal, profitable and happy for a Christian to remain celibate if he has a vocation for it, just as in Genesis, on the contrary, it is not good, normal, profitable or happy for man to be alone. Is there a contradiction here? No, the apostle is observing the difference between the order of creation and nature in which marriage alone is good, and the order of redemption and the kingdom in which celibacy, as well as marriage, is a good, normal, profitable and happy state for man…Jesus Christ instituted voluntary celibacy and declared by his apostle its worth alongside marriage.”
vocation is gifted by God
celibacy equally good, not better or lesser
even if Paul wishes each person were called to celibacy, he recognizes they aren’t and that he cannot call anyone to celibacy or marriage—only God can (argument against priestly celibacy)
Even the Reformer, John Calvin, recognizes Paul preference for celibacy:
pg 79, Calvin, op. cit., Comm. in 1 Cor 7:8, Vol. III, p 297
“He is, indeed, careful to affirm that it is not a ‘more perfect’ state in the moral sense, but he goes further than simply affirming that ‘there are many advantages in celibacy’.”



pg 80, practical superiority of celibacy, 1 Cor 7: 7-8
“Thus the Christian tradition which is faithful to St. Paul does not admit any spiritual or moral superiority of celibacy over marriage. We have seen St. Paul’s clear preference for the state of celibacy in view of the ecclesiastical ministry. But the reasons for that are of a practical sort and, as we shall see, perhaps they also concern the interior life; they are by no means spiritual or moral reasons. In other words, the state of celibacy is not more favorable to salvation or to obedience in the Christian life. The state of celibacy does not make the Christian life easier, any more than marriage does. In each of these states there are graces and difficulties which, though different, are allotted equally.”

Calvin, op cit Comm in 1 Cor 7.8, Vol. III, p 297
“‘Now St Paul Addresses his remarks to virgins, to all who are not married, and to widows (1 Cor 7:8). He agrees that to live in celibacy is a thing which they ought to desire, if they are capable of doing it; still, each person must consider what power has been given to him. In short, there are many advantages in celibacy, which are not to be despised, provided that each person measures himself by his own ell (as the proverb goes), in other words, according to his own ability. And in consequence, even though we may, if we wish, exalt virginity to the third heaven, it still remains true that it is not suitable for all but only for those who have this particular gift from God.’”
celibacy is better if we are called to it
marriage is better if we are called to it
neither is suitable without a calling and corresponding gift



1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verse 9: But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.




[Notes]
Verse 9: But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.




1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
“…better to marry than to burn…” (v. 9)

If marriage is seen as a high vocation, not a remedy for sin, sexual immorality communicates poor stewardship, not a person’s vocation




[Notes]
This is commonly used as a weapon against celibacy. Some say, ”See, verse 9 says that if you struggle with being single, that means you don’t have the gift of singleness and you should marry.” Let’s dig into that a little bit.

In Calvin’s discussion of this verse, he recognizes that there are different levels of temptation. Calvin recognizes that some are tempted so strongly that they give in or they seem to have no willingness to resist. Perhaps he is right that these people are not called to a vocation of celibacy.

But, is it wise to then to offer marriage as a remedy for poor sexual stewardship? If you have a low view of marriage based solely on the Old Testament as Calvin and Luther do, you may be comfortable treating marriage this way. But Christians should have a higher view of marriage in light of Jesus and Paul’s instituting the vocation of marriage with specific theological purposes. Because of that, we should be afraid of encouraging a person struggling with sexual sin to bring that into a marriage. Not only does that expose a wife and children to the destruction of his poor sexual stewardship, but that marriage is an ugly image of Christ and the Church.

Every Christian struggles with temptation. Every married friend of mine has told me the same thing: marriage and children do not make sexual purity any easier—it’s just different. Many of them have said it makes their fight for purity more difficult because they feel they have more to lose. To suggest that sexual temptation is an indicator of one’s calling is to suggest that only asexual people are called to celibacy. That was clearly NOT Christ’s intention.

More likely what is going on is Paul is reprimanding that third group of people we talked about earlier—the group of people who were taking advantage of the false theology that our bodies didn’t matter by remaining single and indulging in sexual immorality. He is commanding them to take their sexual stewardship seriously. Either commit to celibacy and do it well, or get married and do that well, but continuing in this uncommitted middle space is dangerous.

I sat in the plane next to Russell Moore a month ago, and this verse came up in conversation. When I reflected later, I realized that Matthew 19 and 1 Corinthians 7 help hold two opposite ideas in tension. In 1 Cor 7, Paul is saying that it would be better to marry than commit sexual sin outside of marriage. But in Matt 19, Jesus says the opposite: that it would be better to be single than marry and steward that poorly. I think we should always hold these two ideas in tension. But we should also take note of their audiences. Jesus was speaking to a people who idolized marriage where no one considered celibacy. Paul was speaking to a people who idolized celibacy where few seemed seemed to be walking out marriage well. Which is more similar to the Church today? And whose message do we need to hear more of today? That of Jesus! It would be better to be single than marry and steward that poorly.




1 Cor 7: 8-9, Thurian talking about Calvin pg 92
“Whatever may be the situation of the unmarried men to whom St Paul refers, whether bachelors, widowers or separated husbands, his recommendation is suitable for all: “It is better to marry than to be consumed with desire. Calvin Defines the meaning of this sentence: ‘We must define this word: to burn. Many are pricked by the lusts of their flesh who are, nevertheless, not under the immediate necessity or resorting to the remedy of marriage. He then shows that there are three degrees of temptation. First, when the attacks of desire are so strong that the will gives in. Secondly, when there is no willingness or consent, but when one is so troubled that one can no longer call upon God with a peaceful conscience. In these two degrees the Christian ought perhaps to wonder whether he is really suited to celibacy. In the third place, Calvin considers that there are desires of the flesh which do not lead one to seek sexual intercourse outside marriage and which are not on one’s mind so much that in becomes impossible to pray or to serve God. This third degree of temptation, which is not to be interpreted as the ‘burning’ of which St Paul speaks, and which therefore does not oblige one to doubt Christian celibacy and to marry, is describe by him as follows: ‘Sometimes we are so pricked by the goads of the flesh that we resist courageously and do not allow the true love of chastity to be plucked from our heart; but rather we abhor all evil and infamous affections…If he wins in this struggle, let him give thanks to the Lord, for is there anyone who is not annoyed by his flesh?”
Calvin recognizes that there are those are tempted so strongly that they give in or they seem to have no willingness to resist
Perhaps these people are not called to a vocation of celibacy
But again, based on a low view of marriage that it is merely a remedy for temptation
We have a higher view of marriage and should fear someone with these experiences exposing a wife and children to his poor sexual stewardship which would likely follow him into his marriage
Every struggles with temptation—that is not an indicator of calling

1 Cor 7:8-9
remember 3 groups in Corinth
those called to celibacy and thriving
those marriage and with wrong views of sex that are abstaining
those with low view of the body who are staying single and indulging in sex
More likely Paul is speaking to this third group with this passage
Take your sexual stewardship seriously
Either commit to celibacy and do it right, or get married and do it right, but something in the middle is unwise
You might say lingering in the period of abstinent singleness is unwise

Russell Moore said: seems like 1 Cor 7 makes clear how you know you have the charism for celibacy: that it isn’t difficult
but I would balance this with Jesus’ work in Matt 19
in response to his disciples objections, he basically says that it would be better to be single than to do marriage poorly
Paul: better to marry than commit sexual sin outside of marriage
Jesus: better to be single than marry and steward that poorly
these should be seen to balance other
and the audience and setting are important
Jesus was speaking to a people who idolized marriage and no one considered celibacy
Paul was speaking to a people who idolized celibacy and a majority were living out celibacy



Turn & Talk
What are the consequences of encouraging a person with poor sexual stewardship to get married as a remedy?

The converted partner ought, of course, to do his best to stay with the unbelieving partner, since he may sanctify the latter; if, however, the unbeliever will not admit the conversation and its resultant moral and spiritual consequences, and leaves the Christian partner, then the latter is free to marry. The marriage, which is valid if the unbeliever remains faithful, is nullified by his desertion.” pg 30

Second, we need to make sure we have a proper theological understanding of marriage and celibacy, removing any false theology or emotional baggage that might give us a bias toward one vocation or another

Third, we should let the mission we feel called to help inform our vocation. We’ll speak more about the practical purposes of celibacy and Paul’s preference in a moment, but for now, verses 32-35 communicate that the reason for celibacy is to use that freedom from a spouse and raising children to fully commit oneself to the work of the Church. And in particular, to work parents couldn’t do. So Thurian suggests that if we feel called to a special mission, a difficult ministry, a life of contemplation or study, or monastic life, perhaps that means that we are called to celibacy.

Fourth, we can observe our present and past circumstances to see if they might suggest we are called to celibacy. Thurian says it this way:

pg 86-7, circumstances help us know vocation
1 Cor 7: 17-24
“…the circumstances of life can be signs of the vocation of God. The Lord, who directs all things by his providence, can show a man in his life history his intention of calling him to celibacy. St Paul recalls the meaning of a person’s past history when he writes to the Corinthians…(1 Cor 7:17-24). The apostle does not, of course, make past history into a determinism…But he sees in past life and in present circumstances, in the state or the condition assigned to each man, a result of the providence of God and a way of being led to hear the call of God and of serving him.”

So perhaps if someone is single later in life, that is because God intends for them to be single.Now this is a tricky subject, for which I think Thurian’s words would again be helpful: (next page)



1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
“We have not forgotten that there are people for whom unmarried life was not a free and voluntary choice but was rather an obligation imposed on them by the circumstances of their life…The spiritual direction of these people should gradually lead them to consider that, if they ask for it, God will grant them the gifts necessary for accepting a way of life which they did not choose...”




[Notes]
Thurian, on involuntary singleness, pg 93-4
“We have not forgotten that there are people for whom unmarried life was not a free and voluntary choice but was rather an obligation imposed on them by the circumstances of their life. They were not able to marry, although they would have liked to do so. We should not speak of vocation or choice on the part of these men and women. However, this does not mean that the hard sacrifice which was imposed on them cannot take on a meaning in the plan of God. They can realize afterwards that this condition which was imposed on them has enabled them, in spite of great difficulties, to serve the Church more freely. The spiritual direction of these people should gradually lead them to consider that, if they ask for it, God will grant them the gifts necessary for accepting a way of life which they did not choose...”



1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 17-24 and 32-35 help inform how a person discerns their relational vocation:
General capacity for discernment
Proper theological understanding
Consider one’s mission (32-35)
Practical circumstances (17-24)
Support from one’s church





[Notes]
And fifth, the individual should seek support from his or her church in the discernment process. Thurian suggests this as a guard against subjectivity: mentors and friends can often provide better advice with an outside perspective.



I want to read Thurian’s summary of the discernment process:

pg 88, summary of discernment
“The sum up, a vocation is revealed by the light of the Holy Spirit which creates peace and joy; by a man’s past life and present circumstances interpreted as signs of God’s providence; in the act of faith and the self-commitment based on the Word of God; and by the counsel of the Church, which gives by the laying-on of hands the seal of God on the choice of man and the power of the Holy Spirit which enables him to remain faithful.” - Max Thurian

pg 86, discernment
“The call and the gift of God are, in the first place, revealed by the interior witness of the Holy Spirit; this produces joy and peace in the consideration and choice of one vocation rather than another.”
but be careful about false consolation
we need to have muscles for discernment
proper theological understanding of each vocation so false theology or anything else biases us against one vocation or another
then discern

pg 86, mission helps discern, 1 Cor 7: 32-35
“It should be added that celibacy is only a circumstance, a state and a position demanded by a call of God which is greater and more complex—a special mission or a difficult ministry which would make family life impossible and which requires complete unattachedness; a life of contemplation or study which calls for entire freedom of spirit; life in a regular community for the sake of witness or of a freely available ministry in the Church. So celibacy cannot be considered a vocation for its own sake, but only in terms of a special service for God.”
if called to celibacy, its for a purpose
still a call to sacrificial ministry for the church

pg 87, certainty of call
“A Man will never have complete certainty concerning his vocation and the rightness of his choice. He must, to a certain extent, make a leap in the dark. Sometimes it is not until after decision and self-commitment that a vocation becomes clearer and more certain. God wills the just to live by faith, in other words, often by decisions that are more or less blind, and not by sight, by logical reasoning, by objective criteria or by miraculous visions. If God grants these things, we must bless him for them, but they are not necessary for the response to a vocation. This act of faith and this decision, which sometimes have to be made without evidence or insight, are not, however, unmotivated acts or a sort of wager. The act of faith, the response to a vocation, the decision for a way of life or the choice of a ministry are founded on the Word of God, read and meditated upon in a spirit of prayer. Thus the assurance given by Christ in the Gospel that celibates for the kingdom of heaven’s sake are following his example and are in communion with his manhood, and the assertions of St Paul concerning the value of celibacy for the ministry, will be supports on which faith and decision can be solidly based.”
no diff than marriage
discern and consider practical things
and then make a decision
leap

pg 87, church help discern
“Finally, the Christian is not alone in his decision; he is attended by the Church, by a community, by spiritual direction which can help him to discern his vocation. In this way he can avoid the subjectivity of a too personal choice. The counsel of his fellow Christians will give his resolution the objective character that will reassure him in moments of doubt.”
the Church needs to guide us in discerning
friends and mentors should give input
so we dont unduly influence our decision from our own desires



1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 32-35
Define more clearly the practical purposes of celibacy: freedom from raising children to do more demanding kingdom work




[Notes]
Verses 32-35 define more clearly the practical purposes of celibacy: freedom from raising children to do more demanding kingdom work

Thurian, Calvin, and Vinet all point out that the purpose of celibacy is freedom from raising children to fully commit oneself to kingdom work, and each, even Calvin, recognize that Paul preference for celibacy at least seems to communicate a practical superiority of celibacy. 



28-35: practical superiority
1 Cor 7: 26-29, 32-35, practical purposes of celibacy, Paul confirming Jesus, celibacy not just for priests
"St Paul, who claimed for all (1 Tim 4:3) the right to marry, did not for that reason honour celibacy less. Not only did he recommend it as expedient during the dangerous times through which the Church was passing (1 Cor 7:26-29), but also as a means of giving oneself more completely to God (1 Cor 7:32-35). In this he merely repeated the teaching of Jesus Christ himself (Matt 19:10-12). In the passages quoted neither St Pual nor his master before him had one particular order in the Church in mind; but surely a counsel of perfection must concern the clergy the most of all the Church." A. Vinet, Theologie pastorale, Payot, Lausanne, 1942, pp. 160-161

(1 Cor 7, Calvin, practical purpose of celibacy) v 32-35
"Now the point of the whole argument is this--celibacy is better than marriage because there is more freedom in celibacy, so that men can serve God more easiliy; yet no compulsion must be imposed, so that it may be permissible to anyone to marry when he thinks fit; and finally, marriage is a remedy ordained by God to help our weakness, and is to be used by anyone who does not possess the gift of continence." J. Calvin, Commentaires sur le N.T., Societe des Livres religieux, Toulouse, 1894, Comm, in I Cor 7.38, Vol. III, p. 311.

1 Cor 7:32-35
pg 82
“In theory the celibate is less divided and can give himself more completely to the ministry, to God and men…”
practical superiority because not busied with raising kids

pg 83. practical purposes, 32-35
“It may happen in practice these two advantages of celibacy, in which its value for ministry and for devotion consists, are not experienced because of disobedience and lack of faith in the vocation.”

1 Cor7:35
doesnt want to ensnare by advocating a way of life for which they have no vocation
pg 72

v 7-8, 32-35
“The Second Helvetic Confession of 1566, which was for a long time the rule of faith for many Reformed churches, speaks of celibacy as a ‘gift’ and a ‘vocation’, and adds: ‘Besides, such persons (to whom God has given celibacy) are more included to concern themselves with godly matters than those who are distracted by their family.”
La Confession helvetique posterieure, XXIX, Delachaux et Niestle, Neuchatel, 1944, p. 140
practical superiority of celibacy for purpose of ministry
not compulsery—based on a call



Turn & Talk
How can your church better help teens and young adults discern their relational vocation? Help grow their “spiritual muscles” for discernment? Help them gain a proper theological understanding? Help them discern their mission?



2:18

[Notes]
So we’ve just talked about discerning one’s relational vocation. Let’s think about application in your churches: particularly for those of you who are youth ministers…

we’ve got to teach parents, teach teens, and create spaces for this



1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 25-31: Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is. Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not; those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.




[Notes]
Now back to verses 25-31

Verses 25-31: Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is. Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not; those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.

In general, these verses suggest for the individual to remain as they are
But the most consequential verse here is verse 26



1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
“Because of the present crisis…” (v. 26)

A powerful minority of Christians fully committed to addressing the brokenness of the world is no less needed today




[Notes]
Paul saw that there was much work for the Church to do and fully committing oneself to that work was costly—too costly to jeopardize a family. He wasn’t thinking of just literal martyrdom, but also the decades-long laying down of one’s life for the Gospel. 

Now perhaps there has been a time since the time of Jesus when the need for celibate people was less and persecution and brokenness in the world was less.

But this world seems no less broken today and no less in need of a generation of celibates than the time of Paul
And while persecution is more subtle, the clever, hidden monolith of Satan's work fights skillfully

Both Thurian and Barth balk at the idea of using verse 26 to reject celibacy. 

pg 85, K Barth Kirchliche Dogmatik, III 4, p 160, celibacy is normative
“In repudiating this way of celibacy, or allowing it only as an exception, would one not be falling back wrongly into a conception peculiar to the Old Testament?”
pg 85 Max Thurian, normative
“The Reformed Tradition, in its criticism of the celibacy that is compulsory for the priesthood in the Western Church, was led without noticing it to consider Christian celibacy as something quite out of the ordinary and decidedly odd. In doing this—not forgetting but ignoring what St Paul says about celibacy—the Reformed Church came to make marriage the general rule for all Christians. It was a relapse into the glorification of marriage and the family proper to the Old Testament.”



1 Cor 7:26, present distress, practical meaning/purpose/beauty, pg 107
“The apostle, foreseeing the persecutions of which the Christians will be the victims, considers that it is advantageous for them to remain unmarried. In this remark there is not only the prospect of martyrdom, which it is hard for a family man to accept, but also the idea that the married state involves a crowd of worries which can distract a man from the cares of the ministry…it is just a questions of choosing between a life exclusively devoted to the cares of the Christian ministry (and therefore also assailed by the many anxieties of obedience to Christ, of the mission which one seeks to fulfill and of the community to which one belongs) and a life divided between two sorts of preoccupations, both willed by God, that of the cares of marriage and that of the cares of the Church…The apostle does not dramatize the division in the heart of Christian husbands or wives. He does not blame them for marital and family cares. The mutual love of married people and their seeking to please one another is for them a way of serving the Lord indirectly. But this service is indirect, whereas celibacy allows a man to put all his time and cares into the direct service of God and of the Church”
Paul saw that there was much work for the Church to do and fully committing oneself to that work was costly—too costly to jeopardize a family
not just literal martyrdom, but also the decades-long laying down of one’s life for the Gospel
also not distracted by worries of children
serving the Church more directly
perhaps there has been a time since the time of Jesus when the need for celibate people was less and persecution and brokenness in the world was less
but this world seems no less broken today and no less in need of a generation of celibates than the time of Paul
and while persecution is more subtle, the clever, hidden monolith of Satan's work fights skillfully




1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 36-38: If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing. So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.

1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 36-38
Highlight and praise an early form of vowed, permanent celibacy




[Notes]
Verses 36-38 highlight and praises an early form of vowed, permanent celibacy

Thurian explains that the most convincing translation of these verses is that Paul is talking two single people who have accepted a call to celibacy and have made a commitment of non-sexual, non-romantic companionship to each other. This practice, called spiritual betrothals, was common in the early Church. Sometimes these individuals even lived together. Celibate women often entered into this arrangement for financial support and physical protection. But by the late 4th century, the Church forbid this practice, once the wiser alternative of monastic communities for celibate people are available. So we can understand Paul to be recognizing and praising this early practice of vowed, celibate people. He allows this risky practice because communities for celibate people are not yet available, but he also wields his authority to allow them to break their vows of celibacy and marry, because the support they need is not yet available. But he shows a clear preference that they would remain celibate. Paul says that the man who is called to celibacy—who has “settled the matter in his own mind” and “has made up his mind”—does the “right” thing and then says that he does “better”. And this allowance to break vows passed by the 4th century when communities of celibate people were thriving. Thurian goes on to say that if Paul was still recommending celibacy, even when communities to support celibate people were not yet available, how much more should we recommend celibacy today when there are so many more opportunities for celibate Christians.

Now again, we’ve heard Calvin and Luther’s arguments against a permanent vocation of celibacy. As we’ve seen, they are poorly supported, having a low view of marriage from the Old Testament and using marriage as a remedy for weakness. This seems to reveal that their opposition to permanent celibacy had less to do with theology and more to do with trying to find a justification for Luther breaking his vows of celibacy.



1 Cor 7:36-38 pg 73-75
spiritual betrothal
“This passage alludes to what may be called spiritual betrothal. This was a promise of mutual and lifelong faithfulness made by a young man and a girl without breaking the pledge of celibacy which they had previously taken; sometimes they even lived together. In other cases girls who wished to remain in celibacy and to practice asceticism put themselves under the protection of a reliable man. This practice was know in the early Church and opposed by St John Chrysostom; it was finally forbidden because of the dangers and abuses to which it often led. This dangerous custom is only explained by the existence of the pledge of celibacy from the beginning of the Church, and by the absence of the communities which later enabled women pledged to celibacy to find a setting suitable to their life and ministry. With the appearance of ascetic groups which gave birth to regular communities the dangerous and temporary practice in certain churches of ‘spiritual betrothal’ had no longer any reason for survival.
So St Paul warns the spiritually betrothed against the risks they are running; and above all, with his full apostolic authority, he releases them from their promise should they feel included to marry. They do not possess the setting necessary to enable them to persevere to the end, such as would be possessed by monks and nuns in the future. However, if they are able to remain celibate without compulsion and by their own free choice, the apostle praises them for it. Here we see very clearly the existence from the beginning of the Church of pledges of celibacy, which St Paul approves and praises. Although he feels obliged to release some of them from these pledges, using his ecclesiastical and spiritual authority, it is not because he reproves or condemns voluntary celibates but because he considers them insufficiently protected and supported. They are endangered by ’spiritual betrothal’, which takes the place for them, rather too precariously, of a regular community."
recognizes and praises vowed permanent celibacy
uses his authority to allow to break vows, but it is a temporary allowance because communities for celibate people are not yet available
clear preference that they would remain celibate
and allowance to break vows passes with the presence of communities

why spiritual betrothal? makes no sense that a father would be sinning by breaking pledge to keep daughter celibate—no such thing existed and no reason giving your daughter in marriage would be considered sin
“let them marry” in v 36 would make sense if this is talking about father because plural verb yet no previous reference to the couple, only to father + daughter

1 Cor 37-38 pg 76
“But if the man has a vocation of celibacy (‘firm in his heart’), if he does not feel constrained by a false conception of Christian morals or of his duty to the Church (’subjected to necessity’), if he is able to act with a free conscience (‘according to his own will’), and he makes that pledge of protecting a virgin who wishes to give herself to God in celibacy (‘has decided in his heart’), he does well, he does better than if he marries her. The apostle considers that it is better for a man to keep his promise to a celibate woman whom he is protecting than to marry her, even though the latter course may be a good thing in certain cases.”
if a man is convinced he is called to celibacy and that is not contradicted by sexual immorality, it is better to keep his vow of celibacy

pg 77, 1 Cor 36-38
“This is in site of their difficult and dangerous position (which seems unthinkable to us) in a pagan society and under the protection of an unmarried man; a situation which the Church did not allow in later times. How much more should we rejoice in vocations which imply celibacy, and support and encourage them, nowadays when Christian celibacy finds a protection, a setting and a strength in communities within the Church, with their fraternal and family spirit, their rule and their liturgy.”
if under these difficult circumstances of Paul’s time, he still suggested celibacy
how much more should we suggest it today when it is so much more viable

1 Cor 7:37, vowed/pledged
Paul encourages celibates to keep their vow/pledge

Thurian, pg 102, permanence, equally normative as marriage
‘Likewise in celibacy, consecrated by entry into a community and a ministry and strengthened by the laying-on of hands, there is this pledge of God in his call and in the gifts which he confers. Christ promised to those who would leave all, particularly the prospect of marital and family life, for his sake and the Gospel’s, an hundredfold now in this time, and in the world to come eternal life…Thus every man’s ‘proper gift of God, one after this manner and another after that’ (1 Cor 7:7) is irrevocable, ‘for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance (Rom 11:29). In this certainty the Christian celibate will find the peace and the detachment necessary for effective prayer and ministry.”
settling down into celibacy and accepting its permanence will provide the peace and detachment necessary to fully commit to receive the gift of celibacy and have effective ministry

pg 88-9, permanence of vocation
“If the gift of celibacy is only given for a time, it is not easy to see in what way this state bears a spiritual character which distinguishes it from a mere waiting for marriage. In that case can we really speak of a gift?…Besides, there is no reason why one should be authorized to confer a permanent character on marriage when this is not involved in celibacy. If it is admitted that permanent commitment to an exclusive, indissoluble marriage does not limit the liberty of the Holy Spirit, that liberty must not be invoked in order to refuse a permanent character to celibacy."

God does not give the gift of singleness and later take it away anymore than he gives the gift of marriage and then takes it away

pg 89 permanence of vocation
Protestant arguments against permanence aren’t based in Scripture
they are made to justify Luther’s breaking of his vows
and its based on the argument that marriage is a remedy for weakness
OT theology
no recognition of how Jesus instituted the vocation of Christian marriage
and the vocation of Christian celibacy



1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 39-40: A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

1 Corinthians 7: 1-40
Verses 39-40
Affirm the permanence of marriage and Paul’s preference for celibacy




[Notes]
Paul affirms the permanence of marriage
And if widowed, a person is free to marry if that is there vocation
but again, Paul’s hope is that a widow would feel a call to celibacy as he prefers that vocation

Paul confirms the teachings of Jesus: there are two vocations, they are called by God, and they are permanent. Paul communicates his preference for celibacy, praises early forms of vowed, permanent celibacy, and describes the practical purposes of celibacy: freedom from raising children to do more demanding kingdom work 



1 Cor 7:39-40 affirms the indissoubility of marriage
“And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife” (1 Cor 7:10-11) pg 29

1 Cor 7:39-40
if widowed, free to marry if that is her vocation
but again, Paul’s hope is that a widow would feel a call to celibacy as he prefers that vocation



1 Timothy 5: 5-15
The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. Give the people these instructions, so that no one may be open to blame. Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.




[Notes]
Paul reaffirms his high view of vowed celibacy and communicates that breaking that vow is a sin

Then read:

1 Timothy 5: 5-15
As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge. Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also busybodies who talk nonsense, saying things they ought not to. So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.

1 Timothy 5: 5-15
Paul reaffirms his high view of vowed celibacy and communicates that breaking that vow is a sin




[Notes]
Paul speaks of a pledge of celibacy in verse 12
And throughout but in verse 12 particularly, He reaffirms his high view of vowed, permanent celibacy
He gives practical instructions as to who should be let in the order of widows, but he does so reluctantly because young widows have poorly discerned their vocation, failed to keep their vow, and committed serious sin by breaking their vow
It would have better for them to have first discerned marriage or kept their vow to a vocation of celibacy

Thurian and St. Augustine agree, going as far as to call breaking one’s vow of celibacy infidelity.

Calvin has something to say about this verse too.
(1 Tim 5:12, Calvin, vow of celibacy)
“Now there are two main reasons why we condemn this tyrannical rule of lifelong abstinence from marriage. First, because they consider it to be meritorious service in the sight of God; second, because they plunge wretched souls into ruin by the rashness of making a vow lightly and without having given it sufficient thought.” 
Calvin: ibid., Comm. in 1 Tim 5:12, Vol IV, p. 199
His best arguments against vowed, permanent celibacy is that the Catholic Church valued celibacy over marriage and pushed people into celibacy who were not genuinely called. And Thurian would agree: the Catholic Church mis-stepped in those ways. But that does not invalidate a healthy practice of celibacy, valued equal to marriage, and carefully discerned.

Now you might protest: Paul allowed them to break their vows, even though it was a sin. So it’s okay, right? What Paul is saying here is that if you have made a vow to marriage or celibacy, God’s best is for you to keep your vow. Not doing so is serious sin. Even if you married the wrong person, weren’t called to marriage at all, or weren’t called to celibacy. It is still serious sin. Will some of you remedy that by breaking your vow and sinning? Yes. I wish you wouldn’t, but I know some of you have been so reckless and careless in making your vows that there might be less sin by breaking your vows and living how God actually called you rather than honoring your vows. But, God would rather you honor your vows and fully commit yourself to walking them out faithfully.

Paul reaffirms his preference for vowed celibacy and communicates that breaking that vow is a sin



1 Tim 5:5-15, pg 94-95
speaks of widows who has fully committed herself to prayer and serving God and the Church
“There must have been a pledge by which widows bound themselves to the service of the Church and which permitted them to be enrolled in a special group (1 Tim 5:9). After enjoining widows in general to remain as they are, a state which seems happier to him (1 Cor 7:40), St Paul expresses himself more cautiously in his letter to Timothy… (1 Tim 5:11-12). Here there is a very clear allusion to a pledge who violation merits condemnation. St Paul is indeed cautious and wishes the younger widows to marry; he also orders that only older women should be enrolled in the group of widows. This, however, does not at all invalidate the fact that a pledge was provided for and that the violation of that pledge was considered blameworthy.”
clearly some kind of vow
practical considerations
recognizes that some young widows mistakenly rushed into a vow of celibacy
but still at fault and would have been better if they kept their vow

St Augustine, De conjugiis adulterinis, Book I, ch. XXIV, Migne, P.L. 40, 468 - vowed permanent celibacy
“Once these and other vows have been pronounced, when they are made in the regular forms, they may on no condition be broken, because the resolution was made unconditionally. This is a commandment of the Lord; these words enable us to understand it: ‘Make your vows to the Lord your God, and perform them’ (Ps. 76:11). The apostle derives from this his judgement on some women who, having previously made a vow of continence, afterwards wish to marry, although they were perfectly free to marry before their vow; ‘They incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge’ (1 Tim 5:12).”
clear that vows are to be kept and that to break them is a sin
women should have more carefully discerned their calling
once make vow, it is sin to break

1 Tim 5:11, pg 109-10, breaking vow is infidelity
“When St Paul reproves the young widows, who pledged themselves to the service of the Church, for failing in their first pact of faith to Christ by wishing to remarry, he write that ‘they have begun to wax wanton against Christ’ (1 Tim 5:11). We must not see here a moral judgement against marriage in general, but a reproof addressed to celibates who break faith after having resolved to consecrate their body and their spirit directly to the Lord. When one has given one’s whole being to Christ, to the honor of his flesh, in order to be united to him in all the conditions of his human life, it is infidelity to break that union.”



Turn & Talk
Opponents of vowed, permanent celibacy argue that vows limit God and the possibility of marriage should be available as a remedy for weakness. To what extent are these arguments convincing? Are you surprised by the weakness of those arguments?



2:45

[Notes]
Covering the end of 1 Cor 7 and 1 Tim 5, we’ve heard Calvin and Luther’s arguments against vowed, permanent celibacy…



There is just as much direct, self-evident support for our theology of Christian marriage as there is for this theology of the vocation of celibacy
Theologically, it is equal in every way
The difference is you have accepted a tradition about the theology of marriage
But you are unwilling to accept a tradition about the theology of celibacy

THEOLOGY


[Notes]
now that we’ve gone through each passages and explored what each of them might be telling us about the vocation of celibacy, let’s gather all of those strands together and see what they lead us to



Theology of Celibacy
Relational Vocation - a calling to mission and family with specific theological and practical purposes, vowed, given a provision to thrive, and permanent




[Notes]
remember our definition of vocation:
Relational Vocation: a calling to mission and family with specific theological and practical purposes, vowed, given a provision to thrive, and permanent
the Church has consistently understood the Scriptures to teach the following about the vocation of celibacy:



Theology of Celibacy
A vocation of equal theological and practical beauty that involves renouncing romance, marriage, and sex for the purposes of greater kingdom work and special theological beauty. It is still a call to intimacy in the context of family. It is vowed and permanent. Everyone should submit this question to God, and our vocation is given/called. Everyone has the same capacity for marriage or celibacy, and celibacy is just as normative.






Theology of Celibacy
“A vocation”

Luke 18:28-30 - 100-fold blessing suggest even greater, at the very least the same
1 Cor 7:1-40 - paul shows a preference for celibacy (1-8, 36-38, 40), practical superiority (28-35)



Theology of Celibacy

[Notes]
If you’ve attended another of EQUIP’s trainings in the past year, you’ve probably heard us talk about how 6 elements describe the love of God found in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church
God’s love is complementary, intimate, procreative, committed, sacrificial, and hospitable
And both marriage and celibacy are images of this love in order to teach us about God’s love
Celibacy not only embodies these 6 qualities, but it also preaches the gospel in unique ways, particularly in contrast to the idol of romance



special theological beauty (trinity, christ+church, gospel, NHNE, preaches the gospel in contrast to the idol of romance) (diverse, ***intimacy, ***spiritually procreative, ***sacrificial, ***committed, ***hospitable) (will need to tease those 6 things out first)
Isaiah 56:3-5 - spiritual procreative, sacrificial points to Trinity and Christ+Church
Matthew 19:1-12 - sacrifice, spiritually procreative, and committed points to Trinity and Christ+Church
Luke 18-28-30 - giving up these things, in contrast to idol of romance, will lead to 100-fold in this life and the next + intimacy, spiritually procreative, sacrificial points to Trinity and Christ+Church

1 Timothy 5:5-15 - vow of celibacy good and to break it is a sin



Theology of Celibacy
“and permanent”
Matthew 19:1-2 – Jesus compares the celibate to eunuchs, which is permanent
Luke 18:28-30 – We cannot imagine Jesus providing the 100-fold blessing and then someone getting married
1 Cor 7:1-40 – Paul teaches it is better to keep a vow of celibacy and does not teach marriage as a remedy for weakness

[Notes]
Permanent and irrevocable

1 Cor 7:1-40 - practical circumstances (17-24) and mission help discern calling (28-35)
1 Timothy 5:5-15 - makes clear need for careful discernment



Theology of Celibacy
“and our vocation is given/called”

1 Cor 7:1-40 - God gives the calling and gift of marriage or celibacy
1 Timothy 5:5-15 – Paul speaks of needing to clearly understand God’s call




[Notes]
given/called, not chosen
Matthew 19:1-12 - both vocation of marriage and celibacy are given: an ability to accept Jesus’ teachings and follow them is given to those who are called to it, chosen in the sense that God wishes for our preference to be conformed to God’s preference and no one should be forced into celibacy unless call
1 Cor 7:1-40 - God gives calling and gift of marriage or celibacy (1-8)
1 Timothy 5:5-15 - speaks of needing to clearly understand God’s call



Theology of Celibacy
“Everyone has the same capacity for marriage or celibacy”
In light of the fall, romance, sex, and polygamy are natural. None of us have what we need to do celibacy or marriage well. Both require a calling and gift/provision to do well. Neither is natural.
Matthew 19:1-12 - If you don’t have gift of marriage, you shouldn’t do it
1 Cor 7:1-40 - If you don’t have the gift of celibacy, you shouldn’t do it
Luke 20:34-36 - We will all be celibate in the NHNE, so celibacy must be part of the created order for each of us




[Notes]
everyone has same capacity (but none have enough)
in light of the fall, romance, sex, and polygamy are natural
none of us have what we need to do celibacy or marriage well
both require a calling and gift/provision to do well
neither natural
Matthew 19:1-12 - if don’t have gift of marriage, shouldn’t do it
1 Cor 7:1-40 - if don’t have the gift of celibacy, shouldn’t do it (1-9, 36-38, 40)
Luke 20:34-36 - we will all be celibate one day, part of created order that will be fulfilled in NHNE



Theology of Celibacy
“and celibacy is just as normative”
Isaiah 56:3-5 - Celibates will have family, belonging, and honor equal to the married person, they will be full and equal members of the family of God, they will be spiritual parents in ways just as great as biological parents
Matthew 19:1-12 – Jesus suggests that the average Jew should now consider celibacy, lifting up celibacy from being an exceptional vocation for only a few to an equally normative calling for the average Christian
1 Cor 7:1-40 – Paul teaches that celibacy as normative for this age and for any person, he recognizes that we are all tempted, rejecting the normativity of celibacy is to reject the New Testament, and there is even more support for celibacy today




[Notes]
based on this language in Scripture, what would we guess is the number of people that God is calling to lifetime singleness?
here’s my educated guess: 10% of people are called to a vocation of celibacy. where does this come from? at a basic level, it’s gotta be greater than the current number of less than 1% of Christians who accept a call to lifetime singleness today. 1% is not normative or common. That is an exception, weird, abnormal. That is not what Jesus meant for celibacy. A number like 10% better reflects a less common but equally normative vocation. There’s also demographic data to help back this up. Back in the 80s and 90s before our current low rates of marriage, 10% of people never married, and another 10% of people got divorced and remarried. Now I’m not saying all 20% of those people were meant never to marry and were called to lifetime singleness. But based on those numbers, 10% seems like a reasonable number.



normative
Isaiah 56:3-5 - the celibate will have family, belong, and honor equal to the married person, they will be full and equal members of the family of God, they will be spiritual parents in ways just as great as biological parents
Matthew 19:1-12 - institutes vocation of celibacy and suggest that average Jew should now consider celibacy, lifting up celibacy from being an exceptional vocation for only a few to an equally normative calling for the average Christian
1 Cor 7:1-40 - normative for this age and for any person (25-27), all tempted (9), rejecting normative is to reject New Testament (25-27), more support for it today (36-38)



Theology of Celibacy
A vocation of equal theological and practical beauty that involves renouncing romance, marriage, and sex for the purposes of greater kingdom work and special theological beauty. It is still a call to intimacy in the context of family. It is vowed and permanent. Everyone should submit this question to God, and our vocation is given/called. Everyone has the same capacity for marriage or celibacy, and celibacy is just as normative.






Turn & Talk
How is this systematic theology of lifetime singleness different from the understanding you came in with today? Are those differences based in Scripture? Culture?
Why don’t we hear these teachings in Protestant churches?



3:19

[Notes]
We’ve explored the passages of Scripture related to lifetime singleness and discovered the strong evidence for this systematic theology of the vocation of celibacy

How is this systematic theology of lifetime singleness different from the understanding you came in with today? Are those differences based in Scripture? Culture?

Why don’t we hear these teachings in Protestant churches?



WHY?


[Notes]
now a number of you are probably wondering why we’ve spent so much time on these passages
you’re saying, "this is great, but can we get to the practical stuff"
"can we get to how we can practically serve the single people in our churches better"
but theres a reason why we've spent so much time on theology
and thats because what we really believe on these topics inform what we do
right belief leads to right practice
and wrong belief leads to wrong practice
and ive got to be honest
i know many of you
ive visited some of your churches
i know single people in your churches
and the reason why single people struggle to thrive in your churches is because of your church’s wrong belief
it’s taught directly or indirectly
That celibacy is too hard for the average Christian
That celibacy is only for gay people or asexual people or people who dont want to marry or have kids
That we get to choose whether we get married or commit to celibacy
That if we want marriage or kids that means God wants marriage for us
That marriage is the most beautiful relationship and that it is the highest image of God’s love
That the most important work a Christian can do is be a parent
We don’t teach children and teens to consider celibacy
Instead, they assume they will get married
We assume they will get married
And we pray for their future spouse and children
We idolize romance to the detriment of both marriage and celibacy

So if we spent 4 hours on practical steps your churches could take but we never corrected your beliefs, nothing would get better
nothing would change

instead of being stuck in the Old Testament
instead of teaching what culture has to say about these topics
instead of teaching an idolatry of romance
you’ve got to start teaching what the Bible has to say about these topics—the whole Bible

now I dont want you to turn off after hearing that
I dont want you to misunderstand my anger as rage or resentment or uncontrolled
I want you to see it as flipping tables
when Jesus saw that religious people with power, from wrong belief, had wrong practice, that particularly hurt those on the edges of the people of God, Jesus flipped tables
I’m in a room filled with pastors
And although you didn't known any better, your wrong belief about singleness has led some to miss their call to lifetime singleness and others to starve from lack of proper teaching, modeling, community, and support
The only just response is anger

We’re going to move on to practical application
But I encourage each of you to spend some time after today asking yourself, “Does what I believe and teach (or not teach) about singleness really come from the Bible? Or does it come from somewhere else? Do they come from the oh-so-powerful idol of romance in our culture and churches? What does the Bible really say about this? And what would be different if I really taught that and let it inform the ministry our church offers, even if it makes people in my church and their comfortable idol of romance uncomfortable?"

Supporting Celibacy



Teach it – 
Across the lifespan, we must share the rich theology of celibacy in Scripture

[Notes]
We need to teach children in our churches about the rich theology of celibacy in Scripture
every time we talk about marriage, we need to talk about celibacy

From a young age, we need to start sharing that both marriage and celibacy are beautiful possibilities
And just as much as we talk about the beauty of being a father or a mother, we need to talk about the beauty of heroes of the faith who were able to do more for the kingdom because they were single
As they reach puberty and start to explore relationships with others, our argument for abstinence shouldn’t be based on “saving ourselves for marriage”
But instead focus on pleasing God and God’s design for relationship, recognizing the possibilities of marriage and celibacy

How do we do this, practically?




Supporting Celibacy



Teach it – 
Study this carefully alone and with other leaders
Teach parents to think and teach
Teach students at all ages

[Notes]
Well first, before you or other leaders at your church start teaching on this topic, you have to know what you believe
Are you convinced of what we offered here today?
Or are you hanging on to another theology that is more culturally convenient but lacks evidence?
You need to rethink how you think theologically about celibacy, and you need to study that with other leaders in your church

Then before you ever talk to teens or children about this, you need to teach parents
They will spend many more hours with their children than you will
And even if they never think they’ve had a theological conversation with their kids, we send signals every day about how we think the world works and what we think is most beautiful
Does the average parent in your church believe what we taught today? Would they be able to teach it to their kids?
If not, what do they believe, and what are they teaching their kids, even if unintentionally?

After that, we need to teach students at all ages
We need to weave conversation about lifetime singleness into Bible stories, and we need to tell stories about Paul and Jesus and their celibacy
We need to teach teens about this before they go through middle school, so that when romantic and sexual desires hit them, they aren’t prone to running to the idol of romance
We need to prepare graduating teens from your youth group to have a mature theological and practical understanding of marriage and celibacy

I would be happy to help your church take these steps



Supporting Celibacy



Model it – 
To imagine a future that is good and valued, children must see celibate people thriving and leading

[Notes]
Celibacy must be modeled in our churches

we can only imagine a future for ourselves that we see modeled
we will only imagine that future as good and valuable if it is modeled as being such
so the children in our churches need to see celibate people in our churches thriving
the children in our churches need to see celibate people in places of leadership, upfront, honored



Supporting Celibacy



Model it – 
Seek out single people as leaders in your church
Invite single people into your homes

[Notes]
First, your church can be intentional about seeking out leaders who are single
Not only do our children need to see single people valued and as leaders, but they have so much to offer the church in their singleness
We need single head pastors, preaching pastors, worship leaders, youth pastors, children’s pastors, bible study leaders, small group leaders, Sunday school leaders, mentors, elders, youth volunteers, etc.

Invite single people into your homes to be part of your families
children need to hear and see this done well so they can imagine it as a good thing for them



Thriving in Celibacy



Discern it – 
Help teens develop their “spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Invite them to start asking God, “What is your preference?”
Clear emotional and theological hurdles
Continuing supporting discernment

[Notes]
Help teens in your church discern whether they are called to celibacy or marriage

as we teach children and teens how to think theologically about their sexual stewardship and relational vocation, we need to also invite them to discern that
with parents, with mentors, in prayer and Scripture with the Holy Spirit

Here’s what that could look like practically:

Before we start discerning any specific questions, we need to help teens develop their ”spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Do they know how to bring a question before God, consider Scripture, consider practical aspects of their question, seek advice from spiritual mentors, arrive at a potential conclusion, hold that conclusion before God, seek confirmation through small steps, and move forward with confidence?
Before we ask a question as important as marriage or celibacy, let’s practice our skills of discernment on less consequential decisions

invite them to start asking God that question
Invite to ask, “God, would you prefer that I commit to celibacy or get married?”
Will God punish us for choosing the lesser path? I don’t see any support in Scripture for that
But are there likely some consequences for following our preference over God’s? probably
I’m confident that we would probably enjoy the most goodness and beauty in this life by following God’s preference

make sure their are no emotional or theological hurdles to either vocation
We mentioned earlier that a poor theological understand of marriage and celibacy
Or the idol of romance or divorce in their family
All of these may bias their discernment in harmful ways
So we need to help teens work through any biases they might have so they can more clearly hear God’s preference

continue supporting discernment in college and beyond
Few teens will know with certainty what God is calling them to before they graduate from high school
Many will continuing discerning late into their 20s, and maybe beyond
We can provide continued support for an individual’s discernment



Thriving in Celibacy



Discern it – How do we know if we are called to celibacy?
Is the primary mission to which I am called (1) to raise children for the body of Christ or (2) to do something else that is mutually exclusive to raising children for the body of Christ? 

[Notes]
A common question related to discernment is “How does one know that he or she is called to a vocation of celibacy?”
When discerning marriage or celibacy, one question in particular is helpful: Is the primary mission to which I am called (1) to raise children for the body of Christ or (2) to do something else that is mutually exclusive to raising children for the body of Christ? A vow of marriage closes the door on missions that would compete with raising children. A vow of celibacy closes the door on the mission of raising children. If a person feels called to raise children, they should marry. If a person doesn’t feel called to raise children, they probably should commit to celibacy. If a person feels called to a work mutually exclusive to raising children, they should commit to celibacy. If a person doesn’t feel called to a work mutually exclusive to raising children, they probably should marry. But there’s nuance there with “should’’ versus “probably should". In the “probably” space, it is probably best to continue discerning in the period of abstinent singleness.




Thriving in Celibacy



Discern it – Why commit to celibacy?
Fully commit yourself to family with others
Engage in work mutually exclusive with marriage
Settle down and live for the present
Receive the gift of singleness and thrive

[Notes]
Another common question is, “Why commit to celibacy?” which is related to another question “Why distinguish between a vocation of celibacy and the universal period of abstinent singleness? “
Because Jesus and Paul did. Both of them speak in Scripture about a permanent calling/gifting beyond the universal period of abstinent singleness. In Matthew 19, Jesus compares this called/gifted singleness to the eunuch--a permanent state. In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul praises those practicing a vowed and permanent celibacy. The Church has taught consistently that it is not good for a person to languish in the period of abstinent singleness (although there are always exceptions). Just as the benefits of marriage can’t be enjoyed until shutting the door on celibacy, so the full benefits of celibacy can’t be enjoyed without shutting the door on marriage. The Christian who continues in the period of abstinent singleness cannot fully commit to mission or community that is mutually exclusive with raising children until he or she has settled down into celibacy. Instead we see single people who have not committed to celibacy connected loosely to mission and friends, waiting for their spouse when their real life can start. A lifetime without marriage can embody unsurpassed goodness and beauty if the person embraces their call to celibacy. But spending a lifetime waiting for marriage without a vocation is a tragedy. As mentioned earlier, none of us have what we need inherently to do marriage or celibacy well. We will not receive the portion of grace to do either of those vocations well until we commit to the vocation. A person does not receive the portion of grace to do singleness most well until settling down into celibacy.

If you’re single and a number of signs point to you being called to celibacy and you haven’t made a commitment to the vocation and you are struggling mightily with your singleness
Maybe it’s because you haven’t received to portion of grace to do celibacy well that is only given to those to take vows of the vocation of celibacy




Turn & Talk
“A lifetime without marriage can embody unsurpassed goodness and beauty if the person embraces their call to celibacy. But spending a lifetime waiting for marriage without a vocation is a tragedy.” To what extent have you seen this play out among single adults in your church? What is the solution?

Thriving in Celibacy



Support it – 
Large church fellowship
Diverse small groups
Invite singles to couples-only activities
Ask single people what they need and how they want to serve

[Notes]
One of the biggest ways we can support celibate people is by helping them find family

First, we can help them experience family in your church
Start with bigger church fellowships where single people can see themselves as part of a big family—I know it’s harder for larger churches or less conventional churches to have these gatherings, but when a single person’s only connection to the church is showing up alone on Sunday and then a rotating door of small groups, they can feel disconnected from something larger and stable

Then, I’d encourage you to have small group or life groups that bring together people from different stages in life. The only thing worse than finding myself in a small group of only single people where every other guy and girl is trying to figure out who they are going to marry is finding myself in a small group full of newly-marrieds and young parents with one child. The loneliness their for the person committed to lifetime singleness is deep. Instead, let’s trying for diverse small groups that include older adults, older couples, widows, divorcees, and families with kids at different stages. We all have things to learn from each other, and we will feel more connected with the church as a whole when your small group actually reflects the average demographics of the church.

I can’t tell you how often single people shoot out texts seeing what people are doing, end up spending the night alone, and then check facebook or Instagram the next day to find some of their married friends got together for couples-only stuff. Sometimes this is intentional exclusion because couples prefer to hang out with other couples. I’m sure I don’t need to point out the problems with that. But more often, couples think single people would be uncomfortable hanging out with a group of couples, so they don’t invite them. Frequently, I’ve learned about a game night or a dinner party or a bible study of friends that I wasn’t invited to, and when I asked around more, they said they didn’t think I’d want to be there. Please, go out of your way to invite single people to things you might consider couples-only.

And last but not least, ask single people what they need. Get a couple of staff together and invite single people to share with you what they need—they’ll have a better idea than you or me. And, ask them how they’d like to get more involved—how they’d like to leverage their singleness to do even more kingdom work.
but as we’ve noted, celibate people need intimate, committed relationships, just like their married friends
They need a family of companions who they know will be there in a decade
The people who will be their for dinner at night, or to hear about their day, or to go on vacation with them

So we can help them find their inner family



Thriving in Celibacy



Support it – 
Stay with biological family
Join another nuclear family
Create families of celibate people

[Notes]
Here’s 3 ways celibate people can find family:

First, we can encourage people to stay deeply connected to their biological family. This might look like living with a parent, a sibling, or a cousin, doing rhythms of family with those people, and committing to helping them raise the children in that household.

Or, you might help single people knit themselves into unrelated nuclear families in your church. Maybe people go out of their way to choose celibate people as godparents for their children. Or you invite single people to weekly dinner with your family. Or include them in holidays and vacations. You could even invite single people to live in your home, commit to your family, and help you raise your kids.

Or third, you can help celibate people create families of their own
Help celibate people gather together and commit to being family for each other and doing rhythms of family together.
This is perhaps the least conventional of the options suggested here, and while it might be the most beautiful, it also involved the most logistics.
Churches can help support celibate people in creating these intentional Christian communities by suggesting the idea, helping them cast vision for it, providing pastoral support while they explore the possibility, coaching them through the process, and maybe even providing financial support in the early years.
For example, a group of 5 guys and I in Nashville are discerning whether God has called us to start an intentional Christian community for men committed to celibacy where we would take vows committing to do life together for the rest of our lives. This are the kind of solutions the Church needs

Regardless of which path they take, they need intimate, committed, and permanent family just like everyone else
You’ve noticed that each solution involves living together and commitment
We need to help celibate people find that
Because it is particularly hard for celibate people to find that
And the paths are often unconventional



Thriving in Celibacy



Celebrate it – 
Find ways to mark and celebrate the commitments and milestones of celibate people

[Notes]
Celebrate the lives of celibate people

mother’s day, father’s day, anniversaries, marriages, engagement parties, baptism, baby showers
what for celibates? how do we mark and celebrate their commitment?

if there are vows, celebrate and anniversary that ceremony – gather friends and family, witness the individual make commitments to celibacy to God, and have a party afterward
by putting in leadership and valuing
honoring/commissioning leaders
what about those occasions that are harder without a spouse: birthdays, holidays, vacations, buy a home, 




Turn & Talk
What would it take for celibate people to find a depth and permanence of family in your church that provides everything a nuclear family could?

IS SINGLENESS GOOD?


[Notes]
My final question I want to leave you with is this:
Is Singleness Good?
In your church

If not yet, what are you willing to do to make it so?
