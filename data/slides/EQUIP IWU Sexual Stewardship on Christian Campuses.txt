Hi, I’m Pieter Valk
I studied at Vanderbilt University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and Lipscomb University

I am the Executive Director of EQUIP, a team of missionary consultants who help churches and Christian universities become places where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic—according to a conviction that God’s best for His people is either abstinent singleness for the sake of the kingdom or opposite-sex Christian marriage for the sake of raising children
We’ve trained nearly 6,000 Christian leaders in 175 trainings at 41 different Christian universities, campus ministries, and churches, for over 11,000 hours of training

In particular, EQUIP has worked with 10 different Christian universities and campus ministries
Most of that work has been with a Nazarene university in Nashville, a Church of Christ university in Nashville, and campus ministries at an elite private university in Nashville
At the Church of Christ university, I led over 27 different events including trainings RAs, training student life staff, training counseling center staff, training faculty, teaching parents and ministers at a high school recruitment week, starting and running a support group, training future youth pastors, teaching 8 breakout chapels, and teaching 10 different academic class sessions

I am also a Licensed Professional Counselor and I meet with individuals navigating questions of faith and sexuality, including 4 years experience at a Christian university counseling center exclusively serving LGBT+ students with a variety of faith backgrounds and theological beliefs

Why do both of my jobs involve serving gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic?
Why does this work matter so much to me?

Well I’m a Christian, I’m gay, and I’m convinced that God’s best for every Christian is abstinent singleness for the sake of the kingdom or Christian marriage, including me


Sexual Stewardship
on Christian Campuses

[Notes]
Dr. Wright asked me to share from my experience working with Christian universities and colleges 
(1) a robust, winsome vision for an IWU where all students consider God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship and benefit from stewarding their sexualities according to that wisdom, with the hope that students will embrace this wisdom for a lifetime
and (2) effective strategies, practical steps for realizing that vision at IWU



Many universities avoid and delay
Without a robust vision, tangible proof of good fruit, and relationships with stakeholders many Christian universities respond to crisis by…
Scrambling to defend a traditional sexual ethic but failing, leading to institutional decline
Repeated compromise, leading to a sliding abandonment of a traditional sexual ethic

[Notes]
In constrast, Many Christian universities avoid this topic as much as possible
Take small measures in response to crises
And hope that the university will quickly return to the status quo of silence and comfort

In reality, one of two things happens when universities are reluctant to cast a bold, beautiful vision and fail to take the steps necessary to secure that vision

When universities haven’t done the work
They’re either taken off guard by crises, try to scramble to mount a sturdy defense of a traditional sexual ethic, and crumble because they haven’t done the longterm work to cast a vision, build relationships, and demonstrate good fruit
Or they make small compromise after small compromise with different elements of their community, and over decades, the university slides and abandons a traditional sexual ethic

A vision for a faithful IWU
LGBT+ and straight Christian students steward their sexualities in God-honoring ways

Straight Christians students go on to love and support their LGBT+ siblings according to a traditional sexual ethic

[Notes]
I want to cast a vision for something very different

Imagine an IWU where most students graduate either having become a Christian at IWU or having experienced a deepening of their Christian faith
Straight Christian students have become convinced of God’s wisdom in Scripture for their sexual stewardship, and they are committed to walking out their faith in abstinent singleness for the sake of the kingdom or Christian marriage for the sake of raising children
These straight Christian students have also become convinced of the goodness of God’s wisdom in Scripture for gay people and are eager to love and support their LGBT+ siblings according to a traditional sexual ethic
Plus, LGBT+ Christian students have become convinced that abstinent singleness for the sake of the kingdom or opposite-sex Christian marriage is God’s best for them, and they are committing to stewarding their sexualities in God-honoring ways for a lifetime

Imagine an IWU that isn’t satisfied with just slowing the inevitable abandonment of a traditional sexual ethic
And instead aims for much, much more
Aspires to lead other Christian universities in being a place where LGBT+ and straight students embrace and thrive according to God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship during and beyond college

How?

Practical Steps: Before IWU
University has clarified theological perspective for faculty and staff, cast winsome vision, and detailed careful strategy
University has earned the support of alumni, donors, staff, faculty, current students, LGBT+ students, and relevant off-campus groups
University has gathered a team of those who minister to LGBT+ students + trained this team to provide effective pastoral care to LGBT+ students

[Notes]
I want to break down practical steps into three stages for the hypothetical student:
Before IWU
Freshman Year
Year Two and Beyond

First, before an IWU student moves onto campus, four things have happened:

University leaders have clearly described their theological perspective for campus faculty and staff, cast a winsome vision for becoming a university where all students thrive according to God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship, and detailed a careful strategy for realizing this bold vision

University leaders have invested the time and energy to gain the support of community stakeholders for this vision and strategy, including alumni, donors, staff, faculty, current students, LGBT+ students, and relevant off-campus groups

The university has gathered a team of those who minister to LGBT+ students, including
mental health counselors,
RAs, 
Student chaplains,
campus pastors,
student health workers,
student conduct administrators,
Coaches,
Freshman Year Experience faculty and upperclassmen,
Local college pastors,
and professors. In addition, the university has trained this team to provide effective pastoral care to LGBT+ students, within the bounds of their specific professions, including a guide for pastoral responses to common questions and circumstances.
Practical Steps: Before IWU
University communicates clearly to prospective students and parents about the teaching and support for God-honoring sexual stewardship offered
Prevents claims of being misled and clarifies boundaries for all students

[Notes]
Before students step foot on campus, the university communicates clearly to prospective students and parents about the teaching and support for God-honoring sexual stewardship offered, preventing experiences where students feel misled about the university’s beliefs and practices and providing clarity about the boundaries for students in light of these policies


Then the next stage of practical steps takes place during a student’s first year
Practical Steps: Freshman Year
University has highlighted God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship and invited LGBT+ students to connect trained staff to find support and community during student orientation and Freshman Year Experiences
LGBT+ students have heard the stories of past and present students who have benefitted from safe spaces where they could integrate their faith and sexuality

[Notes]
During student orientation and in Freshman Year Experiences, the university has highlighted God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship and invited LGBT+ students to connect trained staff to find support and community. LGBT+ students have heard the stories of past and present students who have benefitted from safe spaces where they could integrate their faith and sexuality.


And finally, during a student’s second year and beyond, we want to take the following practical steps:




Practical Steps: Year Two + Beyond
LGBT+ students find support from campus pastors, coaches, student chaplains, mental health counselors, and professors
University has engaged in ongoing community conversation, exploring God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship for all, and its applications to sexual and gender minorities with nuance and depth.
Required section during NT or Christian Theology class, Chapel, student chaplain events

[Notes]
Across an LGBT+ student’s college experience, LGBT+ students find support from campus pastors, coaches, student chaplains, mental health counselors, local campus pastors, and professors

The university has engaged in ongoing community conversation, exploring God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship for all, and its applications to sexual and gender minorities with nuance and depth. Community conversation may include a required section in freshman NT or Christian theology classes focusing on God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship, all-student and breakout chapels on the topic, student chaplain events on halls, and campus-wide seminars open to the public.
Practical Steps: Year Two + Beyond
LGBT+ students offered fellowship spaces where they can safely enjoy community, whether they prefer fellowship with those of similar or more diverse theological perspectives

LGBT+ and straight Christian students steward their sexualities in God-honoring ways +  straight Christians students go on to love and support their LGBT+ siblings according to a traditional sexual ethic

[Notes]
LGBT+ students are offered fellowship spaces where they can safely enjoy community. LGBT+ students who prefer to fellowship only with those who share a traditional sexual ethic, LGBT+ students who prefer to fellowship only with those who share a progressive sexual ethic, and LGBT+ students who prefer fellowship spaces where both perspectives are prominent have all found accommodating spaces on campus.
These might be led by campus pastors,
Sponsored and/or led by trusted faculty
Or hosted by a local church near campus

And finally, after students graduate, if we’ve taken all of these practical steps, we hope the last step is celebrating with God the good fruit of our faithfulness:
While not all students will graduate having joined the family who call themselves Christians and committed themselves to God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship, the university hopes that straight Christian students will accept a lifetime call to steward their own sexualities in God-honoring ways, even when countercultural. The university hopes straight Christian students have learned how to think in theologically accurate and compassionate ways about LGBT+ topics, leading to greater love and support of their LGBT+ siblings. Plus, the university hopes that LGBT+ Christian students will embrace a lifetime call to God-honoring sexual stewardship and continuing thriving according to God’s wisdom long after college.
A vision for a faithful IWU
Lean into discomfort to accomplish a robust vision

Center the conversation on God-honoring sexual stewardship that brings the most goodness to each of our lives

Commit yourselves to the practical steps necessary to realize that vision, even when risky

[Notes]
Wheaton college, Gordon college, and Calvin university have take some similar steps
But I can’t say that any of them have committed themselves to a vision this bold

But if you’re interested in leading students and other Christian universities with a robust vision for IWU, now is the time
You’ve been forced by circumstances to address these topics publicly
To have this conversation as a community
You’ve already stepped into the discomfort
The band-aid has already been ripped off
Don’t let the moment pass by covering over it with more Band-Aids
Capitalize on it
Do the big work!

And I’d suggest for you to focus, first and foremost on discipleship
You’ve got all of the right voices on this Task Force, and of course a big part of external communication must be about recognizing sexual and gender minorities as people on the margins, particularly in conservative Christian spaces
And welcoming the diversity they contribute to this community

And at the same time, the focus should be discipleship
Universities like Wheaton and Gordon are succeeding where others have failed because with compassion and nuance, they’ve centered the conversation on God’s call for His people to faithfully steward their sexualities in ways that honor God and bring the most goodness to each of our lives

What does that mean for your vision and action to focus on discipleship?
It means cast a bold vision for an IWU where all students consider God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship and benefit from stewarding their sexualities according to that wisdom, with the hope that students will embrace this wisdom for a lifetime
You set that as the goal
You commit yourselves to the practical steps necessary to realize that vision
Even when they’re risky, because half-measures have proven to be ineffective
And the testimony of this institution depends on it
