GET YOUR

BLUEPRINT




[Notes]
Pieter Valk
A little bit about myself

I studied at Vanderbilt University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and Lipscomb University
I have my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and one day a week I meet with LGBT+ undergraduate students at a Christian university navigating questions of faith, sexuality, and identity

And the rest of the week, I’m the Executive Director of EQUIP
A team of missionary consultants committed to equipping the Church with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction
Or to put it another way
We partner with churches to help them become places where LGBT+ people can belong and thrive according to an orthodox Christian sexual ethic

Let’s watch a quick video to learn more



Our Mission
To help churches become places where LGBT+ people can thrive according to historic Christian sexual ethics.




[Notes]
terms



Our Beliefs
Historic Christian sexual ethics - A belief that God’s best for every Christian is either vocational singleness (a lifetime vocation of abstinent singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention) or Christian marriage (a lifetime vocation of opposite-sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom)




[Notes]
terms



Our Stats
Trained over 20,000 Christian leaders in 250 trainings at 85 different churches, Christian universities, and campus ministries.
85% feel ready to have respectful conversation about sexual ethics
90% feel better prepared to minister to sexual minorities
94% found EQUIP trainings to be effective or very effective






Our Vision
We want the Church we leave our children to be one where boys and girls grow up hearing their parents, friends, and pastors talk about sexuality in compassionate and meaningful ways . And if those boys and girls find themselves attracted to other boys or girls of the same sex, we want them to be able to share with their parents, friends, or pastors without fear or shame.




[Notes]
why this matters to me

My story: experiencing same-sex attraction and reconciling that with traditional Christian beliefs that God calls all people to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
 
I felt that alone, afraid, shame, dirty in middle school when I started to realize my attractions
-      Prayed daily that God would fix me, make me normal, make me straight
-      I didn’t have parents or a church around me where I thought it was safe
 
Got to college and took the risk of fully known and fully loved
 
As I made sense of my story and did life with others who experience same-sex attraction, realized my parents and church didn’t know how to speak to my experience or minister to me because they were never taught
 
And their silence on this topic was out of fear of saying the wrong thing and a lack of confidence

That’s why EQUIP does what it does: so that the Church can have that understanding and skills and confidence to put them into practice




Training Goal
To equip your community with the understanding and skills to better love and serve LGBT+ people according to God’s wisdom




[Notes]
Big picture, how do we accomplish this goal?
It starts with a recognition of how poorly the Church is loving and serving LGBT+ people
Next the Church must take responsibility for doing this well
We need to see how we can do this better
And the Church needs to commit the necessary time and energy to accomplish those
Now, what do I mean when I say the Church?
not your pastors
all of us
we are all responsible for collaborating with others to provide what is needed

my hope is that your church would accept the responsibility to share God’s narrative for sexual stewardship with all people and become a place where they can thrive in that

And to do all of that, you need a careful strategy—a Blueprint
That’s why we will spend 3 sessions—6 hours—in EQUIP’s core content
Deepening your understanding and skills
And we will also be identifying potential needs in your church along the way
Every time we mention something that you think highlights a need your church, I want to pause and add that to our giant post-its (I’ll help you out)
At the end of each session, we will brainstorm vision and action items around those needs
And finally, during the 4th session, we will combine the needs, vision, and action items you identified to come up with a Blueprint for your church—a plan to realize your vision of doing this work excellently



Training Objectives
Empathize with LGBT+ people and become churches where all people can belong
Offer God’s narrative for sexual stewardship to all and help LGBT+ people take hold of that
Develop a posture and expertise for individual ministry to LGBT+ people

A better strategy.



Believe
Belong
Become




[Notes]
BELONG – LGBT+ people can find acceptance and unconditional love, talk about their experiences without shame, find meaningful, intimate community
BELIEVE – offer complex and winsome theology of sexuality, walk alongside people as they come to believe what is true
BECOME – compassionately and effectively minister to LGBT+ persons as they become who Christ has called them to be



A better strategy.

WELCOME


[Notes]
Once we develop empathy toward LGBT+ people
Developing a posture for welcoming marginalized people




Orphans
Widows
Sojourners
The Bible
God
Marginalized People
Welcoming the Marginalized

Belong

[Notes]
The Old and New Testaments recognize three groups of people at risk of marginalization, one of which are sojourners
Theologians and lay people have asked what God’s posture is toward sojourners and how that ought to inform the Church’s posture toward the marginalized people of the current era, including LGBT+ people. 





Sojourner (n): a stranger, alien, or foreigner; “to dwell for a time”; “to live among people who are not blood relatives” 

Welcoming the Marginalized

Belong

[Notes]
left their land, often because of war or famine
rights restricted
at risk of being oppressed or taken advantage of
in need of protection
Perceived as a possible threat
Feared the Israelites




God’s solution: Hospitality
Reverent Worship + Compassion to Sojourners (Matthew 22)

Welcoming the Marginalized

Belong

[Notes]
welcome the sojourner, to invite him in, to treat the stranger as a guest
Matthew 22 to love God and love your neighbor as yourself
“The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God” (Leviticus 19:34)
warned not to neglect loving their neighbor for the sake of loving God
demonstrating not only a correlation between the two but also a recognition that when one cares for the marginalized, he is caring for Jesus himself 




Sojourners = The People of God
The Israelites
Christians (Parable of the Good Samaritan)


Welcoming the Marginalized

Belong

[Notes]
Sojourners in plural form used to refer to Isrealites
God mourns that His people were created for perfect communion with God and each other and to work alongside each other without toil: they are sojourners in the world mired by sin 

Jesus takes this a step further in the Parable of the Good Samaritan in Luke 10 by suggesting how Christ followers’ status as sojourners ought to influence their posture toward other sojourners.
Christ is asked “Who is my neighbor?” to which he answers that the Samaritan man is his neighbor and Christ followers are the man beaten and left half dead on the side of the road. The Church should love their neighbor because Jesus first saved and loved them.
Just as the Good Samaritan, Jesus paid the price for their salvation.  





We can empathize with the sojourner because we have been sojourners, and the Church ought to welcome the sojourner just as Jesus welcomed us

Welcoming the Marginalized

Belong

[Notes]
Christ followers have all been sojourners and they are all still sojourners



Share
In what ways have you been a sojourner, stranger, different, on the outside, alone, oppressed, in need of protection, etc.?



1:07

Belong




LGBT+ People are Sojourners
Alienated for being different
At risk of being mistreated
Verbally and physically abuse

Welcoming the Marginalized

Belong

[Notes]
Like the sojourner, LGBT+ people have experienced alienation for being different and not fitting in to culture that is predominantly heterosexual.
They are at risk of being mistreated and taken advantage of, frequently experiencing verbal and physical abuse with few willing to stand up and protect them.
LGBT+ people find themselves vulnerable, of lower social status, and susceptible to oppression.




Share
How might seeing LGBT+ people as sojourners impact your posture toward them?

How does seeing LGBT+ people as marginalized people needing empowerment change the way you minister to them?



1:14

Belong

[Notes]
Hospitality, grace, patience
Instead of seeing them as disobedient, sexually indulgent

NEED – to see LGBT+ people are marginalized people, stop the culture war, recognize the sin of the Church



BELONG


[Notes]
Once we develop empathy toward LGBT+ people
Developing a posture for welcoming marginalized people
How do we become a place where LGBT+ people can belong?




Application: BELONG
Be strategic like Christ
Jesus was aware of his audience
He treated religious people with power differently than the marginalized
Different responsibilities and message inside the Church versus outside





Belong

[Notes]
We are called to hold other Christians accountable in ways that would be inappropriate toward non-Christians.
And the Bible clearly states that those who are not Christians will find the teachings of Christ strange and offensive.
We can be strategic by conveying different messages inside the church versus outside of the church: the ways in which we are outwardly mission can be different than how we are inwardly missional. 



Application: BELONG
Be strategic like Christ
Two practical ways we can do this: don’t say dumb stuff + be consistent
Use term-mirroring, seek to understand LGBT+ culture, and eliminate problematic beliefs
Hold gay and straight people to    the same standards






Belong

[Notes]
We’re going to talk about both of these

Term mirroring – from preliminary materials
Understanding LGBT+ culture – WHY COME OUT
Eliminate problematic beliefs – sessions 2 and 3

Same standards: we will get to this more in session 2 as well, but don’t treat gay people differently. In particular, if you’re going to take sin seriously and block those in same-sex romantic relationships from being leaders or refuse to marry them, then you have to take other sin seriously too
Whether that be the rampant divorce and remarriage of straight Christians
Or the rampant greed, pride, pornography use, envy, obesity, anger, and laziness among Christians
I am an all of none kind of guy



Application: BELONG
A place where LGBT+ people can…
Worship, pray, and take communion together
Share meals and life together
Cry and celebrate together
Seek Christ together
Be as essential part of the work




Belong

[Notes]
What are LGBT+ people looking for? The same things everyone else is

NEED – do LGBT+ know they can find this at your church? Particularly LGBT+ teens?



Activity



Spend 5 minutes listing your physical, spiritual, and mental/emotional intimacy needs.
1:21

Belong

[Notes]
Want to explore how LGBT+ people can find community in the Body of Christ by exploring that need in all of us

You don’t have to share with anyone else



Share



Are all of these needs likely to be met in God alone? God plus a spouse alone?
1:27

Belong

[Notes]
Point out that we all need meaningful, spiritual friendship in addition to a relationship with God, regardless of whether we are married






Spiritual Friendship—what does it look like?
Let ourselves need others and give others permission to ask of our time/energy/etc.
Don’t hide from others—be vulnerable and trust others
Expect to get hurt and commit to forgive
Application: BELONG

Belong

[Notes]
Chosen family, spiritual kinship



Share



Why don’t we build spiritual friendships?
Afraid of being known and rejected
Can’t trust others to love us as well as we love them
Don’t want to need others or owe others anything
Want an easy out, to blame and break commitment


Belong



Share



What practical barriers are there?
People live alone and far away
We want the freedom to change friends, churches, and cities
1:34

Belong

[Notes]
without a Church that prioritizes and nurtures and facilitates and support intimate, spiritual friendship, it has died
and without a marriage commitment and without a Church that prioritizes, nurtures, facilitates, or supports, why would we take the risk of entering into this kind of spiritual friendship? 

we resolve that its safer to be alone than get hurt
the problem is that we still hurt if we are alone
and alone people get into all kinds of trouble
whether its sexual immorality outside of marriage
jumping into marriage for the wrong reasons
or finding that your spouse isn’t enough in marriage, leading to other forms of sexual immorality

NEED






What does this look like practically?
Live together
Go on vacation together
Sacrifice money, time, location, job, and other friends for each other
Treat each other like chosen family
Application: BELONG

Belong

[Notes]
Committing ourselves to spiritual friendship

Whole-church fellowship events
Small groups with people of a diversity of backgrounds, ages, relational statuses, etc.






We’ve done this before, and you don’t have to wait for your church.

Being a Church that does spiritual friendship well is good for married people, straight single people, and LGBT+ people.
Application: BELONG

Belong

[Notes]
I want you to know that there is hope
we, as Christians, have done this before
its written on our hearts, to live in community in the Body of Christ and enjoy spiritual friendship with each other

We can be a Church where we can all find intimate, meaningful companionship in friendship in the Body of Christ
its good for married people because instead of struggling to meet their intimacy needs in God and their spouse alone, they will have relationship and support from the Body of Christ
its good for straight people who will continue singleness for a lifetime because they can find companionship in the Body of Christ
and its good for LGBT people, whether they continue in singleness for a lifetime or marry someone of the opposite sex, they have a place in a Church that does spiritual friendship well




Share



What could this look like in your relationships?
How could this shape the message and programming of your community?
1:42

Belong

[Notes]
NEED – does your church value this depth of friendship and family in the body of Christ?

NEED – are single people thriving in this kind of community in your church?
