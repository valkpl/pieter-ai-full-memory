Family in the Church



& LGBT+ PEOPLE


[Notes]
We all need family
We are created for it
But finding family is particularly difficult for LGBT+ Christians seeking to steward their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic
How can our churches do this better? How can we as Christians leaders do this better?
That’s what we’re in for over the next hour



Pieter Valk of

[Notes]
Before we jump into that, I want to share with you a little about me
My name is Pieter Valk
I studied at Vanderbilt University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and Lipscomb University
I have my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and one day a week I meet with LGBT+ undergraduate students at a Christian university navigating questions of faith, sexuality, and identity

And the rest of the week, I’m the Executive Director of EQUIP
A team of missionary consultants committed to equipping the Church with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction
Or to put it another way
We partner with churches to help them become places where LGBT+ people can belong and thrive according to an orthodox Christian sexual ethic
In 4 years, we’ve trained more than 1700 Christian leaders at 20 churches, campus ministries, and Christian universities

Our hope is that if we work with enough churches in enough depth, the church we offer the next generation is one where children to hear their parents and pastors talk about sexuality in theologically accurate and compassionate ways. Then when, in late elementary school or early middle school, some children realize they are attracted to other boys and girls of the same sex, we hope they no longer respond with shame, fear, or hiding. Instead, they share with their parents and pastors and ask for their help because they have heard that God still loves them and has good things for them. 

This work matters to me because I’m a Christian, I am gay, and God calls me to steward that according to an orthodox Christian sexual ethic—that God calls all people to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex, or to put it another way, that there is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses
In light of that, I need intimate, committed family in the body of Christ, but I’ve struggled to find that
So this topic personally matters to me



Family in the Church



& LGBT+ PEOPLE


[Notes]
LGBT+ Christians like me are experiencing crippling loneliness in the Church (we see the symptoms of that in acting out of LGBT+ Christians trying to follow a traditional sexual ethic, LGBT+ Christians adopting a progressive sexual ethic, and LGBT+ people leaving the Church altogether)
some say the solution is to adopt a progressive sexual ethic (but we’ve seen the bad fruit of that too—most of my friends who adopted a progressive sexual ethic are no longer Christian, because if the Bible can’t tell you who God it, what’s the likelihood that the God of our imagination even exists?)
some say the problem is LGBT+ Christians aren’t trying hard enough or willing enough to accept their cross and suffering and sanctification (but we know that narratives like that only leads to depression and suicidality and that LGBT+ Christians in our churches are already taking on more suffering than the average Christian)
the solution is the Church embodying a traditional sexual ethic differently—truly embodying a Side B perspective
what does that look like?



A Better Church



Offer God’s narrative for sexual stewardship for all people
Talk about the reality of SSA among Christians
Start talking about this at an early age
Effectively minister to LGBT+ people
Become churches where people can thrive in celibacy and MOMs

[Notes]
we need to invite all people, gay and straight, to life-giving and often culturally inconvenient sexual stewardship
Most churches today lead straight Christians to assume they will get married, teach that we need romantic companionship to be happy, and ignore the Bible’s teachings about lifetime celibacy
This leads to huge divorce rates and a void of theology and practice of celibacy 
We need to teach that God first calls everyone to a period of abstinent singleness during which we discern whether we are called to a lifetime vocation of celibacy or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex
We need to teach that each of us has the capacity for either of those vocations and this should be an open question for every Christian, gay or straight
for too long we have called gay Christians to a high standard of sexual stewardship than straight Christians by allowing straight Christians to take marriage and misuse it for their romantic fulfillment while only asking gay Christians to consider lifetime celibacy

second, churches need to talk openly about the reality of same-sex attraction among Christians, how same-sex attraction develops, what part God played in that development and why, whether same-sex attraction can change, how to meet one’s intimacy needs, how LGBT+ people fit in God’s story, and how God’s invitation to LGBT+ people is good
Everyone in our church needs to be able to have healthy conversation around these questions so that they can love LGBT+ people well, and LGBT+ people still in the closet in your church will only hear these things and know it is safe to come out if you talk to everyone about this

third, we need to talk about same-sex attraction and the brokenness of all of our sexualities in age-appropriate ways across the lifespan
we cannot wait until someone comes out to talk about these things, because on average, a teen waits 5 years after first recognizing the SSA to talk to a parent or pastor—that’s 5 years that a teen makes sense of these questions alone if we don’t talk about them pre-emptively and demonstrate that our churches and homes are safe places to talk

fourth, pastors and lay leaders need to seek out the training to be able to competently and compassionately minister to LGBT+ people instead of shipping them offer to therapists and support groups away from the people they worship, pray, and take communion with

fifth and perhaps most importantly, churches need to become places where LGBT+ Christians can actually thrive in celibacy or a mixed-orientation marriage

This last point is what we’re gonna focus on today
But before we do that, I want to have some discussion about this vision as a whole

Gospel Importance



Why cultivate healthy celibacy and mixed-orientation marriages in your church?

The gospel depends on it: celibacy and mixed-orientation marriages embody the gospel

[Notes]
So today we are focusing on how your church can cultivate healthy celibacy and mixed-orientation marriages
Why is that so important?
We should take cultivating celibacy and mixed-orientation marriages in our churches seriously, because the gospel depends on it
For LGBT+ people, our relational vocations—whether we are called to celibacy or a mixed-orientation marriage—aren’t just about enjoying relationship. They are also one of the primary ways we embody the gospel
So our churches need to cultivate healthy celibacy and mixed-orientation marriages so that they reflect the beauty of God’s love and share the gospel effectively
Let me break that down



Gospel Importance



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matthew 19:3-12, Mark 10:2-12, Genesis 1:26-27)
Intimate (1 John 4:19)
Procreative (Genesis 1:28)
Faithful (Isaiah 54:6-8, Hosea 3:1)
Sacrificial (Ephesians 5:23, Galatians 6:2)
Hospitable (Luke 14, Leviticus 19)

[Notes]
God is a person in community, in family in the trinity
And 6 elements consistently describe the love found in God’s family



Gospel Importance



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

We are all created for family in the Body of Christ (Genesis 2, Leviticus 26:12) 

Family – a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other

[Notes]
Because we are created in God’s image, we are created for that same kind of love
we are all made for diverse, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment, sacrifice, and hospitality

And just like God, we are made to find that love inside of family

What do I mean when I use the word family? Well, how Jesus used it...




Gospel Importance



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matthew 19:3-12, Mark 10:2-12, Genesis 1:26-27)
Intimate (1 John 4:19)
Procreative (Genesis 1:28)
Faithful (Isaiah 54:6-8, Hosea 3:1)
Sacrificial (Ephesians 5:23, Galatians 6:2)
Hospitable (Luke 14, Leviticus 19)

[Notes]
Now its probably obvious how Christian marriage embodies these 6 elements of God’s love and create families
But the Church has historically taught and needs to return to the teaching that celibacy is just as much about enjoying diverse, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment, sacrifice, and hospitality
And celibacy is just as much a call to find this kind of love in the context of family

But, celibacy and Christian marriage aren’t just paths for enjoying relationship and family in the Body of Christ
They are images of God’s love for us
They embody each of those 6 aspects of God’s love, they reflect the love in the Trinity and between God and the Church, and celibacy uniquely points us to the hope of how we will all live in the New Heaven and New Earth
They preach the gospel and point us back to the thing they imitate: God’s love and God’s family
The practice of celibacy and Christian marriage (including mixed-orientation marriages) in our churches should be so beautiful that those who do not yet know Jesus want to draw close to them and get to know the Source of that love
When non-believers step into the homes of Christian marriages or celibate people living together as a family or a mixed family of celibate and married people, the love found there should help people believe that God loves them
And they should experience God’s love through those families



Gospel Importance



Unfortunately, few of our churches are places where LGBT+ people thrive in celibacy or mixed-orientation marriages, and that’s a problem.

Our churches must do what it takes, and it’s worth it, because the gospel depends on it
26

[Notes]
But the reality is, few of our churches are places where LGBT+ people thrive in celibacy or mixed-orientation marriages
And that’s a problem
Because when we fail to present the gospel accurately by negligence, we sin
When the church fails to do what it takes to be a place where the average LGBT+ person could thrive through reasonable effort, it sins
Our churches must do what it takes
I highlight all of this because I know it is going to take a lot of work on behalf of churches to become places where LGBT+ people can thrive in celibacy or mixed-orientation marriage
And it is worth the work
Because LGBT+ people are worth it
And the gospel depends on it

let me say that a little differently
helping LGBT+ people thrive in celibacy or a mixed-orientation marriage is just as important of a gospel initiative
as mission trips
as community outreach
as praise songs
as youth ministry
as the sermon
and they should get as much attention

so if we gave them that attention
if we rightly spent our energies there
what would it look like?
let’s get really practical
how can your church cultivate celibacy and mixed-orientation marriages?

Pause for questions or comments before I go on




THRIVING


[Notes]
For the rest of our time, we’re going to talk about 5 practical steps your church can take to cultivate celibacy
And 4 practical steps your church can take to cultivate mixed-orientation marriages

I want to note that these steps don’t just apply to celibacy and Christian marriage involving LGBT+ people
Taking these steps will help your churches become places where all people, gay or straight, can thrive in celibacy and marriage



Thriving in Celibacy



Model it – 
To imagine a future that is good and valued, children must see celibate people thriving and leading

[Notes]
Celibacy must be modeled in our churches

we can only imagine a future for ourselves that we see modeled
we will only imagine that future as good and valuable if it is modeled as being such
so the children in our churches need to see celibate people in our churches thriving
the children in our churches need to see celibate people in places of leadership, upfront, honored



Thriving in Celibacy



Teach it – 
Across the lifespan, we must share the rich theology of celibacy in Scripture

[Notes]
We need to teach children in our churches about the rich theology of celibacy in Scripture
every time we talk about marriage, we need to talk about celibacy



Thriving in Celibacy



Teach it – 

The example of our faith, Jesus, was celibate

He told a crowd Jewish people who were commanded to marry and procreate to consider celibacy


[Notes]
The example of our faith, Jesus, was celibate
He talked about marriage and celibacy in countercultural ways
He told a crowd Jewish people who were commanded to marry and procreate to consider celibacy



Thriving in Celibacy



Teach it – 

He lifted up celibacy from being an exceptional vocation for only a few to an equally normative calling for the average Christian



Thriving in Celibacy



Teach it – 

Then Christ’s death established a new covenant where marriage was no longer necessary to fulfill God’s promises because we join God’s family by Christ’s work on the cross, not birth into a Jewish family



Thriving in Celibacy



Teach it – 

Christ’s resurrection started the work of bringing about the New Heaven and the New Earth where we will all be celibate

And Paul’s teachings confirm and strengthen these ideas


[Notes]
Celibacy is a blessing to the church
It is the first fruits of the New Heaven and the New Earth
And it is available to all of us—every one of us has the capacity to do it–we merely wait for God’s call



Thriving in Celibacy



Discern it – 
Invite teens to listen for God’s call and accept it joyfully

[Notes]
Help teens in your church discern whether they are called to celibacy or marriage

as we teach children and teens how to think theologically about their sexual stewardship and relational vocation, we need to also invite them to discern that
with parents, with mentors, in prayer and Scripture with the Holy Spirit
in teens and 20s and perhaps beyond, dancing with God to discover His call for you
because its going to take 10% of straight Christians accepting their call for many churches to actually prioritize supporting celibacy people



Thriving in Celibacy



Support it – 
Help celibate people stay in, join, or build family in the body of Christ

[Notes]
Support celibate people by helping them find family

in general, help them have a better experience of family in the body of Christ
bigger church fellowship
multiple phase of life small groups
but as we’ve noted, celibate people need intimate, spiritually procreative, and covenant-bound relationships that are maintained through sacrifice
help them find their inner family



Thriving in Celibacy



Support it – 
Stay with biological family?
Join another nuclear family?
Create families of celibate people?

[Notes]
stay with biological family

knit into marriages (celibates as Godparents) (calling families to include in rhythms, vacations, holidays, living)

help create families of their own
people need to be given a vision of it and called to it
provide incubator where risk is reduced (subsidize it)
give instructions to make it happen
For example, a group of 8 guys and I in Nashville are discerning whether God has called us to start an ecumenical monastery for men committed to celibacy where we would take vows committing to do life together for the rest of our lives



Thriving in Celibacy



Celebrate it – 
Find ways to mark and celebrate the commitments and milestones of celibate people

[Notes]
Celebrate the lives of celibate people

mother’s day, father’s day, anniversaries, marriages, engagement parties, baptism, baby showers
what for celibates? how do we mark and celebrate their commitment?

Thriving in MOMs




Normalize them – 
They are common and beautiful for those called to them

[Notes]
define

pendulum over past few decades
80s, 90s, and early 00s - everyone needs to marry + pray the gay away
late 00s, 10s - reaction to failures, everyone needs to be celibate

don't pressure people into them: doesn’t work for everyone
what the bible has to say about celibacy

don’t discredit: we only hear about the ones that fail

when it’s done well
talk about it before engagement (recognize that it will always be a part of marriage—it returns, work of Satan)
talk about it in marriage
talk about it with other couples
opinions of secular sex therapists: recipe for marital satisfaction and sexual satisfaction is emotional intimacy + commitment (sexual attraction not necessary)

So as a result

talk about them and normalize them
Talk about celibacy and MOMs as equally good options for those who experience same-sex attraction. Make sure teens who experience same-sex attraction know God could call them to that. And normalize them—recognize that they exist and will be beautiful for some.




Thriving in MOMs




Teach accurately about marriage – 
Marriage is about emotional intimacy, vulnerability, commitment, and raising children together

[Notes]
talk about what marriage is and isn’t:
If marriage is primarily about sexual attraction and companionship, then perhaps MOMs won’t work
But if it’s about emotional intimacy and vulnerability, commitment, and raising children together, then they can thrive



Thriving in MOMs




Amplify their stories – 
Encourage them to share about the beauty and brokenness of their marriages

[Notes]
Amplify the stories of MOMs in your church, if they are willing to share, and show both the beauty and brokenness
Encourage MOMs in your congregation to share with their pastor and/or small group



Thriving in MOMs




Cultivate celibacy – 
Right theology and viable practice of celibacy will lead to healthier motivations for entering into MOMs 

[Notes]
cultivate a healthy theology and practice of celibacy—
A lot of the friends I have that were in mixed orientation marriages that fell apart or are in a really rough spot, its because the gay person didn’t feel like they had any other option
They didn’t feel like celibacy was a viable option
So they told God, “I’ll give this a chance and do my best because it’s my only option, but if this blows up, it’s on you”
much of the pain experienced in MOMs has come from our churches’ idolotry of marriage—and one of the causes of that has been the lack of right theology and practice of celibacy to return celibacy and marriage to their correct balance
