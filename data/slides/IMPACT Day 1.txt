[Notes]

Our Mission
To equip the Church with the understanding and skills to better love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction






Our Results
4 Churches + 2 Universities + 4 Campus Ministries
740 Christian Leaders for 1930 hours of training
92% feel better prepared to minister to sexual minorities
94% found training to be effective or very effective
99% feel more ready to be a friend to sexual minorities






Our Vision
We want the Church we leave our children to be one where boys and girls grow up hearing their parents, friends, and pastors talk about sexuality in compassionate and meaningful ways. And if those boys and girls find themselves attracted to other boys or girls of the same sex, we want them to be able to share with their parents, friends, or pastors without fear or shame.




[Notes]
why do we do this? why does this vision matter to me?
My story: experiencing same-sex attraction and reconciling that with traditional Christian beliefs that God calls all people to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
I felt that alone, afraid, shame, dirty in middle school when I started to realize my attractions
Prayed daily that God would fix me, make me normal, make me straight
I didn’t have parents or a church around me where I thought it was safe
Got to college and took the risk of fully known and fully loved
As I made sense of my story and did life with others who experience same-sex attraction, realized my parents and church didn’t know how to speak to my experience or minister to me because they were never taught
And their silence on this topic was out of fear of saying the wrong thing and a lack of confidence
That’s why EQUIP does what it does: so that the Church can have that understanding and skills and confidence to put them into practice



First Lesson: Listen
Listen to the stories of LGBT+ people in your life
Empathize with their experiences
Nurture your compassion for their struggles



DEEP DIVE

[Notes]
Which leads us to our first and perhaps most important lesson: Listen

Foundation of any ministry
convicted civility (truth and love)

Deep dive: familiarity with stories and biblical posture toward marginalized



Turn & Talk
What have your experiences been doing life with people among your friends, family, and coworkers that experience same-sex attraction?

My Beliefs



Experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin (Matthew 6:12-13; James 1:14-15; Hebrews 4:15)

Same-sex romantic/sexual activity is a sin (Romans 1; Leviticus 18:22; Leviticus 20:13; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10)

God does not promise that a person’s same-sex attraction will change in this lifetime

[Notes]
to be transparent, provide words for those who believe similarly, and encourage to interact with ideas if believe differently

Bible
Experiences (personal and others)
Church Tradition
Science (counseling and bad fruit)
Apostolic succession



My Beliefs



We do not choose who we are attracted to, but we choose how we respond

Any sin can separate us from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all (John 10:28-30; Romans 8:38-39; Ephesians 4:30)

God promises transformation of the heart and provision of fullness to anyone who seeks Him faithfully (Ezekiel 36:26)



My Beliefs



God calls the Church to love those who experience SSA regardless of what their journeys look like (Hebrews 13; Acts 2: 42-47)

God loves LGBT+ people and He values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-31)

God-honoring Sexuality:

MANY STORIES.
ONE NARRATIVE.




[Notes]
God created us as sexual people 
Beautiful when enjoyed in contexts that God has blessed 
Destructive when engaged in outside of those contexts 
If God is truly the Lord of our life, we will seek to honor him with our sexuality 

But as many of you know, we don’t all have the same story or the same challenges 
There is a diversity of experiences in the Body of Christ 
One set of stories that get a lot of attention more broadly in our culture but we still don’t talk about much are those who experience same-sex attraction 

Part of the hesitation has been that it seems like the ways we talk about sexual stewardship for most people and the mentoring skills we use with most people don’t seem to apply with those who experience same-sex attraction 
If we need a different set of skills and a separate conversation or sex-talk-night for the youth group for every difference story, that’s just too much 




Training Goal
To discover one narrative for God-honoring sexual stewardship that sufficiently speaks to the many stories among your youth, including those who experience same-sex attraction
To equip you with the understanding and skills to minister to those who experience same-sex attraction






Before we start: Focus
Will NOT be exhaustive

Will provide:
Correct Questions
Deep Understanding
Practical Skills






Before we start: Focus



Next steps:		Partner with EQUIP?




Personal Discovery and Application
Your part:

[Notes]
Your part is to continue your personal discovery in this area and consider how to apply this training in your context
I will provide some suggestions for further reading and resources
Some of you might want to partner with EQUIP to help you deepen your understanding and apply this training

intense/taking from a water hose
take notes

At the end will share about opportunity to submit your questions for us to address on Friday
pastoral counseling invite




Before we start: Gender
Our focus will be God’s call to sexual stewardship and how to minister to those who experience same-sex attraction

Gender identity questions are not the same as sexual identity questions and one does not necessarily lead to the other



DEEP DIVE

[Notes]
focus on same-sex attraction, not talk about gender 



Before we start: Terms
Lots of options and no perfect term

Use whatever vocabulary you are most comfortable with






Before we start: Terms
Experience Same-Sex Attraction
Gay
Sexual Minority
Queer
Gay Celibate Christian
Side A + Side B




[Notes]
reference terms sheet, read aloud, don’t have to agree with definitions



Before we start: Terms
Our vocabulary can be a source of hesitation or a barrier to relationship

Practice compassion by mirroring the terms another uses
How do you identify?
What does that term mean to you?



22

[Notes]
term mirroring) 
language and terms is a first way we can be compassionate (using sensitive language and respecting others’ identification)



Turn & Talk



Which of these terms are new to you?
Which are you most comfortable with?
What barriers do you feel to term-mirroring?

None of us are how God made us to be
Neither born gay nor chose to be gay

[Notes]
corrupted at genetic level and raised in broken world
Twins and hormone studies inconclusive, suggestion predisposition
Not genetically determined

Deep Knowledge



How does same-sex attraction develop?
Equifinality: multiple pathways to the same outcome 
Multifinality: group of people with same factors have different outcomes 
DEEP DIVE

[Notes]
List factors briefly: can go into more depth in a workshop dedicated to this
Predisposing factors - genetic predisposition, physical composition, emotional disposition  
Precipitating factors - sexual abuse, unhealthy relationship with the same or opposite sex parent, broken view of gender
Perpetuating factors - sexualization, continued gender incongruence, psychological vulnerability, rejection and shame



Deep Knowledge



How does same-sex attraction develop?
Understanding developmental factors may help an individual gain acceptance but should not be addressed with the goal of “fixing” the individual



Deep Knowledge



Does same-sex attraction change?
There is no promise of change in attractions
Some will experience change and some will not, but not as a reflection of how hard we want it or work at it



Deep Knowledge



What part did God play and why?
Does God make people gay?
Give people over to “a depraved mind”?
Allow people to develop same-sex attraction?
Play no part?



Deep Knowledge



What part did God play and why?
Did not intend for anyone to be gay or make anyone gay (James 1:13)
We are all corrupted at a genetic level and grow up in a broken world (Psalm 51:5)
God allowed it to happen (Romans 5:12)



Deep Knowledge



What part did God play and why?
If God protected us from the consequences of our actions and the actions of others, would we really have choice?
God seeks to redeem all brokenness for our good and His glory (Romans 8:28)

[Notes]
Question of Evil
No good answer



Deep Knowledge



How does God see me?
He’s not surprised, and He sees you as valuable (Psalm 139)
We are all broken and accepted before a gracious and merciful God who will never abandon us (Colossians 2:9-10)



Parting Question



What might it look like to explore these questions in your youth group or with your children?
