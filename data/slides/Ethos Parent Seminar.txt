Personal story

why we need to personally think about this well
so that we can love LGBT+ friends well
so that we can help our straight children love their LGBT+ friends well
and so that we can love our LGBT+ children well
(continually point back this for application)

for those of you who will have LGBT+ children
give space for you to mourn brokenness
but also give you hope that God still has good things for them and you can help them do this well



Turn & Talk
What have your experiences been doing life with people among your friends, family, and coworkers who experience same-sex attraction?

Before we start: Beliefs



Experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin (Matthew 6:12-13; James 1:14-15; Hebrews 4:15)

Same-sex romantic/sexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19; Romans 1; Leviticus 18:22; Leviticus 20:13; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10; 1 Timothy 1:8-10)

God does not promise that a person’s same-sex attraction will change in this lifetime (Philippians 3:12)

[Notes]
These are my personal beliefs and the beliefs of the ministers here at Ethos






We do not choose who we are attracted to, but we choose how we respond (Hebrews 4:15)

Any sin can separate us from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all (John 10:28-30; Romans 8:38-39; Ephesians 4:30)

God promises transformation of the heart and provision of fullness to anyone who seeks Him faithfully (Ezekiel 36:26)
Before we start: Beliefs






God calls the Church to love those who experience SSA regardless of what their journeys look like (Hebrews 13; Acts 2: 42-47)

God loves LGBT+ people and He values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-31)
Before we start: Beliefs



Before we start: Gender
Our focus will be God’s call to sexual stewardship and how to minister to those who experience same-sex attraction

Gender identity questions are not the same as sexual identity questions and one does not necessarily lead to the other






Before we start: Terms
Lots of options and no perfect term

Use whatever vocabulary you are most comfortable with






Turn & Talk



Which of these terms/definitions are new to you or problematic?
Side A vs. B vs. X—which does Ethos believe and embody?
What barriers do you feel to term-mirroring?
34

[Notes]
I’ve provided a list of terms I might use today and what I mean when I use those terms

You don’t have to agree with my definitions
Gay vs. homosexual vs. same-sex attracted vs. queer vs. LGBT+ person
Encourage not to use homosexual
Recognize why SSA can be problematic
Talk about why a Side B Christian with SSA might want to identify as gay

DEVELOPMENT







Adolescence is a time of Physical, Cognitive, and Social Development

Teens are asking questions:
Who am I?
Where do I belong?
Sexual Identity Development

[Notes]
No less true for SSA
Doesn’t have to be more challenging for SSA if we provide understanding + tools to navigate well and we support them well
We will see that we cannot wait until a teen comes out to us to provide this understanding and tools

Info from Mark Yarhouse book



Sexual Identity Development



Recognize they experience same-sex attraction and are different than peers

Same-sex sexual behavior

Label oneself as gay/lesbian/bisexual

Ongoing relationship with the same sex

Disclosure to another person
12 - 14
16 - 17
17 - 18
15 - 18
17 - 18

[Notes]
What do you notice about all of these?
milestones happen in high school
college is too late!
parents dont know what they’re doing!
Disclosure is often the last step or at least after recognizing one’s attractions, experimenting, and having a first same-sex relationship






Because milestones occur before disclosure, parenting cannot be reactive:
Preemptively talk about these questions and provide answers
Build trust and openness with how we talk about this topic
Be patient as teens make sense of these questions when they do share
Impact on parenting?

[Notes]
So how should this information impact your parenting?






What do SSA teens need to hear before they come out?
God’s narrative of sexual stewardship for all people
How that’s good for SSA students

Impact on parenting?

[Notes]
what do teens need to hear before they come out?

If all they hear is that God is against homosexuality, we are setting up the children in our church to either embrace homosexuality or to struggle with deep shame, loneliness, depression, and suicidality, OR BOTH
This has been my experience in my own life and the lives of others

We need to offer them something good, something better, something compelling, something they can say “yes” to

They need to hear how God has called us to steward our sexualities
They need to hear what that means for people who experience same-sex attraction, how that is good for them, and how they still fit in God’s family
They need to hear the answers to the big questions: how same-sex attraction develops, what part God played and why, how one should identify, how to have healthy relationships, etc.
In doing all of this, you need to demonstrate that you are someone they can trust, and you need to specifically and repeatedly invite them to share with you and/or their parents if same-sex attraction is a part of their story

THEOLOGY


[Notes]
How can we talk about SSA in theologically accurate and compassionate ways?
In particular, I want to model how you can share God’s narrative for sexual stewardship for all people with teens like I mentioned earlier
Then I’ll highlight what that means for people who experience same-sex attraction, how that is good for them, and how they still fit in God’s family




Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of abstinent singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to lifelong marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Others called to lifelong celibacy and intimate family in the Body of Christ

[Notes]
Here is my summary of God’s narrative for sexual stewardship




Created for Love



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matthew 19:3-12, Mark 10:2-12, Genesis 1:26-27)
Intimate (1 John 4:19)
Procreative (Genesis 1:28)
Faithful (Isaiah 54:6-8, Hosea 3:1)
Sacrificial (Ephesians 5:23, Galatians 6:2)

[Notes]
We need to start by looking at who God is and how He loves



Created for Love



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

Sexuality – our need for relationship, to know and be known, to give and receive that kind of love

[Notes]
A - we are all made for diverse, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment and sacrifice

B - and because we are mind, body, and spirit, we need connection on cognitive, physical, and spiritual levels



Created for Love



We are all created for family in the Body of Christ (Genesis 2, Leviticus 26:12) 

Family – a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other

Neither sex nor marriage is promised or necessary to meet our intimacy needs

[Notes]
but where and how we find that may look different depending on whether we are called to celibacy or marriage



Created for Love



None of us can meet our intimacy needs fully or finally in this lifetime (Isaiah 59:2)

If we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, our flesh will reach out for destructive and unsatisfying alternatives (1 Corinthians 7:1-40)



Our first calling



A period of abstinent singleness
Enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ
Called to neither lifelong celibacy nor marriage
Submit our sexuality to God, study the Scriptures, discern with God and others

[Notes]
A - What are we called to? How do we meet our intimacy needs?

B - We should not assume that we are called to marriage just because we have sexual desires, want to be a parent, or find abstinent singleness to be too challenging. 



Turn & Talk



We are all created for family, yet neither sex nor marriage is promised or necessary to meet our intimacy needs. How can that be so?
What might this discernment process look like?
Does God allow people to have significant sexual desires, a desire to be a parent, and allow them to struggle with abstinent singleness yet call them to a lifetime of celibacy? How is that good?



What’s the Bible say…



…about celibacy and marriage?
Matthew 19:8-12
Better to be celibate if cannot accept what Christian marriage is
We do not choose celibacy or marriage, we are called

[Notes]
So what does the Bible say about celibacy and marriage?
Highlight two big passages in this conversation

In Matthew 19:8-12, Jesus calls married people to a deeper level of commitment to each other. 

He recognizes that for those who cannot make this level of commitment, it would be better for them not to marry. 
Some have been called to marriage, others have been called to celibacy. 
To illustrate this point, Jesus compares our experience to that of a eunuch—a person who refrains from sex and is not married. 
He notes that some are this way because of how they are born (genital defects); that some are made eunuchs by others (referring to genital mutilation, enslavement, and any other involuntary process); and that others choose this lifestyle (choose lifelong celibacy). 

Importantly, Jesus recognizes that celibacy is not always chosen and that some who are called to celibacy are called involuntarily.



What’s the Bible say…



…about celibacy and marriage?
1 Corinthians 1: 7-8, 32-25
Preference for celibacy
Marriage will be a gift to those who are called to it

[Notes]
In 1 Corinthians 1: 7 and 8, Paul recommends that Christians refrain from sex and not marry. 

He communicates a preference for celibacy and a desire that all would be celibate, but he recognizes that all are not called to celibacy. 

Paul recognizes that for those who are called to marriage, that will be a gift as well. 
Continuing in verses 32 through 35, he advocates for celibacy because the concern of the celibate is not divided between God and one’s spouse and children.

The New Testament strongly encourages celibacy and recognizes that celibacy is given, not chosen—some will find themselves called to celibacy despite their personal preference.
The New Testament allows for marriage for those who are called to it, recognizing that marriages provides a vision of Christ’s relationship with the Church that ministers to both those who are married and those who are celibate.
Nevertheless, the Bible recognizes that marriage is difficult and should be entered into cautiously. 
Ultimately, the Bible comes up just short of calling all people to celibacy, but it also reprimands the person who assumes he or she will be married.




Called to Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime vocation between a man and a woman to enjoy intimacy, raise children for the Body of Christ, and embody the gospel for each other and the world

[Notes]
Let’s talk about these two vocations practically



Called to Marriage



How does marriage embody the gospel?
Complementary of the genders/sexes both psychologically and biologically reflect the Trinity and Christ’s relationship with the Church
Intimate – sexually, emotionally, and spiritually



Called to Marriage



How does marriage embody the gospel?
Procreative – raise children
Faithful – lifetime commitment
Sacrificial – of personal desires and preferences

[Notes]
those called to marriage will thrive when they seek to fulfill these purposes
Churches must teach accurately about what marriage is and support families to keep their vows and raise children



Turn & Talk



Jesus and Paul validate celibacy as normative and beautiful. How do we square that with the low frequency of celibate people in our churches and the high place marriage holds?



Called to Celibacy



Celibacy is NOT a call to loneliness for the sake of the gospel

Celibacy IS a call to diverse, intimate, and spiritually procreative relationships that are maintained by commitment and sacrifice



Called to Celibacy



Unique benefits:
Deeper friendship
Greater possibility for spiritual parenthood, church leadership, and healing of broken families
Can take greater risks for the gospel



Called to Celibacy



Providing spaces for celibates to thrive is part of the Church’s DNA
Honor and support celibacy in practical and structural ways
Embrace and thrive in the calling
Celibacy and marriage are equal with different advantages and challenges

[Notes]
doing celibacy well was easy in a time and place where everyone lived in multi-family, multi-generational homes
but the wealth of our society has made that uncommon, if not weird
so how do we do this in a modern context?
we need a new narrative for this, a modern narrative for a modern problem
yet we aren’t without examples—creating space for celibate people dates back to the early church
the gospel called people to have one wife, which led to many widows
in Acts 6, the church accepted the responsibility to create space for those widows and provide for them
that is in the DNA of the Church

For those called to celibacy, the Church must honor and support that calling in practical and structural ways so that they can meet their intimacy needs in healthy ways.

Those who find themselves in continued celibacy, despite their desire to be married (whether because they are not yet married, widowed, divorced), will benefit from accepting their present circumstances, embracing their current calling, and learning to thrive in it.
These individuals may find it comforting (or discouraging) that Jesus recognized that some will be called to celibacy involuntarily but should accept and embrace their circumstances nonetheless.

We must recognize and teach that celibacy and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges.



Turn & Talk



How can celibate people enjoy family in the Body of Christ? What are the greatest challenges to realizing that?

[Notes]
When done well, those called to celibacy enjoy companionship in intimate, committed relationships that is as fulfilling as marriage.



Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of abstinent singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to lifelong marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Others called to lifelong celibacy and intimate family in the Body of Christ

[Notes]
Here is my summary of God’s narrative for sexual stewardship

God offers relationship with Him and the Body of Christ as the solution to loneliness
Spiritual friendship is a satisfying source of companionship available to all
Marriage is a vocation for the purpose of raising children
God calls many to a flourishing life of celibacy
All enjoy deep friendship in the Body of Christ and support each other in their vocations



Why does it matter?



Both are about embodying the gospel:
Diverse, intimate, and procreative relationships maintained by commitment and sacrifice point to the Trinity and Christ + the Church
Celibacy reflects Christ’s life and future patterns in the New Heaven and New Earth

[Notes]
why is Christian orthodoxy about sexual stewardship important?



What does Scripture say?



Preponderance of Biblical support

Same-sex sexual activity is sin (Genesis 19; Romans 1; Leviticus 18:22; Leviticus 20:13; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10; 1 Timothy 1:8-10) 

Marriage defined between man and women (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-5) 

Context of rape, incest, adultery, or sex outside of marriage (Genesis 19:1-9) 

Written for a people in a time and place

[Notes]
So what does all of this mean for those who experience same-sex attraction?
Let’s take a look at the verses people typically reference on this topic and why I feel like we need more

Preponderance, but not certainty

That’s why we need this more robust narrative of sexual stewardship for all people





Applying God’s narrative
Same-sex attraction is not God’s intention and is a result of the Fall
Same-sex sexual/romantic activity is sinful
God does not bless same-sex marriages because they fall outside of God’s design for marriage
There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses




[Notes]
We don’t even need to clobber passages to arrive at 3 and 4, which highlights that regardless of debate around their specific meaning, the broader narrative of scripture does not bless same-sex marriage



How is this good?



If the Church did this well, it would be a place where those who experience SSA could thrive in celibacy or a mixed orientation marriage (MOM)

Their callings would be just as beautiful and the challenges would be no greater

[Notes]
what does that mean for those who experience SSA?
and why does God’s narrative for sexual stewardship matter to us?

celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex (just like straight people!)
I can imagine yall have a lot of thoughts and feelings about MOMs

church where celibacy taught and valued and just as good
other straight people celibate and thriving
church that recognizes brokenness and talks about brokenness of sexuality
also recognizes what marriage really is
so can thrive in MOM

everyone enjoys meaningful community in the Body of Christ



Turn & Talk
What about this narrative is challenging?
How could you communicate this to your children?
How is this narrative good and beautiful and compelling for LGBT+ people?

MINISTER


[Notes]
7 questions
creating space for questions, helping think well, and listening well 
don’t expect you to answer questions for them



Ministering: Core Q’s



How does same-sex attraction develop?
None of us are how God made us to be
Neither born gay nor chose to be gay

[Notes]
corrupted at genetic level and raised in broken world
Twins and hormone studies inconclusive, suggestion predisposition
Not genetically determined
Not chosen
Parents, it’s not your fault




Ministering: Core Q’s



How does same-sex attraction develop?
Understanding developmental factors may help an individual gain acceptance but should not be addressed with the goal of “fixing” the individual

[Notes]
For me this was helpful because it wasn’t a mystery anymore.
My experience also breaks the duality—it doesn’t fit in the culture war




Ministering: Core Q’s



Will my same-sex attraction change?
There is no promise of change in attractions
Some will experience change and some will not, but not as a reflection of how hard we want it or work at it

[Notes]
I have experienced a decrease in frequency and magnitude of my same-sex attractions
But still a daily challenge, I expect it always will be
I’ve moved on from asking God to change this, and that has been really healthy for me
False hope in my life was very destructive for a long time




Ministering: Core Q’s



What part did God play and why?
Did not intend for anyone to be gay or make anyone gay (James 1:13) 
We are all corrupted at a genetic level and grow up in a broken world (Psalms 51:5) 
God allowed it to happen        (Romans 5:12)

[Notes]
Does God make people gay?
Give people over to “a depraved mind”?
Allow people to develop same-sex attraction?
Play no part?

If God protected us from the consequences of our actions and the actions of others, would we really have choice?
God seeks to redeem all brokenness for our good and His glory (Romans 8:28) 

Question of Evil
No good answer





Ministering: Core Q’s



Who am I in light of what I am feeling?
Name and affirm experience while encouraging delayed identification
Distinguish between attractions, orientation, identity, and behavior
Radical acceptance: acknowledge and commit to work through

[Notes]
I am a child of God, first and foremost
And I accept that same-sex attraction is a part of my story
And it has significantly impacted my journey and how I see the world
What do I do with that? How do I label that?

For me, it has been helpful to identify as a gay Christian
Shared heritage
Similar life experiences
Unique perspective in the Body of Christ
Still secondary and operated by my identity in Christ
In Heaven, with bind some but divide none







What do I do with all of this shame?
Satan’s primary weapon
Our response:
Identify, Reject, & Replace
Share
Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
When we tell people to hide their attractions
Not to talk about them
Don’t allow them to identify around them in any way
When we blame people for reaching out for forbidden things from their loneliness
We heap on the shame







 How do I meet my intimacy needs?
What are my needs?
Normalize
Jesus: angels in the wilderness and disciples in Gethsemane
Stewardship of meeting in healthy ways

Ministering: Core Q’s






 How do I meet my intimacy needs?
Same-sex attractions are unmet needs for healthy same-sex intimacy that have been sexualized
Seek healthy relationships with safe friends

Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
Encourage healthy relationships with others

My life got better when I stopped ignoring my loneliness and started meeting my needs in healthy ways with deep friendship
And to this day, if I am struggling with lust, instead of shaming myself, I want my first response to be asking myself whether I have been meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways (which I haven’t)







 What does the future look like?
A lifetime of sanctification and sexual stewardship
Intimacy with God and His family and working to redeem the world
Obedience to God’s teachings and surrendering our brokenness to God will bring goodness (Jeremiah 7:23)
Ministering: Core Q’s






 What does the future look like?
God invites everyone to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Both are equally good and available to those who experience same-sex attraction
Ministering: Core Q’s

[Notes]
A lot of my depression came from this feeling that my future would only contain continued suffering. 
As a child, I was led to believe that a wife and kids are what would make me most happy. And society tells me that if I only had a relationship with a guy I am attracted to, I would be most happy.
But my attractions and beliefs make none of those an option
So you can see how it would be easy to despair
It wasn’t until I rejected those “promises” as false and learned what God really offers that I saw that my life can be just as beautiful as anyone else’s (if the Church does a better job of supporting celibates and MOMs)

APPLICATION




What NOT to Say 
Limit conversation about sexuality to demonizing gay sex and people
Ignore opportunities for conversation because you feel uncomfortable or ill-equipped
Neglect from educating yourself about the topic
Let your children see your negative reactions
Entirely pass the responsibility of ministry off to someone else






[Notes]
all I heard from family and church was God is against homosexuality
when gay people came on TV, my parents said very derogatory things
had no reason to believe either would respond well
never talked about being Christian and having SSA
thought it was my fault and I wasn’t praying hard enough
when caught me watching gay porn, didn’t talk to me about it being gay because didn’t want to believe I was gay
when an incident came up with another guy, blamed in on the other guy being gay and still didnt want to believe I was gay
ignored the conversation and waited for me to bring it up
didn’t seek out resources for themselves
showed me their mourning and confusion
shipped me off to a therapist
talked about fighting it and becoming straight and wanting grandkids

instead
talk about it before you have any reason to believe they might be gay
normalize same-sex attractions and celibacy
clarify important theological ideas (cause, choice, chance, brokenness, future possibilities, shame)
recognize that there are faithful Christians who continue to experience SSA
don’t run away from the conversation and initiate
grieve, process, and learn on your own—seek out counseling without son
give time to make sense of this for themselves—call them to certain standard and share hope they land there on their own and help them get there




Sharing with Teens
Today we had a conversation about sexuality and how we as Christians can steward our sexualities in God-honoring ways. In particular, we talked about same-sex attraction: when a boy likes another boy or a girl likes another girl. I want you to know that we are all broken—none of us are how God intended us to be. If one day you realize that you are attracted to other boys/girls like you, I want you to know…
You don’t choose who you are attracted to
You’re not alone and you don’t have to make sense of this alone
You don’t need to feel ashamed—it’s not your fault
God doesn’t love you any less and He has great plans for you
I’m not going to try to make you straight
Please let me in and let me walk through that with you.




[Notes]
Josh:

circle of truth
sharing story in age-appropriate ways
conversations happen at inconvenient times
never promote shame




Navigating Differences



Ask to submit decisions to traditional sexual ethic (for now)

Patiently walk with your teen as the Holy Spirit reveals why that ethic is good, beautiful, and true






Because milestones occur before disclosure, parenting cannot be reactive:
Preemptively talk about these questions and provide answers
Build trust and openness with how we talk about this topic
Be patient as teens make sense of these questions when they do share
Impact on parenting?

[Notes]
So how should this information impact your parenting?

QUESTIONS?




Final Take-Aways
Keep learning yourself
Open the door for conversation with your teens
Trust God






Scenario 1
They give you some reason to think they might be gay (gay porn, texting conversation with same-sex friend that seems romantic, admitting gay to someone else, another friend or parent tells you, LGBT media, asking lots of questions about what you believe about LGBT stuff, etc.)




[Notes]

don’t ignore
don’t assume
share with them what you know, what that might mean
what you think about all of this
and invite them to talk about it



Scenario 2
Your teen comes out to you as gay and believes God blesses same-sex marriages




[Notes]
come out to you as gay and believe God blesses same-sex marriages
assure them of your love
share what you believe
but say before you get into all of that, want to hear their story, pains, fears, and hopes from the past that has been unshared
ask them questions about what they believe and why—get more info



Scenario 3
Your teen comes out to you as gay and wants help with the attraction and do not believe same-sex marriage is God’s intention.
