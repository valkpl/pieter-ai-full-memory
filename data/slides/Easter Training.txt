LOVING

SEXUAL MINORITIES




[Notes]
welcome and thank you for being a part of serve our city Sunday
today, we will be learning how to better love sexual minorities so that we can go back to our family, friends, and coworkers who are sexual minorities and love them better

my name is Pieter Valk
I am the executive director of EQUIP Nashville
we want to equip Christians in Nashville to better love sexual minorities
here’s a video to give you a sense of what we do and why we do it

[Notes]
As Brandon mentioned, we’ve been doing that work here at Ethos training pastors, intern, and house church leaders
and we’ve been working at Lipscomb University training staff, faculty, and student leaders

And I care about this because this is my story
experiences same-sex attraction since middle school
wrestled with how to reconcile my attractions and my Christian faith
found a Christian community in college that was a safe space for me to share my story, invite my friends into my life, and ask the big questions
I came to the conclusion that romantic or sexual relationships with other guys wasn’t for me
And I committed my life to serving men and women like me who experience same-sex attraction

my dream is that in the future, little boys and little girls that grow up in the church will hear their parents and pastors and friends speak in meaningful and compassionate ways about sexuality
so that in late elementary school or early middle school when some of those boys and girls realize they are attracted to people of the same sex
they’re gut reaction won’t be fear or shame
instead they will feel comfortable telling their parents and talking about it with their pastor and sharing with their friends




LOVING

SEXUAL MINORITIES




[Notes]
we’re here today
you’re here today
because you have family, friends, or coworkers that are sexual minorities
you’ve heard their stories of fear and shame and pain
and you want to do something about it

and I’ve invited you here because this work is bigger than me
Loving sexual minorities is the work and responsibility of the Church
and it's not enough for only pastors to be trained—we are all the Church
We must all take up this responsibility
and we can do it together as a people guided and empowered by the Holy Spirit

I hope that today can be one step in that work
that we all learn from each other
for many of you, today will create more questions than it will answer
and we won’t have time to answer all of those questions
encourage you to continue conversation with each other
and we will talk about other ways at the end to continue conversation




Let’s serve.
Learn how to better love sexual minorities

Commit in prayer to reaching this community

Accept the commission to serve



6

[Notes]
so today we’ll do three things




Share.
What have your experiences been?

Why did you come today? 



12

[Notes]
you’re going to be spending a lot of time talking with the people at your table today
a couple ground rules
be vulnerable: the more you are willing to share, you more you’ll get out of this
respect other: there will be people at your table that you disagree with, but we can all respect each other
be humble: approach everything in conversations with humility

to, after introducing yourself (if you already haven’t)
talk about what your experiences have been with sexual minorities
and share why you came to this event

2 other quick notes
space on handout to take notes
each time we have discussion, we’ll spend a minute reflect individually and then turn and talk to the group



How we use to do it.






Behave
Believe
Belong

[Notes]
for a long time, we were taught that to be a good Christian, you had to do three things in a certain order
first, we were told we had to behave
follow the rules
look like a good Christian
stop doing the bad things
then, once we looked on the outside like we were supposed to, we could start to believe
to believe in who Jesus was and what he did
go get to know our God through the Scriptures
and only then, after we looked like a Christian and we believed the right things, could we belong
were we told: you’re one of us
were we fully loved

the problem with this model is, it doesn’t work
I am sure you can each come up with a lot of reasons, but one good one is that this wasn’t the way Jesus did it



A better strategy.






Believe
Belong
Become

[Notes]
instead, the example we have in Scripture is Christ first inviting us to belong to the family
to be a part of
to find family
then, we are invited to discover and believe what is true
and finally, as we believe what is true, we are motivated from the inside out to become who Christ has called us to be

today, we’re going to learn how to love sexual minorities better through these lens
how can we come alongside sexual minorities in our lives as they belong, believe, and become



BELONG


[Notes]
first, before sexual minorities will believe or become who Christ has called them to be, we have to invite them to belong
to be a part of our churches and families and lives



Invite others to Belong.
Worship, pray, take communion
Share meals and life
Cry and celebrate
Seek Christ alongside each other




Belong
15

[Notes]
invite people to be a part of our church 
worship and pray and take communion next to us and with us 
share meals and life together 
seek Christ alongside each other in house church



Share.
Do sexual minorities feel like they belong?

If not, what prevents them from being able to belong?




Belong
21



Suggestions.




Belong
Create safe spaces to share

Show compassion and respect

Trust the Holy Spirit
25

[Notes]
how can we become a people where sexual minorities belong
create safe space to share
because there are people in your lives that experience same-sex attraction but you don’t know about because they aren’t yet sure if you’re safe
invite to share 
to share stories without ultimatums 
use sensitive language 
demonstrate compassion and respect 
recognize sins of the Church 
motivated by desire for the best things 
respect right to choose (you can’t control their choice anyway) 
trust holy spirit (patience) 
rarely are people argued into being a Christian or surrendering part of their life to Christ 
the Holy Spirit does that 
don’t try to do the Holy Spirit’s job, take responsibility for failure, take credit for success 
our part is to seek God shoulder to shoulder with others, encouraging them in their journey 
trust and be patient with the Holy Spirit to reveal what is true to sexual minorities
to challenge them to surrender on own time 
be ready for decades of loving 
goal is not success but faithfulness/obedience



Share.
How can you put these suggestions into action to better invite sexual minorities to belong?




Belong
31



A better strategy.





Believe
Belong

[Notes]
After people belong, once they get a taste of what is good and see glimpses of Christ in Christians,
they will start to explore and believe in who Christ was and what he did
in who our God is that created all things



BELIEVE


[Notes]
and we can come alongside sexual minorities in our lives as they begin to believe



Invite others to Believe.
What?

Why?

So What?




Believe

[Notes]
but before we can talk to anyone else about what they ought to believe and why, we have to examine what we each believe and why
we must first develop a strong foundation of our own understanding
I want to explore today the questions of
what should we believe?
why should we believe it?
and what difference does it make to sexual minorities?



What?



Experiencing same-sex attraction is not a sin.

Homosexual activity is a sin.

No promise of change in SSA.

We do not choose who we are attracted to but we choose how we respond.

Believe

[Notes]
I’ll start by sharing with you what I believe, and I want to do this for a couple of reasons
first, while I’m not a pastor at Ethos and I can’t speak for the body of Christians that makes up Ethos
these beliefs are shared by the pastors here at Ethos
and so I along with the pastors at Ethos, I encourage you to consider these beliefs
because we think they’re good ones
for those of you that believe similarly to me, these might put into words things you’ve been thinking
and for those of you who disagree, I encourage you to dialogue with the ideas and at least consider them



What?



Any sin can separate us from God, but Jesus offers salvation to all.

God promises transformation of the heart and provision of fullness to anyone who seeks Him faithfully.

Believe



What?



God calls the Church to love those who experience SSA regardless of what their journeys look like.

God loves LGBT+ people and He values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ.

Believe
35



Share.
Do you know what you believe?

Would you feel comfortable sharing with others?

Why or why not?




Believe
41



Why?



Preponderance of Biblical support

Same-sex sexual activity is sin

Marriage defined between man and women

Context of rape, incest, adultery, or sex outside of marriage

Written for a people in a time and place

Believe

[Notes]
Next I want to share with you why I believe what I believe
and again, the pastors here at Ethos come from a similar place
specifically on the question of whether homosexual activity is a sin

first, lets start with the bible



Why?



Created for perfect intimacy with God and the Body of Christ

Intimacy needs are good and normal

Neither sex nor marriage are promised or necessary to meet intimacy needs

Believe

[Notes]
but we can go deeper than just the handful of verses that talk about homosexuality
there are foundational truths about how God created us as relational beings that can help us answer this question
but you’ll quickly see that the reason we haven’t made arguments from these foundational truths is that few Christian really believe them and live them out

define intimacy needs
God creates Eve, Jesus when tempted and in garden, in Heaven
if we don’t meet in healthy ways or will meet in unhealthy ways

so for the sexual minority, yes, you were created for intimacy, but no one is promised or needs sex or marriage to meet their intimacy needs

even here we start to see some things that aren’t reflected in the Church
we don’t know how to meet needs outside of marriage or sex
and straight people don’t do this, so why should sexual minorities?




Why?



The Blessing of Singleness (really)

Every person is first called to singleness

Singleness and marriage are equal with different sets of advantages and challenges

Believe

[Notes]
benefits of singleness
and regardless of whether marriage later, all people should learn to do this well first

many people, gay and straight will be called to long-term singleness
but that’s not a curse
it’s a blessing equal to marriage

few churches teach these things
Church lift marriage on a pedestal and fail to provide support for single people to do singleness well



Why?



The Uniqueness of Christian Marriage

One man and one woman before God

Reflection of intimacy and complementarity in trinity

Centrality of child-rearing
Responsibility and commitment

Believe

[Notes]
many called out of singleness into marriage
vocation to raise children for kingdom

it’s not that we’re saying we don’t want gay people to be happy
its just that Christian marriage has been uniquely reserved for a specific purpose

instead what we often hear in the church is that every has a right to be married and the purpose of marriage is to make you happy



Why?



All are called to steward sexuality in inconvenient ways

All can meet their intimacy needs in singleness

Believe

[Notes]
why are these foundational beliefs important? how do they inform how we think about homosexual activity?
shows that all called to steward sexuality in inconvenient ways
All can meet their intimacy needs in singleness – or at least as much as anyone’s intimacy needs can be met in a broken world

the invitation to those who experience same-sex attraction is no less good and the challenges are no more great



Why?



Instead…

All are promised marriage 

We can’t meet our intimacy needs as single people 

Marriage is about being happy and we don’t need permission

Believe

[Notes]
the problem is that instead what we hear in churches is that

all promised marriage 
can’t meet our intimacy needs as single people 
marriage is about making self happy and can just take it if want it

so we shouldn’t be surprised that no one takes us seriously
that leaves us with a challenge as a church to foster a community where people can meet their intimacy needs as single people and teach accurately about marriage





So what?
People don’t care what we believe or why we believe it.

They care whether we are offering something better.




Believe
51

[Notes]
but even if we do that



Share.
Do you see and talk about marriage as the answer to loneliness?

Would single adults be able to meet their intimacy needs in meaningful friendship in your community?

Do you invite sinners of all kinds to share about their experience without shame or ultimatums?




Believe
57

[Notes]
do we offer something better?



So what?
Offer something better




Believe

[Notes]
if we really want to convince people—if we want them to believe and become—we have to offer something better—it’s on us



Be the Church.



Accurate theology about marriage

Nondiscriminatory application of Scripture

Shame-free church to talk about experience

Robust culture of singleness

Spiritual friendship to meet  intimacy needs

Believe

[Notes]
what could better look like
our challenge is to be a part of bringing this about



A better strategy.






Believe
Belong
Become

[Notes]
once they belong, they experience and see goodness, they want to believe 
and incrementally as they believe, Christ asks them to make him the Lord of that area of their life, surrendering to him those parts of their live and become who Christ made them to be
