Why churches struggle



Gay teens spend avg. of 5 yrs in the closet, w/out the love & wisdom of parents

Leading to loneliness, anxiety, shame, depression, sexual sin, addiction, abandoning God’s wisdom, suicide,            & loss of faith

[Notes]
Why are churches struggling to minister to gay people? How can Equip help?

Gay teens spend an average of five years in the closet making sense of their sexuality, often without the love and wisdom of parents—left alone with the lies of the Enemy and culture. This leads to loneliness, anxiety, shame, depression, sexual sin, addiction, abandoning God’s wisdom, suicide, and loss of faith. Gay teens are 5 times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers, and 54% of gay people have left the church. The wounds of the closet become the greatest barrier to gay Christians thriving according to a traditional sexual ethic, haunting them for a lifetime.



Why churches struggle



The Solution: ensure kids share as soon as they notice attractions by teaching kids before puberty

The Challenge: parents feel ill-equipped to lead convos and pastors feel ill-equipped to train parents

[Notes]
One of the best ways we can care for gay people in our churches is to make sure kids share with parents as soon as they notice same-sex attractions. In doing so, we can prevent these wounds from ever happening, leading to a lifetime of thriving according to God's teachings. But for kids to share early about their sexuality, parents need coaching and encouragement to teach about God's love and wisdom for gay people before their kids enter puberty.

Unfortunately most parents feel ill-equipped to start wound-preventing conversations. Why? Because pastors feel ill-equipped to train parents. Pastors know that parents are asking for help and that straight people are judging the goodness of God based on how churches care for gay people. Many leaders feel overwhelmed and alone—afraid to say or do the wrong thing but pressured from all sides to take action. Pastors have tried to speak carefully about LGBT+ topics according to a traditional sexual ethic, but they know that broaching the topic in a couple of sermons isn't enough. Leaders are already spread thin across many important priorities and need more expertise to confidently lead these conversations.

How Equip’s different



Gay Christians committed to God’s wisdom still struggle in most churches. Why?

Three key levers: protecting kids from the wounds of the closet, raising the bar for everyone’s sexual stewardship, and ensuring that vocational singles find lifelong lived-in family

[Notes]
Many churches strive to share about God’s love and wisdom for gay people in honest and empatheic ways. Many churches are preparing pastors and lay leaders to offer compassionate and theologically accurate one-on-one care to gay people. But gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic are still struggling in those churches. Why? Their churches are missing three key levers: preventing the wounds of the closet, raising the bar for everyone’s sexual stewardship, and ensuring that vocational singles find lifelong family, not loneliness.



Prevent closet wounds



We train parents (and/or equip pastors to train parents) to lead kids ages 2-12 in age-appropriate conversation about God’s wisdom for everyone’s sexual stewardship
including God’s love and wisdom for gay people
encourage kids to share with parents early)

[Notes]
The first way Equip is different is we can help you protect your kids from the wounds of the closet
I’ve already mentioned the on-average 5 year gap between when gay teens recognize their same-sex attractions and share with a parents, leading to painful wounds of the closet like anxiety, depression, suicide, and loss of faith.
As a therapist who has met with dozens of gay Christians in professional counseling, their wounds of the closet are the greatest barrier to thriving according to a traditional sexual ethic, haunting them for a lifetime.

And I’ve already mentioned that the solution is for parents to talk to their kids about God’s love and wisdom for gay people before puberty and invite their kids to share early if they notice same-sex attraction, so that kids share as soon as possible
That’s where Equip comes in
We train parents to lead kids ages 2-12 in age-appropriate conversation about God’s wisdom for everyone’s sexual stewardship, demonstrating safety and inviting children to share early about their sexuality.
Our industry-leading Parent Course is a 6-session, 12-hour intensive that deepens theological understanding, offers age-appropriate scripts for responding to kids’ questions over different age ranges, and offers scripts for leading proactive conversations with kids



Raise the bar for everyone’s stewardship



Deny the Enemy the powerful lie of the double standard (which also destructively enables straight Christians)

Casual romance, sex outside of marriage, pornography, discerning vocational singleness, openness to raising children, unbiblical divorce/remarriage

[Notes]
The second way Equip is different is we can help you raise the bar for sexual stewardship
Many churches lead straight Christians to assume that they will get married, teach that we need romantic companionship to be happy, and ignore the Bible’s teachings about vocational singleness and divorce. But then these same churches call gay Christians to a higher standard of sexual stewardship by teaching that gay Christians don’t need romance or sex and challenging them to consider vocational singleness. This inconsistent, hypocritical application of Scripture tempts sexual minorities to adopt a victim mentality and reject sexual morality standards because of the apparent double standard. Churches lose credibility to ask gay Christians to live according to biblical wisdom when they refuse to hold straight Christians accountable to that same wisdom.

Yet this inconsistent standard hurts straight Christians as well. Straight Christian marriages end in divorce at the same rate as non-Christian marriages, and unmarried straight Christians suffer from a lack of support in the church.

Instead, churches can invite everyone to steward their sexualities according to God’s good and weighty wisdom. This might include examining whether straight Christians are engaging in casual romance, having sex outside of marriage, making little or no progress on refraining from the use of pornography, failing to consider a call to vocational singleness, unthinkingly refusing an openness to raising children for the kingdom in marriage, or engaging in unbiblical divorce/remarriage. 



Helping vocational singleness find family



Teach about vocational singleness, celebrate commitments, hire as leaders, help all discern

Incubate intentional Christian communities where vocational singles (and marrieds) could find lifelong, lived-in family

[Notes]
The third way Equip is different is that we can help you foster family for vocational singles
Few churches are places where anyone can thrive in lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom, regardless of sexual orientation. Christian leaders don’t teach vocational singleness, teens don’t see vocational singleness modeled or celebrated, and vocational singles find themselves stuck in a revolving door of roommates or choose to live alone—starved of a consistent experience of family in the body of Christ.

Instead, our churches can teach what the Bible has to say about vocational singleness, guide teens and young adults to discern whether they are called to vocational singleness or Christian marriage, hire vocationally single leaders and pastors, and celebrate the callings of those called to vocational singleness. Moreover, churches can ensure that vocational singles enjoy lifelong, lived-in family in the body of Christ by helping vocational singles start intentional Christian communities by suggesting the idea, helping them cast vision for it, providing pastoral support while they explore the possibility, coaching them through the process, and even providing financial support in the early years.

Common Hurdles



Hesitate to clarify about God’s wisdom for gay people because don’t know how, doubt whether it’s fair/true/good
Know how to be caring/empathetic, but don’t know how to disciple to embrace and thrive according to God’s wisdom
Afraid to equip+encourage parents to lead convo due to fears it’s too early/confusing

[Notes]
fear of clarifying God's love and wisdom for gay people
don't know how to share with conviction, empathy, nuance, effectiveness
embarrassed of a traditional sexual ethic, doubts about whether it's really fair, true, good
Perhaps you think of gay people you know who tried to follow God’s wisdom but it turned out poorly
Or you’re worried about defending a traditional sexual ethic in front of more progressive friends
Or losing membership or donations

know how to be empathetic and caring toward LGBT+ people,
but don't know how to disciple them to embrace a trad sex ethic and thrive for a lifetime
You keep on seeing gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic abandoning God’s wisdom
And eventually abandoning the faith
And perhaps it feels futile

afraid to equip and encourage parents to have age-appropriate convos with their kids before puberty
Because parent are wary of sharing too early
And they’re afraid bring up the topic might confuse their kids into thinking they’re queer in some way



Common Hurdles



Afraid to lose membership/donations if hold straight people accountable to traditional sexual ethic, leading to double standard + victim mentality for gay people
Intimidated by work of fostering intentional Christian community + hesitate to invite straight people to consider vocational singleness

[Notes]
Hesitate to hold straight people accountable to a trad sex ethic
For fears of losing membership or donations
But that leads to a double standard, victim mentality among gay people, and easy way for gay people to dismiss teachings as homophobia

intimidated by work of fostering intentional Christian community
and hesitate to invite straight people to consider lifetime singleness
and dont know how to help them discern or thrive once committed

Vision + Strategy



Why are churches struggling to minister to gay people?
What does it look like to be a church where gay people are thriving?
What hurdles do churches commonly face?
What steps can churches take to minister effectively?



Effective Strategies



First steps often include internal clarity on theology and policies, planning for consistent accountability around sexual stewardship for all, and curating responses to FAQs

[Notes]
For most churches, we begin by leading the church through Equip’s Blueprint Process
That’s our signature strategic planning process for 8-10 leaders in a church
That helps a church cast a vision for effective ministry 5 years from now
And identifies a strategy for carefully realizing that vision over the next 5 years, customized for their church

After that, first steps often include the following:
- Exhaustive description of the church's theological convictions about sexual stewardship for all people and application to LGBT+ topics
- Detailing church policies related to sexual/gender identity terminology and eligibility for sacraments/service/membership/leadership
- More consistent accountability around romance/dating regardless of sexual orientation, discernment between vocational singleness and marriage regardless of sexual orientation, openness to the kingdom work of raising children in Christian marriage, and unbiblical divorce and remarriage
- Answering frequently asked questions to provide staff with carefully curated responses



Effective Strategies



The second phase often involves garnering buy-in from wider circle of staff/leadership, training a LGBT+ Care Team, exploring forming LGBT+ affinity spaces, and (lastly) building consensus with all lay leaders

[Notes]
The second phase of implementation often involves:
- gathering wider circles of staff and leadership, presenting the church’s Blueprint, and garnering buy-in
- assembling and training an LGBT+ Care Team of staff/lay leaders who have or will seek greater expertise to provide pastoral care to LGBTQ+ individuals
- exploring the formation of affinity spaces where LGBTQ+ Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic can gather with others of similar story and convictions for empathy and encouragement

Before public conversation (often during the second phase), staff will present the church’s Blueprint to lay leaders to continue building consensus.



Effective Strategies



The third phase often includes general education about God-honoring sexual stewardship for all people + God’s love & wisdom for gay people, equipping parents, teaching teens/kids, inviting young adults to discern, fostering intentional Christian community, and privately supporting MOMs

[Notes]
The third phase of implementation often includes the following public discipleship steps, in no particular order:
- General education for how the average Christian can love sexual minorities well, addressing common theological questions
- Teaching parents of young children how to lead kids ages 2-12 in age-appropriate conversation about sexual stewardship for all people before puberty, including God's love and wisdom for gay people, so that children will share earlier about same-sex attractions, avoid the wounds of the closet, and embrace God's wisdom
- Foster ongoing conversation with middle school and high school students about God's wisdom for everyone's sexual stewardship and God's particular wisdom for gay teens
- Programming for all ages about sexual stewardship for all people, including God’s intentions for everyone to enjoy human intimacy in the context of lifelong lived-in family, our default calling to temporary singleness and discernment, how and why every Christian young adult should open-handedly discern between vocational singleness and Christian marriage, and God's unique designs for vocational singleness and Christian marriage
- Exploration of how parents and leaders can better minister to LGB women according to a traditional sexual ethic
- Teaching about God's love and wisdom for individuals navigating gender identity questions
- Responding to the most convincing arguments for a progressive sexual ethic
- Preparing for Pride Month and National Coming Out Day by exploring how Christians can respond wisely and compassionately, including how to respond when someone comes out and why gay people are afraid to share their stories
- Practical guidance for young adults from church leaders in their discernment process followed by celebration/ceremony to mark their commitments to vocational singleness, if so called
- A process for cultivating/incubating intentional Christian community where kingdom singles can find family or knitting kingdom singles into unrelated nuclear families
- Honoring vocational singleness by hiring kingdom singles on staff, celebrating the kingdom work of vocational singles, and asking kingdom singles what they need and how they want to serve
- Offering support to mixed-orientation marriages and teaching accurately about the possibility of mixed-orientation marriages
