[Notes]
Hi, I’m Pieter Valk
I've studied at Vanderbilt University and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary
I got my Masters in Counseling at Lipscomb, and I worked in Lipscomb's Counseling Center for 3.5 years meeting with LGBT+ students making sense of faith and sexuality

I'm a Licensed Professional Counselor with a specialization in serving clients who are gay and Christian and seeking to steward their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic

I'm the Executive Director of EQUIP, a consulting ministry that helps churches become places where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic

A couple of clarifications from that mission statement: when I use the word "gay" in this conversation,
I don't mean to communicate anything about a person's theological convictions or sexual practices.
I use the word “gay” merely to describe people who experience same-sex attraction.

Also, when I say that I and the organization I lead are convinced of a traditional sexual ethic, I'm saying that we're convinced that God's best for Christians is
lifetime abstinent singleness to do kingdom work with undivided attention
OR lifetime marriage between one man and one women with an openness to raising children for the kingdom

Over the past 7 years EQUIP has trained 7500+ Christian leaders over 210 different trainings at 55 different churches, campus ministries, and Christian universities

In particular, EQUIP has worked with 10 different Christian universities and campus ministries
Most of that work has been with universities and campus ministries in Nashville
At one of those universities, I’ve led over 27 different events including trainings RAs,
training student life staff, training counseling center staff, training faculty,
teaching parents and ministers at a high school recruitment week,
starting and running a support group, training future youth pastors,
teaching 8 breakout chapels, and teaching 10 different academic class sessions

More recently, I’ve been contracted by the CCCU and secured $35k in grant funding
to develop a CCCU program to help institutions like Trevecca become places where all students consider God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship
and benefit from stewarding their sexualities according to that wisdom,
with the hope that students will embrace this wisdom for a lifetime.
The partnership program will pair CCCU institutions with experts in this topic and a robust and customizable vision and strategy.
And last but not least, I'm gay
and a Christian
and I believe that traditional sexual ethic is God's best for every Christian, including myself
I've committed to a lifetime of abstinent singleness and using my availability in singleness to serve God with undivided attention

my story

[Notes]
A little bit more about my story…
grew up in East Tennessee and went to church all of my life
when I realized I was gay in middle school, all I'd ever heard from Christians was that God hates gay people
so I kept my attractions a secret for years
But that secrecy was lonely

Spending all of those years trying to make sense of my sexuality alone was painful
I started to deal with deep shame because I thought it was my fault that I was gay and that God and my parents wouldn’t love me if I was gay
I slipped into some sinful habits to try to numb my shame and loneliness, and I started to develop symptoms of depression
I wish my parents or a youth pastor or a teacher or a school counselor would have spoken carefully about these topics and made it safe for me to share
So that I didn’t have to make sense of this alone
But no one did
So I tried to make myself straight
From age 15 to 25 I met with three therapists who promised to increase my heterosexuality,
attended multiple psychotherapeutic ex-gay retreats,
interned with a pray-the-gay-away ministry for 9 months,
and prayed nightly for God to make me straight.
but my same-sex attractions never changed
AND I continued to be convinced of a traditional sexual ethic


Same-sex attraction is a result of the Fall, a brokenness
Experiencing attraction is not a sin
Neither born gay nor choose to be gay
Orientation change efforts are destructively ineffective
Same-sex romantic and sexual activity are sins
God’s best is vocational singleness or Christian marriage

[Notes]
to be clear: I believe that experiencing same-sex attraction—me finding other guys physically attractive and desiring romantic relationships with them, being gay—is a result of the Fall.
When Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, their sin led to a domino effect of brokenness.
The introduction of sin bent all of the ways God had perfectly designed and ordered this world.
To the extent that this world around us, the people around us, and even ourselves are not how God first intended us. 
All of us, regardless of sexual orientation, are corrupted at a genetic level, developed imperfectly in our mother’s womb, and were born into a broken world that wounded us long before we ever gained the capacity to sin
So I don’t think that when God first imagined me and projected me being born into a perfect world, that God planned for me to experience same-sex attraction
But because I was born into a broken world, one of the ways I was affected by that brokenness is that I gained these attractions
But I want to be clear that being gay, experiencing same-sex attraction, is not a sin.
It is a brokenness, a temptation to sin, but God doesn’t hold my attractions against me.
God does not send people to hell merely because boys are attracted to boys or girls are attracted to girls.
I do not believe people choose who they are attracted to; choose to be gay or straight.
The consensus of scientists is that people develop their sexual attractions through a mix of nature and nurture,
but people do not choose who they are attracted to.

And there’s no formula for changing a person’s attractions:
no proven combination of prayer or counseling or weekend retreats to change someone’s sexual orientation. Certainly God has the power to do whatever he wants,
but scientific studies show that 96% of people who seek sexual orientation change efforts experience no change in their sexual orientation,
but sexual orientation changes efforts have been shown to cause a 92% increase in the risk of suicidality
Yet even if I don’t choose who I am attracted to, I do choose how I respond to those temptations
As the majority of Christians over the past 2,000 years and the majority of global Christians today understand the Bible, God calls all Christians to steward their sexualities according a traditional sexual ethic
There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses in Scripture
Same-sex sexual and romantic activity are sins in any context

Now, some are convinced of these teachings by the clobber passages, the 6 or so passages in Scripture that some claim speak directly about same-sex sexual activity
Personally, I don’t think those passages are necessary to know God’s wisdom for gay people
I’m convinced of a traditional sexual ethic by the whole of Scripture, by how God’s word consistently lifts up lifetime abstinent singleness to do kingdom work with undivided attention and opposite-sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the kingdom as God’s best for His people
Now, that may seem wildly unfair to me and other gay people.
Why would God allow something to develop in a broken way but choose not to heal it?
Well, there's a lot of people dealing with physical brokenness that isn't their fault and couldn't have reasonably been prevented who pray for God's healing but God doesn’t heal them.
So they have to faithfully walk forward with that brokenness, sometimes painfully managing that for a lifetime.
I guess I/m not alone/unique in that way.

Sexual Stewardship
on Christian Campuses

[Notes]
Okay, so now that you know more about my story and what I believe
I want to cast a vision for how Trevecca could become a place where all students consider God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship and benefit from stewarding their sexualities according to that wisdom, with the hope that students will embrace this wisdom for a lifetime
And then I want to offer some effective strategies, practical steps for realizing that vision at Trevecca





Many universities avoid and delay
Without a robust vision, tangible proof of good fruit, and relationships with stakeholders many Christian universities respond to crisis by…
Scrambling to defend a traditional sexual ethic but failing, leading to institutional decline
Repeated compromise, leading to a sliding abandonment of a traditional sexual ethic

[Notes]
In contrast, Many Christian universities offer vague and cursory policy statements about sexual stewardship and intentionally minimize campus conversation, hoping to avoid cultural conflict over gender and sexuality
Take small measures in response to crises
And hope that the university will quickly return to the status quo of silence and comfort

In reality, one of two things happens when universities are reluctant to cast a bold, beautiful vision and fail to take the steps necessary to secure that vision

When universities haven’t done the work
They’re either taken off guard by crises, try to scramble to mount a sturdy defense of a traditional sexual ethic, and crumble
because they haven’t done the longterm work to cast a vision, build relationships, and demonstrate good fruit
Or they make small compromise after small compromise with different elements of their community,
and over decades, the university slides and abandons a traditional sexual ethic



A vision for a faithful Trevecca
 All students are invited to think deeply about their sexual stewardship and honor institutional policies 
LGBT+ students committed to a traditional sexual ethic feel safe to connect with resources early, find belonging, and thrive in and beyond college 
LGBT+ students convinced of a progressive sexual ethic will be invited to consider the wisdom of a traditional sexual ethic while still finding belonging, respect, and dignity

[Notes]
I want to cast a vision for something very different
To be clear, there are some LGBT+ students at Trevecca who believe God makes people gay and that God blesses gay marriages.
Those students are made in the image of God, and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect

And, I want to particularly invite you to think of a different kind of student when considering how Trevecca can serve gay students
because most of the clients I served in a Christian college counseling center didn't show up to college waving rainbow flags and fighting for LGBT+ equality
most of the clients I served came to the university already aware of their same-sex attractions, afraid that people would find out about their sexuality, and hoping to follow a traditional sexual ethic

when they got to Christian college, the loudest voices were either seemingly homophobic or committed to a progressive sexual ethic
they watched as these loudest voices clashed on campus, and nowhere felt safe for these scared gay freshmen to share their story and seek support to follow God's wisdom
so they tried to do it alone, but stewarding one's sexuality alone is painful
it often leads to loneliness, anxiety, shame, depression, sexual sin, addiction, and even suicidality and loss of faith
by the time they met with me in counseling, they were barely hanging on and usually we couldn't undo the damage done by them having make sense of this alone
when you think of how Trevecca could serve gay students, I want you to think of this student
a scared freshman who hoped Trevecca would be a place where he could find support to steward his sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic
but didn't
and eventually either abandoned a traditional sexual ethic or lost his faith altogether
but what if Trevecca offered something different?
What if from the moment a potential student researches Trevecca to the moment an LGBT+ student graduates, Trevecca made both its theological convictions and compassion for gay students clear?
What if Trevecca developed a robust set of resources for LGBT+ students, particularly for those committed to a traditional sexual ethic, and shared with freshmen students about those resources early, demonstrating safety and inviting them to connect?
What if Trevecca continued to provide those gay students committed to a traditional sexual ethic both public and private support throughout their 4 years at Trevecca so that they held onto their faith, held onto a traditional sexual ethic, and actually thrived according to God’s wisdom?
And what if Trevecca made crystal clear before students ever step on campus what limits and accountability there will be for students who don’t steward their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic, treating LGBT+ students with a progressive sexual ethic with respect and dignity
the key here is that resources to support gay students to follow a traditional sexual ethic need to be robustly offered and students need to be encouraged to share
Plus, these aren’t just my observations or hunches.
Mark Yarhouse out of Wheaton College has done the gold-standard research when it comes to Christian universities and sexual minorities.
His research has found that deeper faith among sexual minority students at Christian colleges and universities leads to better academic performance,
reduced psychological distress,
greater belief in a traditional biblical sexual ethic,
and more faithful sexual stewardship.

His research has found that disclosure is a key lever for students to find support from peers and access campus resources.
He reports that most sexual minority students are not demanding their campuses abandon a traditional biblical sexual ethic,
but instead are asking for clarity about policies, private small group support spaces, larger all-student educational programs, and additional training for campus faculty and staff.

In short, the research shows that clarity about theology and policies plus connecting students with supportive and biblically aligned resources leads to better academic performance, reduced psychological distress, greater belief in a traditional biblical sexual ethic, and more faithful sexual stewardship.
now some of you may fear that encouraging these gay students to share their story so they can connect with resources is counterproductive to them following God's wisdom
I’ll recognize that it is true that gay students hiding in the closet may delay publicly adopting a progressive sexual ethic
But unintentionally forcing students to process without the wisdom/care of Trevecca faculty/staff greatly increases their chances of eventually embracing false teaching or abandoning faith altogether
If our hope is that LGBT+ students would embrace God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship and learn to flourish according to His teachings for a lifetime,
the best strategy is to encourage students to share early and connect with robust resources that support a traditional sexual ethic

How?



Practical Steps: Before Trevecca
University has clarified theological perspective for faculty and staff, cast winsome vision, and detailed careful strategy
University has earned the support of alumni, donors, staff, faculty, current students, LGBT+ students, and relevant off-campus groups
University has gathered a team of those who minister to LGBT+ students + trained this team to provide effective pastoral care to LGBT+ students


[Notes]
I want to break down practical steps into three stages for the hypothetical student:
Before Trevecca
Freshman Year
Year Two and Beyond

First, before a Trevecca student moves onto campus, four things have happened:

University leaders have clearly described their theological perspective for campus faculty and staff,
cast a winsome vision for becoming a university where all students thrive according to God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship, and detailed a careful strategy for realizing this bold vision
including how policies impact employment, approval of student organizations, and romance and dating involving students

University leaders have sought out Board members, alumni, and other influencial members of the wider community who might be skeptical of the project to privately build consensus
University leaders have invested the time and energy to gain the support of community stakeholders for this vision and strategy, including alumni, donors, staff, faculty, current students, LGBT+ students, and relevant off-campus groups.

The university has gathered a team of those who minister to LGBT+ students, including
mental health counselors,
RAs, 
campus pastors,
student health workers,
student conduct administrators,
Coaches,
Freshman Year Experience faculty and upperclassmen,
Local college pastors,
and professors. In addition, the university has trained this team to provide effective pastoral care to LGBT+ students, within the bounds of their specific professions, including a guide for pastoral responses to common questions and circumstances.


Practical Steps: Before Trevecca
University communicates clearly to prospective students and parents about the teaching and support for God-honoring sexual stewardship offered
Prevents claims of being misled and clarifies boundaries for all students


[Notes]
Before students step foot on campus, the university communicates clearly to prospective students and parents about the teachings and support for God-honoring sexual stewardship offered,
preventing experiences where students feel misled about the university’s beliefs and practices and providing clarity about the boundaries for students in light of these policies


Then the next stage of practical steps takes place during a student’s first year


Practical Steps: Freshman Year
University has highlighted God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship and invited LGBT+ students to connect trained staff to find support and community during student orientation and Freshman Year Experiences
LGBT+ students have heard the stories of past and present students who have benefitted from safe spaces where they could integrate their faith and sexuality


[Notes]
During student orientation and in Freshman Year Experiences, the university has highlighted God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship
and invited LGBT+ students to connect with trained staff to find support and community.
LGBT+ students have heard the stories of past and present students who have benefitted from safe spaces where they could integrate their faith and sexuality.
Straight students have seen compassionate and charitable conversation about sexuality modeled.


And finally, during a student’s second year and beyond, we want to take the following practical steps:






Practical Steps: Year Two + Beyond
LGBT+ students find support from campus pastors, coaches, student chaplains, mental health counselors, and professors
University has engaged in ongoing community conversation, exploring God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship for all, and its applications to sexual and gender minorities with nuance and depth.
Required section during NT or Christian Theology class, Chapel, RA events, campus-wide seminars, etc.


[Notes]
Across an LGBT+ student’s college experience, LGBT+ students find support from campus pastors, coaches, student chaplains, mental health counselors, local campus pastors, and professors

The university has engaged in ongoing community conversation,
exploring God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship for all, and its applications to sexual and gender minorities with nuance and depth.
Community conversation may include a required section in freshman theology class focusing on God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship, all-student and breakout chapels on the topic, smaller events on residence halls, and campus-wide seminars open to the public


Practical Steps: Year Two + Beyond
LGBT+ students offered fellowship spaces where they can safely enjoy community, whether they prefer fellowship with those of similar or more diverse theological perspectives
LGBT+ and straight Christian students steward their sexualities in God-honoring ways + straight Christian students go on to love and support their LGBT+ siblings according to a traditional sexual ethic


[Notes]
In addition to private, confidential support from appropriate university staff, LGBT+ students are offered spaces where they can comfortably enjoy Christian fellowship. LGBT+ students who prefer to fellowship only with those who share a traditional biblical sexual ethic,
LGBT+ students who prefer to fellowship only with those who share a progressive sexual ethic, and
LGBT+ students who prefer fellowship spaces where both perspectives are prominent
have all found spaces carefully guided by university leadership.
These might be led by campus pastors, sponsored and/or led by trusted faculty, or hosted by a local church near campus

And finally, after students graduate, if we’ve taken all of these practical steps, we hope the last step is celebrating with God the good fruit of our faithfulness:
While not all students will graduate having joined the family who call themselves Christians and committed themselves to God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship,
the university hopes that straight Christian students will accept a lifetime call to steward their own sexualities in God-honoring ways, even when countercultural.

The university hopes straight Christian students have learned how to think in theologically accurate and compassionate ways about LGBT+ topics,
leading to greater love and support of their LGBT+ siblings.

Plus, the university hopes that LGBT+ Christian students will embrace a lifetime call to God-honoring sexual stewardship and continuing thriving according to God’s wisdom long after college.


A vision for a faithful Trevecca
Lean into discomfort to accomplish a robust vision

Center the conversation on God-honoring sexual stewardship that brings the most goodness to each of our lives

Commit yourselves to the practical steps necessary to realize that vision, even when risky


[Notes]
Wheaton college, Gordon college, and Calvin university have taken some similar steps
But I can’t say that any of them have committed themselves to a vision this bold

But if you’re interested in leading students and other Christian universities with a robust vision for Trevecca, now is the time
Many wait until a crisis to address these topics publicly
To have this conversation as a community
But what if instead, you pre-emptively started doing the big work?
And prevented the bad fruit of scrambling in response to a crisis!

And I’d suggest for you to focus, first and foremost on discipleship
of course a big part of external communication must be about recognizing sexual and gender minorities as people on the margins, particularly in conservative Christian spaces
And welcoming the diversity they contribute to this community

And at the same time, the focus should be discipleship
Universities like Wheaton and Gordon are succeeding where others have failed because with compassion and nuance, they’ve centered the conversation on God’s call for His people to faithfully steward their sexualities in ways that honor God and bring the most goodness to each of our lives

What does that mean for your vision and action to focus on discipleship?
It means cast a bold vision for a Trevecca where all students consider God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship and benefit from stewarding their sexualities according to that wisdom, with the hope that students will embrace this wisdom for a lifetime
You set that as the goal
You commit yourselves to the practical steps necessary to realize that vision
Even when they’re risky, because half-measures have proven to be ineffective
And the testimony of this institution depends on it




assemble and train LGBTQ+ student care team
