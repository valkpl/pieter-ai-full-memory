INTIMACY & FAMILY


[Notes]
Today we’re going to start with the foundation
How has God created each of us for intimacy in the context of family, regardless of sexual orientation?

Why start here?
Usually people start by focusing the conversation on

When we attempt to talk to teens about sex, dating, intimacy, and family, we typically focus on urging them to refrain from sexual activity. 
But by focusing only on dating, sex, and marriage when we try to communicate a biblical sexual ethic to our kids, we admit that the best things in life are sex and marriage. To those who will never marry or have sex (for whatever reason), we mislead them into believing that their calling is lesser. And to those who will marry, and have sex, we set false expectations that marriage and sex will end loneliness and fulfill them completely. Plus, a focus on dating, marriage, and sex communicates to gay teens that if they obey God’s teachings, they are likely to miss out on the best things that God has to offer. 

When we focus only on sex and marriage, the Church suffers, too: very few people submit to the calling of singleness in order to serve God with undivided attention, more Christians fall into pornography usage (somewhere around 10% of Christian women and 64% of Christian men view pornography at least monthly https://www.provenmen.org/pornography-survey-statistics-2014/), divorce rates soar when the fulfillment we were promised doesn’t come (among those who attend church regularly, about 38% have been divorced https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/factchecker-divorce-rate-among-christians/#_ftn1), and 54% of gay people who grow up in the Church end up leaving the faith (Us versus Us by Andrew Marin). We must offer something better.

We need to zoom out to include more of the possibilities God has for us and frame the conversation around the right questions: How has God created all of us for intimacy with God and other humans? What are the best ways for every person to enjoy human intimacy in the context of family? How are all of us called to submit to God our capacities for romance and sex? How can all of us enjoy deep relationship in committed community, regardless of whether we’re called to committed singleness or Christian marriage? To answer those questions, to figure out what we’re made for, maybe we should start by looking at our Creator. At God.





Intimacy & Family



God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.

God is a being who enjoys intimacy in the context of family, and He created us in His image for those same things.

[Notes]
God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.

How do we know that? Because God is a being who enjoys intimacy in the context of family, and He created us in His image for those same things.
 
God put Himself in families. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit make up a family called the Trinity. And the Trinity created this world, made man, gave us choice, and sent His son to live a perfect life and die on the cross for our sins so that we could be a part of His family. The Bible goes even further to establish that God is in family and He invites us into that family by calling us, the group of people who follow Jesus, Christ’s bride and calling Jesus our groom. We’re being married into the family of God.  

(SKIP) In John 3:29, John the Baptist meets Jesus for the first time and describes himself as a guest at a wedding where Jesus is the groom and the people of God are his bride. In Ephesians 5 Paul uses an analogy of a husband and wife to teach Christ-followers to submit to God and to celebrate that we are Christ’s bride. Finally, in Revelation 19:6-9, the Apostle John describes a wedding feast at the end of time when Christ returns triumphantly to celebrate being united with his bride, the Church—that’s us!



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)

[Notes]
But God isn’t just a being in a family. The love enjoyed in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church is a particular kind of love. Historically, Christians have characterized that love in six ways: God’s love is complementary, intimate, procreative, faithful, sacrificial, and hospitable:

First, God’s love is complementary or diverse. There is a different-ness between the persons of the Trinity—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. And there is complementarity between Christ and his bride, the Church.






Intimacy & Family



“After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne…” (Revelations 7:9)

[Notes]
(SKIP) In Revelations 7:9, the Apostle John describes a celebration of the diversity of God’s people: “After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne…”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)

[Notes]
Second, God’s love is intimate. The persons of the Trinity know each other perfectly and are fully known by each other.




Intimacy & Family



“‘My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they...be one as we are one—I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.’” (John 17:20)

[Notes]
(SKIP) In John 17:20, Jesus speaks longingly about the Trinity when praying for his disciples: “‘My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they...be one as we are one—I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.’
 




Intimacy & Family



“...At that moment heaven was opened, and [Jesus] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’” (Matthew 3:16-17)

[Notes]
God the Father reciprocates this affection. Just after Jesus is baptized, the following happens in Matthew 3:16-17” “...At that moment heaven was opened, and [Jesus] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’”



Intimacy & Family



“Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. We love because he first loved us.” (1 John 4: 7, 8, and 19)

[Notes]
Plus, Christ intimately knows and loves His people and wants them to seek out relationship with Him.

(SKIP)  1 John 4: 7, 8, and 19 say, “Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. We love because he first loved us.” We can only love because God Himself is love, made us to be creatures who love, and loved us first.




Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)

[Notes]
Third, God’s love is procreative or life-giving. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit made the world, filled it with animals, and made us humans, together. The Trinity gave us life. And then God became man and Jesus lived and died for us so that we could have life.

In John 10:10 Jesus says, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” Without Jesus we are dead people walking. We have sinned against God, and we do not deserve to join Him in heaven. But Jesus paid the price for our sins so that we could have eternal life.
 
Fourth, the love of God is faithful or permanent. There is a perfect and permanent faithfulness in the Trinity and from Christ to His people. No matter what we do, God will never abandon us or withhold his love.




Intimacy & Family



“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is [God’s] faithfulness.” (Lamentations 3:22-23)

[Notes]
(SKIP) Lamentations 3:22-23 says it this way: “The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is [God’s] faithfulness.”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)

[Notes]
Fifth, the love of God is sacrificial. As we’ve already mentioned, Jesus offered himself up as a perfect sacrifice so that all of God’s children could return to Him. 




Intimacy & Family



“You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly... But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:6 and 8)

[Notes]
(SKIP) Paul describes Christ’s sacrifice in this way in Romans 5:6 and 8: “You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly... But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)
Hospitable (Luke 14, Leviticus 19)

[Notes]
And finally, the love of God is hospitable. Ultimately, the work of creating this world and humans to fill it was an invitation into God’s family. And then God extended His arms of invitation again by dying on the cross so we could be reunited with Him.



Intimacy & Family



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

[Notes]
Okay, but what does the fact that God is in family and enjoy love in that family characterized by those 6 things have to do with us, humans?

Well, because we are created in God’s image, we are made for that kind of love with God and each other
We were made for image-bearing intimacy.





Intimacy & Family



“‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.” (Genesis 1:26-27)

[Notes]
“‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.”
That’s what God said in Genesis 1:26-27 when He created the first humans. We are made in His image. We are imitations, designed to be like God. That’s a big deal, and there’s so much we can learn from that. If we were designed to imitate God, then the nature of God can teach us about ourselves. If we’re unsure what we were made for—what we need—one way to figure that out is by looking at what God values, how He relates to the people around Him. So if God enjoys intimacy in the context of family, maybe we are made for those same things, because we are made in His image.





Intimacy & Family



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

Sexuality – our need for relationship, to know and be known, to give and receive that kind of love

[Notes]
So God enjoys love characterized by diversity, intimacy, giving life, faithfulness, sacrifice, and hospitality.
And we’re made in his image for that same kind of love
So we’re all made for human intimacy complementary, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment, sacrifice, and hospitality

our sexuality is our need for those things
our need to be in relationship
to know and be known
to give and receive love
and because we are mind, body, and spirit, we need connection on cognitive, physical, and spiritual levels





Intimacy & Family



We are all created for intimacy in the context of family.

[Notes]
But God didn’t just enjoy intimacy
He enjoyed it in the context of family
And we’re made in His image for that too
We were made for image-bearing family.

we are all created to enjoy this within the context of family. But when I say family, I don’t just mean married people and kids. In Matthew 12:46-50, Jesus subverts our understanding of family, rejecting familial ties based solely on biology and instead establishing that Christian family is bound by the blood of Christ:




Intimacy & Family



“While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, ‘Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.’ But to the one who had told him this, Jesus replied, ‘Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?’ And pointing to his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’” (Matthew 12:46-50)

[Notes]
“While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, ‘Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.’ But to the one who had told him this, Jesus replied, ‘Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?’ And pointing to his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’”
Jesus defines Christian family as a small community of Christians who live life together and embody the gospel for each other. 



Intimacy & Family



We are all created for intimacy in the context of family.

Family – a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other

[Notes]
From the beginning, families made up of God’s children were intended to imitate the love within the Trinity and between God and His people: to bear the image of that love. The love found in families was intended to be intimate, faithful, sacrificial, diverse, live-giving, and hospitable, embodying God’s love in beautiful ways.

How might these six characteristics impact we find intimacy in the context of family?

How might this broader definition of family as “a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other” challenge the idolatry of romance in your church?

Intimacy & Family



We don’t need romance, sex, or marriage, and that is good news.

We have emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy needs.


[Notes]
Some caveats or limitations about this intimacy in the context of family:

We don’t need romance, sex, or marriage, and that is good news.
We don’t actually need romance or marriage or sex to meet our needs for intimacy. The Bible never promises marriage or sex to people who follow God, and nowhere does God say we need marriage or sex to be whole, happy people. Yes, we have physical and emotional needs. And yes, romance and sex are one way we can fill those, but not the only ways. Let me explain.

One way to think about our needs for connection is to imagine a set of buckets that need to be filled with water. Each of the buckets represent a kind of intimacy we need. God made us mind, body, and spirit, so we need connection on an emotional level, intellectual level, physical level, and spiritual level.



Intimacy & Family





[Notes]
When I say emotional intimacy, I mean having conversations that help you connect with gladness or fear or anger or sadness inside of you, and where you notice some of those same things in others. When I say spiritual intimacy, I mean connecting in a way that makes you feel more connected to God, by talking about spiritual things, reading Scripture together, or worshipping together. When I say physical intimacy, I mean a hug, holding hands, sitting next to each other on the couch, putting your arm around someone’s shoulder, and yes, kissing and cuddling and sex. When I say intellectual intimacy, I mean exchanging and exploring ideas with another person.
Imagine four buckets, one labeled “emotional,” the second labeled “spiritual,” the third labeled “physical,” and the fourth labeled “intellectual.” Now some would argue that there is a fifth bucket labeled “sexual.” That we all need sexual intimacy to be whole, and if we don’t get it, we will feel empty.
But I know plenty of people who have never had sex and who are full adults. They share with me that they have vibrant social lives, rich intimacy, and a satisfying experience of community. That’s been true in my own life. The healthy emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy I have experienced in friendships has been much more satisfying than the broken physical intimacy I have experienced in the past.

Plus, the Bible doesn’t teach that we need sex or marriage to be whole people. Quite the opposite. Jesus didn’t have sex. Paul was committed to celibacy. Many of the mothers and fathers of the Church have been celibate. And Jesus says that in Heaven, there won’t be any more marriage or sex.



Intimacy & Family



“At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” (Matthew 22:30)

[Notes]
In Matthew 22:30, He says this: “At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” It doesn’t make too much sense that our Savior was celibate or that we will all be celibate in heaven if marriage and sex are necessary to be fully human.
Instead, there are four intimacy buckets. Emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual. God provides a good chunk of our spiritual intimacy. Those who are married will partially fill each of those buckets with the intimacy from their marriage. But, even if you’re married, God and your spouse alone won’t fill your intimacy needs buckets. You will still need emotional intimacy, intellectual intimacy, physical intimacy, and spiritual intimacy from friendship.



Intimacy & Family





[Notes]
And that’s good news!
That’s good news for single people. If either a call from God or circumstances lead you to a life without romance, marriage, or sex, you can still fill your buckets. You can still meet your emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy needs in healthy ways through friendship.
That’s good news for married people. Trying to squeeze all of your intimacy needs out of God and your spouse is a good recipe for divorce. But since you don’t need romance or sex to fill any of your intimacy need buckets, you can meet the rest of your intimacy needs through intimate friendship.



Share



Why do some believe we NEED romance, sex, or marriage?

How might seeing our intimacy needs as buckets to be filled with intimacy with God, friends, and (for some) a spouse change the way we respond to our longings?

Intimacy & Family



None of us will meet our intimacy needs fully and finally in this lifetime.

If we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, the broken parts of our soul and mind tend to reach out for destructive and unsatisfying shortcuts.


[Notes]
None of us will meet our intimacy needs fully and finally in this lifetime. Isaiah 59:2 says that our sins, our imperfection, our unwise choices have separated us from God and each other. Because this world is broken and we are broken, we can only ever connect with God and each other imperfectly. There’s this distance because of brokenness that we can never cross. Some amount of loneliness is a part of life. It is unavoidable.
 
So should we just give up and stop trying to connect in healthy ways? No! For starters, even if we can’t meet all of our needs fully and finally, we can still get a lot of what we need. We can still enjoy rich, satisfying intimacy with God and other people in this life. And second, if we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, the broken parts of our soul and mind tend to reach out for destructive and unsatisfying shortcuts.

Have you noticed that? When you ignore your need for community and connection and try to go at it alone, you end up making unwise decisions later. Lust, objectification, masturbation, pornography, dating apps, meaningless hookups, and adultery all become more difficult to resist. If we try to meet our intimacy needs in those broken ways, we won’t fill our buckets. We just kick them over, and it makes a mess. Instead, we need to actively work to meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways. We need to be intentional about seeking out intimate friendship with others and proactively meet our needs.




Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)
Hospitable (Luke 14, Leviticus 19)

[Notes]
So God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.
And the love we enjoy in that family should point us back to the love in God’s family, should serve as an image of God’s love, should embody the gospel by being complementary, intimate, procreative, faithful, sacrificial, and hospitable

So what does that look like practically?
And how do we do that well?
That’s what we’re going to spend the next 3 weeks on

In short, God has given us two specific ways to do that, he has designed two vocations for stewarding our sexualities in ways that honor Him and point us back to Him: vocational singleness and Christian marriage
Both of these vocations embody those 6 characteristics of the love in God’s family
Both vocations are calls to intimacy in the context of human family



Intimacy & Family



Christian vocation - a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children

[Notes]
Why do I say vocation? Well, A Christian vocation is generally a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision. 

Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children

The practice of vocational singleness and Christian marriage in our churches should be so beautiful that those who do not yet know Jesus want to draw close to them and get to know the Source of that love
When non-believers step into the homes of Christian marriages or vocational singles living together as a family, the love found there should help people believe that God loves them
And they should experience God’s love through those families

That’s why it’s so important for our churches to be places where people are thriving in Christian marriage and vocational singleness—because the gospel depends on it
And that’s why we have to teach accurately about these



Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of temporary singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to a vocation of Christian marriage
Others called to a vocation of singleness for the kingdom

[Notes]
So, how does a Christian know which of these vocations they are called to?
What’s God’s design for each of these vocations?
How do we do them well?

Here’s a summary of how Christians have historically understood the Bible to teach about sexual stewardship
This is the big picture for what it looks like to faithfully, in God-honoring ways, steward our sexualities



Sexual Stewardship




[Notes]
Here’s a representation of those same idea in a diagram
As we will tease out more later, vocational singleness is distinct from temporary singleness
It is best for everyone to settle down into marriage or vocational singleness, instead of languishing in temporary singleness
Marriage and vocational singleness are equally good callings, but marriage will be more common
There is no default path, one’s calling should be an open-handed question for every Christian

Remember, I’ll tease out all of these claims in the slides to come

SEXUAL
STEWARDSHIP

FOR ALL




[Notes]
How has God invited all Christians to steward their sexuality?



INTIMACY & FAMILY


[Notes]
Last week we started by talking about intimacy and famly
We asked: How has God created each of us for intimacy in the context of family, regardless of sexual orientation?

I got a couple of questions asking why we started here?
Well, usually people start conversation like this by focusing on sex and marriage

But by focusing only on dating, sex, and marriage when we try to communicate a biblical sexual ethic to people, we admit that the best things in life are sex and marriage. To those who will never marry or have sex (for whatever reason), we mislead them into believing that their calling is lesser. And to those who will marry, and have sex, we set false expectations that marriage and sex will end loneliness and fulfill them completely. Plus, a focus on dating, marriage, and sex communicates to gay people that if they obey God’s teachings, they are likely to miss out on the best things that God has to offer. 

When we focus only on sex and marriage, the Church suffers, too:
very few people submit to the calling of singleness in order to serve God with undivided attention,
more Christians fall into pornography usage (somewhere around 10% of Christian women and 64% of Christian men view pornography at least monthly https://www.provenmen.org/pornography-survey-statistics-2014/),
divorce rates soar when the fulfillment we were promised doesn’t come (among those who attend church regularly, about 38% have been divorced https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/factchecker-divorce-rate-among-christians/#_ftn1), 
and 54% of gay people who grow up in the Church end up leaving the faith (Us versus Us by Andrew Marin). We must offer something better.

We need to zoom out to include more of the possibilities God has for us and frame the conversation around the right questions: How has God created all of us for intimacy with God and other humans? What are the best ways for every person to enjoy human intimacy in the context of family? How are all of us called to submit to God our capacities for romance and sex? How can all of us enjoy deep relationship in committed community, regardless of whether we’re called to committed singleness or Christian marriage? To answer those questions, to figure out what we’re made for, maybe we should start by looking at our Creator. At God.

So that’s why we started where we did





Stewardship for All



How has God created us for intimacy in the context of family?
What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?
What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?
What is Christian marriage, and why does God’s wisdom matter?

[Notes]
Now, we’ve got that solid foundation that God has created us in His image to enjoy intimacy in the context of family
We’ve defined intimacy and family broadly
And we’ve teased that there are two best ways for Christian to walk out their sexuality: lifetime abstinent singleness for the sake of the kingdom or opposite-sex Christian marriage for the sake of raising children
But what do we do in the meantime? How do we know whether we are called to vocational singleness or Christian marriage?

That’s what we’re going to talk about today

What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?



Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of temporary singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to a vocation of Christian marriage
Others called to a vocation of singleness for the kingdom

[Notes]
Here’s a snapshot again of how Christians have historically understood the Bible to teach about sexual stewardship
This is the big picture for what it looks like to faithfully, in God-honoring ways, steward our sexualities



Sexual Stewardship




[Notes]
Here’s the same ideas but in diagram form

What both of these representations point out is that we start in temporary singleness



TEMPORARY SINGLENESS


[Notes]
So what is temporary singleness and how do we do it well?



Temporary Singleness



A period of temporary singleness
Enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ
Called to neither lifelong vocational singleness nor marriage
Submit our sexuality to God, study the Scriptures, discern with God and others

[Notes]
What are we first called to?

We are all first called to a temporary period of abstinent singleness in which we enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ in non-sexual, non-romantic companionship.
We should all learn to do this well
This is a calling to neither vocational singleness nor marriage—defining our default calling in the negative is not sufficient but it is informative—we are not yet called to vocational singleness or to marriage. 
We should not assume that we are called to marriage just because we have sexual desires, want to be a parent, or find abstinent singleness to be too challenging. 
We should all submit our sexuality to God, study what the Scriptures have to say about sexual stewardship, and discern with God and spiritual mentors in our lives whether we are called to vocational singleness or marriage.

As I mentioned earlier, the Church has consistently taught that it is NOT God’s intention for Christians to continue in temporary for a lifetime
For the vast majority, it is better to settle down into vocational singleness or marriage
But there are always exceptions to the rule
There will be people whom God calls to leave open the possibility of vocational singleness or marriage in there 30s, 40s, 50s, or perhaps even their entire life
Our churches need to honor and support all those who are faithfully following God’s call







Temporary Singleness
Temporary vs. Vocational Singleness
Waiting for marriage vs. permanently giving up romance + marriage + sex + children for the kingdom
Temporary singles often shallowly invested in community and kingdom work
Jesus and Paul commend vocational singleness
Must step into vocational singleness to receive the gift

[Notes]
But why distinguish between temporary singleness and vocational singleness?

Well, we’re all born into temporary singleness. That’s our default state. And while some of us are called out of temporary singleness into a lifetime vocation of Christian marriage, some of us are called out of temporary singleness into a lifetime vocational of singleness. 

You see, there’s a big difference between the singleness we’re all born into and experience as children vs. committed, lifetime, vocational singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work.
There’s a big difference between just waiting for marriage vs. accepting a call to permanently give up the possibility of romance, marriage, sex, and children in order to use that availability to do kingdom work that parents can’t.

Additionally, those who continue indefinitely in temporary singleness are likely to be shallowly rooted in their spiritual families and uncommitted to the kingdom work they’re doing because they have to stay prepared to reorganize their lives around a (potential) spouse at any moment.
Plus, the two passages where Jesus and Paul encourage every Christian to consider singleness aren’t commending temporary singleness--they’re commending vocational singleness.
In order to receive the gift from God to do vocational singleness well, we have to step out of temporary singleness and into committed singleness.

DISCERNMENT


[Notes]
Okay, so there’s a difference between temporary and vocational singleness
I’ve got a sense of how to do temporary singleness well
But why should I discern? And how do I discern?






Everyone should discern vocational singleness and Christian marriage
Why? Because God has a preference
Where? Matt 19 + 1 Cor 7
A vocation should not be forced
Discernment

[Notes]
Everyone should discern this question of vocational singleness or Christian marriage
We should all open-handedly offer these possibilities to God and seek His preference
Why?

God calls us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness
the Bible teaches that our vocation is given or called, not chosen
God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us

Where does Scripture teach this?
In Matthew 19, verse 11, in his response to the disciples’ shock about his high standard for marriage, Jesus says that only those to whom the calling of marriage has been given will accept his teachings about marriage. And then in verse 12, Jesus says that only those to whom the calling of vocational singleness has been given will accept his teachings about vocational singleness.
Jesus says that God calls us to either marriage or vocational singleness, and God gives us a gift to thrive in that vocation
Then in 1 Corinthians 7 verse 7, Paul says that he wishes all were like him—all were called to vocational singleness—but God has given each his own gift. God has called some to vocational singleness. God has called others to marriage.

Our preference does not matter
We can share our preference with God, but ultimately we should learn what God’s preference is and ask Him to conform our desires to His desires

Now, you might point out that in verse 12 Jesus says that some “choose” the vocation of singleness.
Doesn’t that contradict what we’re saying here?
Actually, we agree that one’s relational vocation should be entered into voluntarily.
No one should be forced into marriage or forced into singleness.
But this doesn’t mean that all that matters is our own preference or desire.
This doesn’t mean that we only have to be single or married if we really want to.
Christ’s teachings make it clear that God has a call for us and that we should obey that call.
God intends for our preference to be conformed to His preference.
But no one should be forced into celibacy before their will has aligned with God’s, just as no one should be forced into a marriage without being called to it and recognizing that call.
Jesus’s use of the word “chosen” should be a clear admonishment of anyone being forced into a relational vocation if they haven’t discerned that call.






Everyone should discern vocational singleness and Christian marriage
A desire to marry, a desire to be a parent, or difficulty being single doesn’t indicate God’s calling.
Each of us has the same inherent capacity for both marriage and vocational singleness. 
Discernment

[Notes]
now a single person might push back
God has given me a desire to marry
to be a parent
And being single doesn’t come easily to me
I don’t have what it takes to be single for a lifetime
Marriage is natural, but being single for a lifetime is supernatural
Therefore, I don’t need to discern

By that logic—that a desire to marry, a desire to be a parent, or a difficulty being single tells us we’re called to marriage—the only people who are called to vocational singleness are asexual people.
Clearly that was not Christ’s intention

And more practically, we should discern and settle down into either marriage or vocational singleness because none of us have what we need inherently to thrive in Christian marriage or vocational singleness

Does the average Christian automatically possess everything they need to thrive in vocational singleness? No.
But the same is true of marriage. We don’t have what we need to do marriage well either.
In light of the Fall, romance, sex, and polygamy are natural.
Each of us has the same inherent but incomplete capacity for both vocational singleness and marriage
But to do either well, we must step into that vocation and receive an additional gift to do it well

Scripture speaks of a gift, a provision of grace to do each of those well.
Scripture does not teach—and the Church has not taught—that God provides this same kind of special gift for those in temporary singleness.
Christians have historically understood these gifts of marriage and vocational singleness to involve both a willingness to accept the call and a provision to thrive in the call.

A common interpretation of 1 Corinthians 7:9 is that poor sexual stewardship in singleness shows that one has not been given the gift of singleness and should instead marry.
Now, it’s more accurate to read this as a specific rebuke of Corinthian Christians who had adopted quasi-gnostic ideas that the real us was our mind and spirit
That our bodies were these gross containers we are stuck in for a lifetime but would be thrown away
So it didn’t matter if we mistreated our bodies
As a result, some of these Corinthian Christians were claiming to be celibate in spirit but then engaging in unrestrained sexual immorality because the body didn’t matter
Regardless, the general principle holds true: it is unwise to walk the path of a vocation of singleness without the gift to do it well.
But the same could be said of marriage: it is unwise to engage in some of the activities of marriage without God’s provision that comes from taking marriage vows and stepping into that vocation fully.

As mentioned earlier, none of us inherently have what we need to do marriage or celibacy well. We will not receive the portion of grace to do either of those vocations until we accept the call and step into the vocation as God designed it.

What hesitations do you have to inviting every Christian to discern between vocational singleness and marriage?

5 Ingredients for Wise Discernment
Grow your ”spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Remove any emotional or theological barriers to clear discernment
Consider what kind of work you might be called to
Consider your past and current circumstances
Seek support from your church
Discernment

[Notes]
so what does it look like to ask God this question
to give God a chance
to discern?

Here’s 5 suggestions

Grow your ”spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Do you know how to bring a question before God, consider Scripture, consider practical aspects of your question, seek advice from spiritual mentors, arrive at a potential conclusion, hold that conclusion before God, seek confirmation through small steps, and move forward with confidence?
Before we ask a question as important as marriage or vocational singleness, let’s practice our skills of discernment on less consequential decisions.
A good book on this is God’s Voice Within

Then, remove any emotional or theological barriers to clear discernment
You need to make sure you have a healthy theological understanding of both vocational singleness and marriage so that you aren’t biased against either
And work through an emotional barriers: fear of marriage because of a family history of divorce or an idolatry of romance

Consider what kind of work you might be called to, and see if that points you toward vocational singleness or marriage
If you feel like the primary work you’ve been called to is to raise children for the Church, then you’re probably called to marriage
Or if you feel called to a mission that might be mutually exclusive with raising children
Like a special mission, a difficult ministry, a life of contemplation or study, or monastic life, then you’re probably called to vocational singleness

Consider your past and current circumstances
Have any experiences from your past pointed you toward one vocation or another?
Or perhaps you find yourself single later in life and ask, “I am still single not by accident, but because God has called me to vocational singleness?”
I’m not saying that every adult who is single later in life has been called to vocational singleness
But perhaps if someone is single later in life, that is a sign of God’s intentions

Seek support from your church in the discernment process. Invite mentors to lead you in this process. Get feedback from friends and family about your discernment. These people can  can often provide better advice with an outside perspective.

Christian vocation - a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children

[Notes]
Remember, we said a Christian vocation is generally a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision. 

Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children






Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.

Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Let’s break down that definition of vocational singleness

What is Vocational Singleness?
The denominations that represent a majority of Christians today and throughout time have consistently understood Scripture to teach the following about our relational vocations: All Christians are first born into a period of temporary singleness during which they deepen in their relationships with God and others AND discern whether God is calling them to vocational singleness or Christian marriage. A Christian vocation is generally a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision. Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.







“a lifetime calling…”
God calls us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness.
God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us.
God intended for vocational singleness to be committed and permanent.
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling...
It’s a calling. God eventually calls most of us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness. We’ve already talked about the fact that the Bible teaches that our vocation is given or called, not chosen. God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us. And sometimes, God’s preference doesn’t match our preference.  Proverbs 16:9 tells us that our hearts plan our course, but it’s God who directs our path.  And it’s our responsibility to submit to His direction.
Everyone should open-handedly offer this question of vocational singleness or Christian marriage to God, and everyone has the same inherent capacity for both vocations. 
 
But it’s not just a calling. It’s a lifetime calling.
God intends for vocational singleness to be committed and permanent. In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus speaks of a call beyond temporary singleness and compares vocational singleness to being a eunuch, a state which is permanent. We cannot imagine Jesus providing the 100-fold blessing promised in Luke 18:28-30 to someone who has only temporarily given up the prospect of marriage and children, only to later get married. In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul recognizes and praises committed singleness and teaches that it is better to keep a commitment to vocational singleness than get married. Then in 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul reaffirms that a commitment to vocational singleness is good and to break that commitment is a sin.

PLUS EARLY CHURCH UNDERSTANDING







“a lifetime calling to singleness…”
A call to give up romance, dating, marriage, and sex
Still a call to intimacy in the context of committed family
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness...
Vocational singleness is a call to give up romance, dating, marriage, sex, and children, but that doesn’t mean that a person is called to loneliness. In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus talks about vocational singleness as a giving up of romance, marriage, sex, and children. And then in Luke 18:28-30, Jesus promises a 100-fold of brothers, sisters, and children now in this present time to those who give up the potential for a spouse and children for the sake of the kingdom. In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul confirms that vocational singleness involves giving up sex, romance, marriage, and children but recognizes that those called to vocational singleness still need committed companionship.
But, vocational singleness is still a call to intimacy in the context of committed family. In Isaiah 56:3-5, the celibate is promised family, belonging, and honor equal to the married person, that they will be full and equal members of the family of God, that they will be spiritual parents in ways just as great as biological parents. In Luke 18:28-30, Jesus promises a 100-fold of brothers, sisters, and children now in this present time to those who give up the potential for a spouse and children for the sake of the kingdom. In 1 Cor 7:36-38, Paul recognizes that those called to celibacy still need committed companionship by commending the now-outlawed spiritual betrothals present in the early Church. Then in 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul recognizes early families of celibate people by commending a committed community of celibate women.
Now that we know what vocational singleness is, now let’s explore why God calls some people to this lifetime vocation of singleness.



Share



What’s lacking in the evidence from Scripture and the early Church that the singleness Jesus and Paul spoke of was intended to be permanent?

How might a permanent giving up of romance and dating free those called to vocational singleness to focus on kingdom work and their spiritual family?

[Notes]








“a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom”
Do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time and energy to do
Embody the gospel in unique ways
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Why does God call some to Vocational Singleness?
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.
Jesus uses the phrase “for the sake of the kingdom” in Matthew 19:1-12 and Luke 18:28-30 to describe vocational singleness. Those called to vocational singleness live “for the sake of the kingdom” in three ways:
God intended for those in vocational singleness to use their availability, primarily from not raising children, to do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time, energy, or financial freedom to do. In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus invites his disciples to consider giving up the potential for spouse and children in order to live “like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom,” referring to Old Testament eunuchs who commonly worked for a king, managing and building up the king’s kingdom. In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul explains that vocational singleness involves giving up a spouse and children to be more concerned with the work of the Church. In 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul commends faithful members of the community of celibate women who have fully committed themselves to the Lord.
Vocational singleness is for the sake of the kingdom because it embodies the gospel. Similarly to marriage, vocational singleness is an image of the love found in God’s family (the Trinity and between Christ and the Church), preaching the gospel by reflecting that love. Vocational singleness is spiritually procreative, sacrificial, committed, intimate, and hospitable, pointing those who see that image back to the original source: God’s love.






Diverse – differentness of personalities, sexes, ages
Intimate – still a call to family, fullness of God’s love in NHNE
Faithful – permanent and lifetime, consistent kingdom work
Vocational singleness is…
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Now, let’s look at the ways singleness for the sake of the kingdom embodies those six characteristics of love found in the Trinity and between Christ and His Church.


1. Vocational singleness is diverse. The friendships enjoyed by those committed to vocational singleness reflect the diversity in God’s family. There is a differentness between the persons in each friendship. Plus, vocational singles still need healthy relationships with people of the opposite sex, parents, and children. Vocational singleness is still a call to a diversity of friendships with people of all ages and stages of life. This differentness points observers back to the complementarity in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church as well as the unity found in the body of Christ even amidst differences.

2. Vocational singleness is intimate. As already mentioned, vocational singleness is still a call to intimacy in the context of family. Jesus and Paul recognize vocational singles’ need for committed companionship and promise a 100-fold of family in this lifetime (reference). This intimacy points observers back to the intimacy in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church. The family vocational singles enjoy testifies to the fullness of God’s love and gives every Christian hope for how we will all live in the New Heavens and New Earth.

3. Vocational singleness is faithful. The permanent, lifetime nature of a commitment to vocational singleness reflects the faithfulness of God’s love found in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church. Through this vocation, those called faithfully live out their singleness for the Lord consistently build up the kingdom in ways that point back to the faithfulness of the love in God’s family.







Life-giving – spiritually procreative and more kingdom work
Sacrificial – give up idol of romance to follow Jesus
Hospitable – offer family to lonely
Vocational singleness is…
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
4. Vocational singleness is life-giving. While those called to vocational singleness do not bear biological children, their availability for kingdom works should bear the fruit of many times more spiritual children. The vocationally single have the time and energy to share the gospel with more not-yet-believers and mentor more new Christians than parents can. Plus, those called to vocational singleness reflect the procreative nature of God’s love by building up the kingdom and bringing spiritual life to the Church.

5. Vocational singleness is sacrificial. At first glance, those called to vocational singleness have chosen to give up their right to some of our culture’s most coveted experiences: romance, dating, marriage, and sex. The sacrifice of vocational singles points observers back to the sacrificial nature of the love in God’s family.

6. Vocational singleness is hospitable. Those called to vocational singleness have the unique opportunity to offer family to those on the margins without the need to compete for belonging. This hospitality reflects the welcoming nature of the love in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church.






“a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom”
Do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time and energy to do
Embody the gospel in unique ways
Give every Christian hope for the New Heavens and New Earth 
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Vocational singleness is for the sake of the kingdom because it gives every Christian hope for the New Heavens and New Earth. In Luke 20:34-36, Jesus teaches that all will be celibate in the New Heaven and New Earth. So vocational singleness preaches the gospel in way that marriage does not by serving as a physical sign and hope for how we will all live in the NHNE. 
Contemporaries of early Christians saw marriage as a necessity to secure physical protection, wealth, and a legacy through descendants. So when Christians called to vocational singleness fulfilled the promises in Isaiah 56:3-5 and Luke 18:29 by experiencing more family, more belonging, and more honor than married people, they provided Christians with a preview of and hope for a New Heavens and New Earth where God would keep us safe, provide everything we needed, and would never forget us. 
But today, westerners seem interested in romance and marriage because they promise a way to find faithful love and escape loneliness. So modern Christian vocational singleness can uniquely testify to the fullness of God’s love by previewing a time when we don’t have to compete—to be more attractive or intelligent or funny than others—in order to be loved by others and belong in a family. Christians today should look at those in vocational singleness, see them enjoying intimate community without the need for romance, exclusivity, or competing for each others’ affection; and that preview should give every Christian hope for the fullness of God’s love in the kingdom to come.






Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.

vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom

This comes from Isaiah 56:3-5, Matthew 19:1-12, Luke 18: 28-30, Luke 20: 34-36, 1 Corinthians 7: 1-40, and 1 Timothy 5: 5-15

The best book on this is Max Thurian’s Marriage and Celibacy

Vocational singleness is a lifetime call to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.
It is supposed to be a vocation that is just as beautiful as marriage, both practically and theologically. Isaiah 56:3-5 promises those called to vocational singleness family, belonging, and honor equal to married people, that they will be full and equal members of the family of God, and that they will be spiritual parents in ways just as great as biological parents. In Matthew 19:1-12 Jesus suggests that the average Jew should now consider vocational singleness, lifting up vocational singleness from being an exceptional vocation for only a few to an equally normative calling for the average Christian. In Luke 18:28-30 Jesus promises an 100-fold blessing to those called to vocational singleness, suggesting it is equal, if not greater. And in 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul shows a preference for vocational singleness and describes it as practically superior.

Christian Vocation



Christian vocation - a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children

[Notes]
Remember, we said a Christian vocation is generally a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision. 

Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children



Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children.

[Notes]
Now let’s talk about Christian marriage





Christian Marriage



Christian marriage…
Christian marriage is joined, entered into, and sustained by God in ways other marriages are not.

[Notes]
Christian marriage
Christian = joined, entered into, and sustained by God
Christian marriage is not just natural marriage as God designed at Creation
Christian marriage is natural marriage plus a gospel purpose revealed by Christ’s life, death, and resurrection
God does not join, enter into, or sustain a non-Christian marriage in the same way He does a Christian marriage





Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment…
Matthew 5:32, Romans 7:2-3, and 1 Cor 7:10-11,39 provide no grounds for divorce

[Notes]
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment
God expects that our vows to our spouse be permanent.
In Matthew 19, Jesus calls God’s people back to lifelong monogamy, declaring that Moses allowed the Jewish people to divorce, giving them over to their broken desires, because their hearts were hardened to God and His created intention. Then Jesus seemingly provides an exception to this high standard of permanence, but other presentations of this episode in other Gospels lack this exception, and Jesus teaches clearly in Matthew 5:32 that if you marry someone who has been divorced, you commit adultery, without any exception. Paul confirms Christ’s teachings in Romans 7:2-3 and 1 Corinthians 7:10-11, 39 that there are no biblical grounds for divorce. Scholars argue that this exception in Matthew 19 is more likely allowing for separation without remarriage or referring to dissolving a false marriage: marriages entered into under false pretenses, a marriage never consummated, or a marriage to a concubine (1 Corinthians 5:1, Acts 15:20, Acts 15:29). 

Regardless, Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment, no exceptions





Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman…
God instituted natural marriage between one man and one woman, confirmed by Jesus and Paul

[Notes]
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman
God instituted natural marriage in Genesis 2, clearly defining marriage as between one man and one woman and established sex difference as part of what makes a marriage. In Matthew 19, Jesus reaffirms God’s original intentions for monogamous, lifelong marriage between one man and one woman. In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul does the same, stating that each husband should have only one wife, and each wife have only one husband. Then in Ephesians 5, Paul teaches that the sexual difference in Christian marriage is meant to reflect to differentness in Christ’s relationship with the Church.





Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children.
God’s procreation mandate stands for those called to Christian marriage

[Notes]
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children
I want to be clear, raising children is not the only good thing enjoyed in marriage, but it is in particular what sets it apart from vocational singleness
Obviously, just like vocational singleness, it is a call to embody the gospel and enjoy healthy intimacy

But since the beginning of time, marriage was meant to be a space to raise children. In Genesis 1: 28, God commands the first marriage to “be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.” This procreation mandate is affirmed in Genesis 9 and Psalm 127. Raising children is a central purpose of Christian marriage, and God’s command for Christian marriages to raise children was never rescinded.(note, I’ve been careful to say raise children, and not necessarily have children. As a rule, a Christian marriage is a space to raise children, whether that be one’s own or as foster or adoptive parents. While infrequent, there are always exceptions to the rule.)

For those who are called to marriage, they should recognize that marriage will be one of the most difficult things they do

Why does it matter?



Both are about embodying the gospel:
Diverse, intimate, and procreative relationships maintained by commitment, sacrifice, and hospitality point to the Trinity and Christ + the Church
Vocational singleness reflects Christ’s life and future patterns in the New Heaven and New Earth

[Notes]
Why it is so important that we get that right? 
they are both ultimately about embodying the gospel and that makes it a gospel issue
all: we are all made for diverse, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment, sacrifice, and hospitality that ultimately point to God’s love in the Trinity and for His people
Vocational singleness: reflects christ’s life and our future patterns in the NHNE



Why Follow?




If a god exists, he’s the God of the Bible, and that God knows what is best for us—we’d be fools not to follow God’s wisdom

God’s wisdom will lead us to the deepest experiences of joy and purpose and true pleasure in this life

[Notes]
Why follow God’s wisdom?
Why follow God’s wisdom about intimacy and family? God seems to have a lot of rules for how we should seek out intimacy and family. Living your life according to that wisdom seems inconvenient. Why follow God’s wisdom?

If we believe that a god exists, if we believe that god is the God of the Bible, and if we believe that God knows what is best for us—if we really believe all of those things, we would be fools not to follow God’s wisdom.
If Lebron James was your basketball coach and you ignored his advice about how to become a better basketball player, you’d be a fool!
How much better advice does God have about the ways to enjoy the most goodness and beauty and meaning in this life? Trust Him!

We have been designed, by God, for specific purposes. That matters. We shouldn’t be surprised that when we allow ourselves to live in ways we weren’t designed to, we get hurt. We shouldn’t be surprised that when we use romance, marriage, and sex contrary to God’s design, it brings pain to our lives.

If God’s wisdom is best for us, following His teachings will save us from unnecessary pain of figuring out the best paths through trial and error. Plus, God’s wisdom will lead us to the deepest experiences of joy and purpose and true pleasure in this life.




What about the gays?



If the Church did this well, it would be a place where gay people could thrive in vocational singleness or a mixed-orientation marriage (MOM).

Their callings would be just as beautiful, and the challenges would be no greater.

[Notes]
what does that mean for gay people
why does God’s narrative for sexual stewardship matter to us?

if the Church did this well
It would be a place where gay people could thrive in vocational singleness or marriage with someone of the opposite sex (just like straight people!)
calling just a beautiful and challenges no greater

God’s narrative says that for every person, the most good will be found in a period of temporary singleness, vocational singleness, or marriage with someone of the opposite sex done correctly

We’ve got to become churches where vocational singleness taught and valued and just as good
other straight people walking out vocational singleness and thriving
church that recognizes brokenness and talks about brokenness of sexuality
also recognizes what marriage really is
so can thrive in MOM

What about this narrative is challenging? How does it contrast with the narrative of sexual fulfillment offered by culture and many churches?

How is this narrative good and beautiful and compelling for LGBT+ people?

THE PROBLEM


[Notes]
but that assumes that the Church is doing this well
news story: We AREN'T
where are our areas of growth?
we can’t get better until we admit we have a problem and we identify them




The Problem(s)



God gave me desires to marry and have kids because He wants me to get married.
Marriage is about companionship and mutual fulfillment.
We only have to have kids if and when we want them.
God calls a select few to vocational singleness and sustains them spiritually.
Friendship can’t provide what marriage can and shouldn’t be too close.

[Notes]
So, what does the Church really believe today?



The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
Straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage
There is no support for vocational singleness
We live disconnected, isolated lives

[Notes]
What are the results of having those beliefs?

we don’t refrain from emotional and physically intimate relationships before marriage
we assume we will be married, that marriage will satisfy, and that marriage is about making you happy
we no longer honor “through thick and thin” or see raising children as central
straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage

few consider vocational singleness as a calling
relegated to a curse of loneliness for the sake of the gospel
there is no support for vocational singleness because no straight people aren't doing it

don’t learn to do friendship well, have loose friendships
fear of close, same-sex friendships
don’t do life as a Body of Christ



The Problem(s)



This hurts Christians who experience same-sex attraction
Cannot thrive in vocational singleness or a MOM
We offer only Side A or Side X
Why should gay people be called to a higher standard of sexual stewardship?

[Notes]
these things hurt Christians who experience same-sex attraction
few churches are places where those who experience same-sex attraction can truly thrive in vocational singleness or a mixed orientation marriage (MOMs have been attacked for the past decade)
we offer Side A and Side X
we don’t offer an alternative that recognizes the challenges and answers questions people have
if we do not do this, we cannot blame unmarried people for reaching out for forbidden things from a place of loneliness
if straight people aren’t taking marriage seriously or considering vocational singleness, why should gay people call themselves to a higher standard of sexual stewardship?
the solution starts with straight married people stewarding their sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic
If straight people really believed these things and lived them out, there would be support for vocational singleness and MOMs



The Problem(s)



This hurts straight Christians, too
Children grow up hearing all people will be straight, married, and have kids
Failed marriages due to refusing a call to vocational singleness and inaccurate expectations
Vocational singles struggle with loneliness and married people raise children alone

[Notes]
important for straight people
children are hearing that all people will be straight, married, with kids
but for many than won’t be the case
many failed marriages due to refusing a call to vocational singleness
and not accurately seeing marriage as a vocation that is lifelong and difficult
marriages would endure if we communicated more accurate expectations
Celibates struggle with loneliness and married people raise children alone
those called to vocational singleness need to see vocational singleness valued/celebrated and thriving modeled
and married people need help with kids from healthy celibates



The Problem(s)



Many people and circumstances on the margins:
Divorce
Widowing
Infertility
Pornography
Masturbation
Fornication
Adultery
Abortion
Contraception
Same-sex attraction
Broken gender

[Notes]
And same-sex attraction is just one of the ways that God’s perfect intentions for human intimacy is bent
there are lots of people and circumstances on the margins
there are lots of ways that the way we do intimacy is broken

divorce
widowing
infertility
pornography (lust, objectification, selfish, commodification)
masturbation
sex outside of marriage
adultery
abortion
contraception
same-sex attraction
broken gender

Some but not all of these are due to individual sin
But these are all communal sins that require a communal responses

So talking theologically about how God has invited us to steward our sexualities doesn’t just help us to answer the question of same-sex marriage
It can also help us respond to each of these areas of brokenness
