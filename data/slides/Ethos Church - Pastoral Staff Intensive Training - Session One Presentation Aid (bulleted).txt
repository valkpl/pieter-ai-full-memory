Questions Equip Nashville cannot answer:

Should gay persons be allowed in leadership?
How should we respond to transgender and transsexual people?

This is about understanding and skills—not concluding debates that will continue far beyond

Broad Application to any issues of sexual and relational brokenness
greater confidence to minister to those who don’t experience same-sex attraction

Bringing into light makes others laden with shame more comfortable

pornography, sex outside of marriage, adultery, divorce, sexual addiction, sexual abuse, codependency, and gender/identity issues.
