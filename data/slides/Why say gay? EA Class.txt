[Notes]
Before we jump into what words faithful Christians who experience same-sex attraction can use to describe their experience, we need to sync on some more fundamental concepts and definitions






What is same-sex attraction?
Is it a temptation? The result of original sin? Concupiscence? Sinful? A sin?
Are those with same-sex attraction morally guilty? Should they feel guilty?

Concepts & Definitions

[Notes]
What do I mean when I use the phrase same-sex attraction?
Is same-sex attraction a temptation?
The result of original sin? Concupiscence?
Sinful? A sin?
Are those with same-sex attraction morally guilty? Should they feel guilty?







Same-sex attraction is…
a temptation
a result of original sin
not concupiscence
not a sin
not guilty merely by experiencing temptation
Same-sex attraction

[Notes]
In short, I use the phrase same-sex attraction to mean a temptation and a result of original sin. But same-sex attraction is not concupiscence, it is not a sin, and gay Christians are not guilty merely by experiencing temptation. To answer these questions fully, we must first define attraction, sin, temptation, original sin, and guilt.







God-given impulses toward good things God created
Sexual attraction - unite w/ opposite sex in self-giving way & open to children
Physical attraction - recognize physical beauty
Relational attraction - platonic friendship
What is healthy desire?

[Notes]
Augustine of Hippo’s discussion of desire and Thomas Aquinas’s discussion of passions provide the foundation for our understanding of attraction. Augustine and Aquinas argue that healthy desires/passions are God-given impulses toward good things God created. Healthy sexual attraction is a God-given desire to unite with an opposite-sex spouse in a self-giving way that is open to children. Healthy physical attraction is a God-given capacity to recognize physical beauty. Healthy relational attraction is a God-given desire for platonic friendship with another person.







Evil is a privation/perversion of good, choosing a lesser good, or misusing good

Temptation – invitation to choose lesser good or misuse good
What is temptation?

[Notes]
Nothing exists that God has not created, and everything that God creates is good; therefore, evil has no positive existence in itself, but must always be a privation or perversion of something good. We sin when we choose a lesser good over a greater good or misuse some created good in a self-serving way.
 
Temptation, then, is an invitation to choose a lesser good over a greater good or misuse a created good in a self-giving way






Sexual temptation – desiring a person with whom one cannot enter a legitimate sexual union
Physical temptation – desire to selfishly misuse the beauty of another
Relational temptation – desire to sexualize friendship
Specific temptations…

[Notes]
. Sexual attractions become temptation when they are directed toward an improper object (a person with whom one cannot enter into a legitimate sexual union). Physical attractions can become temptation when the beauty of another is selfishly misused as an object of lust. Relational attractions can become temptation when a desire for friendship is sexualized.

WHY ARE THESE DEFINITIONS IMPORTANT?
If temptation/sin are always a perversion/privation/misuse of healthy desire/something good
Then the solution isn’t just to say NO
It’s to meet the need in healthy ways
It’s to say YES to the right things
REMEMBER THIS




Share



Evil is always a perversion/privation of the good, so the solution to evil isn’t just to say no to the wrong things but also to say yes to the right things.

How does this concept shift your approach to temptation and stewardship?

[Notes]
If temptation/sin are always a perversion/privation/misuse of healthy desire/something good
Then the solution isn’t just to say NO
It’s to meet the need in healthy ways
It’s to say YES to the right things







Original sin – loss of original righteousness, inclined/tend toward volitional sin, corruption & imperfection at every level

Free will has been weakened, not destroyed, desire + capacity for good remains
Original vs. Willful Sin

[Notes]
Original sin refers to the fallen state of all humanity. Because of Adam’s sin, we have lost our original righteousness and, apart from God’s grace, our choices tend toward sin. On an individual level, original sin is a corruption and imperfection starting at our formation in the womb on a spiritual and physical level, inclining us to volitionally commit sins.
 
Free will has been weakened by original sin, but not destroyed. We do not have the capacity to choose or live perfectly, but a desire for good and a capacity to make good decisions remains inherent to the bent-but-not-destroyed image of God in each of us. When a person willfully sins, the person has fallen short of God’s standard of perfection and deserves punishment, referred to as guilt. A healthy response to this guilt is a feeling of inner turmoil, often referred to as “feeling guilty.”

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
Because we still have free will, choice
There is a different between temptation and sin
Our agency, our willfulness matters







A person has not committed actual sin when tempted, no guilt, no need to feel guilty or confess

We sin when we say yes in thought, word, or deed + ought to feel guilty and confess
Temptation vs. Sin

[Notes]
However, a person is not guilty and does not need to feel guilty for being tempted. We are not committing actual sin when we are tempted. We are not responsible for our involuntary thoughts. While we need to recognize daily that we are fallen and need a savior, we do not need to confess or repent of specific temptations. 
 
When we say “yes” to a temptation in thought, word, or deed, we have sinned. When we participate in the temptation, when we step toward the temptation in any way, we have crossed the line from temptation to sin. We have done something for which it would be healthy to feel inner turmoil. We have done something that we need to confess and repent of.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
We need to know when to accept responsibility
When to label as healthy guilt or unhealthy shame
When to accept culpability and when to push again Satan’s false accusations







Sinful action – sinful is used to modify an evil deed, guilty of sin

Sinful desire/temptation – sinful is used to modify a temptation or desire connected to a sinful action, but if resists has not sinned
Sin vs. Sinful

[Notes]
Sinful can be used to modify an action to describe an evil deed. When a person performs a sinful action, the individual is guilty of sin. Sinful can also be used to modify a temptation or desire connected to a sinful action. When a person experiences a sinful desire or temptation but resists, the individual has not sinned. But when the person capitulates to a sinful desire or temptation, the individual has sinned.

WHY IMPORTANT
Because Christians often use this word sinful in unclear ways
Are you saying related to something broken, or a sin in itself?






Lust – saying yes to sexual temptation in thought, may become seemingly automatic if habit of indulging

Concupiscence (epithumia) – lustful desire, active participation in temptation

Lust & Concupiscence

[Notes]
Specifically, when we say “yes” to a sexual temptation in thought, this is frequently called lust. Lust is a sin. For some, if they have been in the habit of indulging sexual temptations by lusting, moving from temptation to lust may become automatic such that it is difficult to distinguish between the sexual temptation and the sin of lust.

The Greek word epithumia, most directly translated as concupiscence, is used in the Bible generally to refer to healthy desire and more narrowly to refer to lustful desire. In contexts when epithumia describes something illicit, it is consistently contained in a list of actions or contextualized in a way that assumes the individual is actively participating in a temptation.

How are these definitions of desire, temptation, original sin, willful sin, sinful, lust, and concupiscence the same or different than those you’ve been offered in the past?






Same-sex attractions are…
desires for healthy same-sex friendship that have been sexualized
Temptation to selfishly objectify the beauty of someone of the same sex, engage in same-sex sexual activity, or lust after someone of the same sex
SSA Definition

[Notes]
Same-sex attractions, as I define them, are primarily desires for healthy same-sex friendship that have been sexualized. They are a temptation to selfishly objectify the beauty of someone of the same sex, engage in same-sex sexual activity, or lust after someone of the same sex. Same-sex attractions are the result of original sin, an inborn distortion of healthy desires for same-sex friendship.






Same-sex attractions are not…
A perversion of opposite-sex attractions
A pre-fall desire for same-sex romance unique to gay people

Gay Christians can proactively resist temptation by pursuing healthy same-sex friendship

SSAs are not

[Notes]
Clearly identifying the healthy desires that same-sex attraction are a distortion of can provide clarity for the most effective ways to respond to these temptations, because satisfying the true need can temporarily reduce the broken desire. Same-sex attractions are not a perversion of healthy sexual desire to unite with an opposite-sex spouse in a self-giving way that is open to children.
Decreased OSAs is a separate topics

Nor are same-sex attractions a sexualization of a pre-fall desire for same-sex romance unique to gay people. Instead, same-sex attractions are healthy desires for same-sex friendship that have been sexualized. In light of this distinction, what healthy desires should the gay Christian seek to fulfill to most faithfully resist same-sex attractions? Ardently pursuing opposite-sex marriage or seeking same-sex romantic companionship are unlikely to provide escape from the temptations of same-sex attraction. Instead, pursuing healthy same-sex friendship will satisfy the healthy desires distorted by same-sex attraction and will most effectively aid the gay Christian in resisting temptation.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
separate OSAs and SSAs, not perversion of OSAs + not a perversion of pre-fall reality
If SSAs were just a perversion of OSAs or of a pre-fall gay reality, then the solution would be opposite-sex marriage or gay romance

But OSAs are not a perversion of OSAs
And SSAs are not what God intended
They don’t reflect a pre-fall reality, but instead are a perversion of universal appreciate of same-sex beauty and friendship
(but its not a sin and people don't need to feel guilty)
So the solution is to lean into healthy same-sex friendship

Remember we said that If temptation/sin are always a perversion/privation/misuse of healthy desire/something good
Then the solution isn’t just to say NO
It’s to meet the need in healthy ways
It’s to say YES to the right things

the solution to SSAs isn't marriage or celibate partnership, its healthy friendship




Share



SSAs are not perversion of OSAs or pre-fall gay design, so the solution is healthy same-sex friendship, not opposite-sex marriage or gay romance?

How does this understanding compare to your assumptions before today?






Therefore, gay Christians are not sinning merely by being tempted with same-sex attraction, do not need to feel guilt/confess/repent
SSAs are not sin

[Notes]
Those who experience the temptation of same-sex attractions are not responsible for this brokenness nor do they need to feel inner turmoil or guilt. They are not sinning merely by being tempted with same-sex attraction. They do not need to confess or repent of same-sex attractions. God does not condemn a person to Hell merely for experiencing same-sex attraction.






When individuals say yes to same-sex attraction in thought, word, or deed, they have sinned, ought to feel guilt + confess/repent

Desire? Lust? Temptation? Attraction?

Saying yes to SSAs 

[Notes]
But when a person says “yes” to same-sex attractions in thought, word, or deed, they have sinned. When an individual engages in same-sex sexual activity or lusts after a person of the same-sex, they ought to feel inner turmoil and understand that they have done something that they need to confess and repent of.

The words desire, lust, temptation, and attraction are often used inexactly as they relate to same-sex attractions. Some use the word desire interchangeably with lust. Others use desire to mean both temptation and lust. Because of this confusion, I tend to avoid the word desire and more clearly speak same-sex attractions as temptation and lust as sin.






Is same-sex attraction sinful?
Same-sex romantic and sexual activity is sinful as an action

The temptation of same-sex attraction is sinful, in the sense that it relates to a sinful action, but experiencing temptation but resisting is not actual sin
Are SSAs sinful?

[Notes]
As same-sex attraction relates to the word sinful, if a person engages in same-sex sexual activity or commits same-sex lust, the individual has sinned. These actions are sinful. Additionally, the temptation of same-sex attraction is sinful, in the sense that it is related to a sinful action. But if a person experiences sinful same-sex attractions and yet resists these temptations, the individual is not guilty of sin.






Same-sex attraction is not concupiscence (because temptation is not lust).

Therefore, gay Christians do not need to daily feel guilt + repent + seek sexual orientation change.


SSAs = concupiscence?

[Notes]
As same-sex attraction relates to concupiscence, the temptation of same-sex attraction is not concupiscence because it is not yet lust. But when those tempted with same-sex attraction willfully choose to lust after someone of the same sex, that lust is concupiscence. For a majority of Christians who believe free will has been weakened but not destroyed, who believe original sin and concupiscence are related but not identical, this distinction is important.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
some of the right argue that SSA = concupiscence and temptations are sin
Painfully false burden of gay people to daily feel guilty of and repent of temptations
and then those on the right argue that (because we shouldn't make peace with sin), gay people must daily seek SOC to be faithful
and must not use a word (gay) than many associate with a recognition of enduring experience








Do I need to FEEL guilty for experiencing SSA? Feel responsible for my SSAs? Feel inner turmoil for my SSAs? Am I sinning merely by being tempted with those attractions? Do I need to confess/repent of those temptations specifically?

NO.
The big questions

[Notes]
Ultimately, I am most frequently asked these questions: “Do I need to FEEL guilty for experiencing same-sex attraction? Should I feel responsible for my same-sex attractions? Should I feel inner turmoil for my same-sex attractions? Am I sinning merely by being tempted with those attractions? Do I need to confess those temptations specifically or repent of those temptations specifically?” To all of these questions, the answer is no.

SSA is not concupiscence, therefore gay Christians don’t need to daily feel guilty + repent + seek change.

IN CHRIST


[Notes]
Many have asked whether use of the phrase gay Christian compromises my “identity in Christ” (note: identity in Christ is a theological concept developed in the 20th century). To evaluate this concern, we must first explore what the Bible has to say about one’s “identity in Christ.”
While no reputable English translations of the Bible use the phrase “identity in Christ,” many believers quickly point to passages like Galatians 3:26-29 as central texts exploring cultural identity in light of Christ’s saving work.






“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants, heirs according to promise.”
Identity & Galatians 3

[Notes]
This is important
We need to get this right
So let’s start with Scripture
Galatians 3:26-29






In Christ = Faith + Baptism

“Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit” (Acts 2:38).


Faith + Baptism?

[Notes]
In verses 26, 27, and 29 Paul describes our identity as “sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus,” who were “baptized into Christ,” and now “belong to Christ” (I will focus specifically on verse 28 later). According to this passage, faith and baptism are all that are required to be in Christ. Similarly, in Acts 2:38, Peter testifies, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”
What does it mean to have faith in Christ Jesus? Why should we be baptized?







What does it mean to have faith in Christ Jesus? Why should we be baptized?

“I believe the Gospel is the truth: that Jesus died for my sins, rose from the dead, and rules over my life. Therefore, I entrust myself to him as my Savior, and I obey him as my Lord” (ACNA Catechism Q12)


How to “have faith”

[Notes]
According to the ACNA Catechism Question 12, having faith “means that I believe the Gospel is the truth: that Jesus died for my sins, rose from the dead, and rules over my life. Therefore, I entrust myself to him as my Savior, and I obey him as my Lord. (Psalm 40:1–10; Proverbs 3:5–8; John 1:9–13; Romans 10:9–10; Hebrews 11:1, 6)” (page 25).
What more is required beyond faith? How do we signal our identity in Christ?







How do we signal our identity in Christ?

“After receiving instruction in the faith, I should be baptized into the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, thus joining his Body, the Church. If I have already been baptized, I should confess my sins…” (ACNA Catechism Q14)

How to signal faith?

[Notes]
Question 14 of the ACNA Catechism asks, “What should you do as the sign of your repentance and faith?” and answers, “After receiving instruction in the faith, I should be baptized into the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, thus joining his Body, the Church. If I have already been baptized, I should confess my sins, seek the guidance of a minister, affirm the promises made at my Baptism, and take my place as a member of the Church. (Psalm 51:5–7; Ezekiel 36:25–27; Matthew 28:19–20; 1 Corinthians 12:13; 1 Peter 3:18–22)” (page 26).
Beyond faith in Christ and baptism to signal our identity in Christ, must a Christian do or say anything else?






Beyond faith in Christ and baptism to signal our identity in Christ, must a Christian do or say anything else? NO.

“It is by grace [we] have been saved, through faith—and this is not from [ourselves], it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.” (Eph 2:8-10)
What more?

[Notes]
By no means!
Ephesians 2:8-10 reminds us that “it is by grace [we] have been saved, through faith—and this is not from [ourselves], it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.” To be in Christ is to have faith that Jesus will save us, nothing more. Having our identity in Christ is accomplished through Christ’s death and resurrection followed by our faith and baptism. The only words required at our confirmation to secure our identity in Christ are “I do,” “I renounce them,” and “I will, the Lord being my helper” (BCP 2019 pg 177).







God may invite the Christian to much more than just faith and baptism to work out their sanctification…

but all that is necessary to be securely in Christ and to have one’s identity in Christ is faith in Christ and baptism.
Faith + Baptism

[Notes]
God may invite the Christian to much more than just faith and baptism to work out their sanctification, but all that is necessary to be securely “in Christ” and to have one’s “identity in Christ” is faith in Christ and baptism.






Male and female Christians, Jewish and Greek Christians, and enslaved and free Christians continued to live in cultural spaces where they…
were treated differently
worshipped differently
were led differently
saw Jesus differently
Cultural Identity? 

[Notes]
Yet, some point out Galatians 3:28 as a further requirement of true identity in Christ, claiming that Paul is commanding Christians to erase any cultural identity:
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
However, male and female Christians, Jewish and Greek Christians, and enslaved and free Christians continued to live in cultural spaces where each of these statuses mattered. Society observed whether these Christians were male or female, Jewish or Greek, enslaved or free and treated those Christians differently based on their status. These observed cultural identities impacted how they worshipped, who they worshipped with, who could lead, and ultimately how they experienced Jesus.







Paul was not concerned with persisting cultural identities and never indicated that they are incompatible with or challenge the supremacy of Christ in the hearts of believers. 
Cultural Identity? 

[Notes]
Paul did not expect these cultural realities to disappear before one could properly identify in Christ.These Christians did not stop being male and female, Jewish and Greek, or enslaved and free. Paul did not command them to pretend they were not female, not enslaved, or not Greek.  Instead Paul reaffirmed that identity in Christ is accomplished solely through faith in Jesus and baptism. He was not concerned with persisting cultural identities and never indicated that they are incompatible with or challenge the supremacy of Christ in the hearts of believers.

What are some of the groups of people that you feel a part of (cultural identity)? Does that necessarily compete with Jesus?

I need some word or phrase to efficiently name or describe or refer to that part of my story. I’ve chosen to use the phrase gay Christian.

Why?
In Christ + Gay?

[Notes]
I am a sinner, Jesus died and rose again for the sake of all people, and Jesus began that saving work in my life through my baptism. At the same time, I find myself consistently attracted to other people of the same sex. Despite a decade of prayer ministry and conversion therapy, these attractions persist. 
I need some word or phrase to efficiently name or describe or refer to that part of my story. I’ve chosen to use the phrase gay Christian. Why?

4 reasons






8-year-olds: gay is a boy who likes a boy or a girl who likes a girl

Teens + young adults don’t assume anything about theological beliefs or relationship choices
1. Appeal to kids/teens

[Notes]
1. Those I minister to use the word gay in a limited way.
Modern teenagers and young adults use gay differently than previous generations. I’ll speak more in Part 4: Heavy Burdens about the evangelical advantage of using the words I do, but if you ask an 8-year-old today what the word gay means, you will most consistently hear, “a boy who likes a boy” or “a girl who likes a girl.” Teens and young adults today do not assume anything about an individual's theological beliefs or relationship choices when using that word. In the same way, I use gay knowing that those I minister to will not assume my theological beliefs or relationship choices based on that word.






Phenomenological: describing based on what something appears to be
Ontological: naming based on what something is innately, by design

I do not believe God made me gay or that I am fundamentally different than straight people.
2. Phenomenologically

[Notes]
2. I use gay phenomenologically, not ontologically.
When we define something phenomenologically, we are naming something based on one’s experience or what it appears to be. In contrast, when we ask who a person is ontologically, we are asking who they are innately, by design. When I use the word gay, I am not saying that I or someone else is ontologically gay. I am not saying that I am a fundamentally different person or that God designed me to be gay. I am merely noticing that I am attracted to other people of the same-sex and using (in my opinion) the best word to describe that experience. 







I don’t identify with attractions, temptations, brokenness, or sin.

I identify with people who’ve experienced the same loneliness, pain, and specific call to obedience as I have.
3. Identify with people

[Notes]
3. I identify with people of shared experience, not with brokenness or sin.
I use the phrase gay Christian particularly to identify with other Christians who experienced the same shame and loneliness as a kid. I identify with other Christians who have endured the same pain and fearfully offered their whole selves to God. I identify with people of shared experience because more often than not, they are able to empathize with me and care for me best.







In contrast to the idol of romance and entitlement to sexual expression, my story testifies that the life Jesus offers is better, worth it.

No language/term is clear. Clarification provides an opportunity for testimony.
4. To share the gospel

[Notes]
4. I use gay Christian to testify to Christ’s worthiness.
Recognizing my same-sex attractions, submitting that brokenness to God, and collaborating with Him to steward my sexuality in redemptive ways has been the greatest source of blessing and God’s glory in my life. It has been particularly in contrast to the brokenness of my sexuality that the reality and goodness of God is apparent for me. I cannot tell of the fullness of God’s grace and power in my life without mentioning that I am gay. Might some inaccurately assume that gay people are more sexually active than the average straight person? Sure. But then the power of my testimony only grows. When I share that despite my sexual orientation, Jesus is Lord and I submit to His wisdom for my sexual stewardship because I am convinced His love and wisdom are the source of the truest joy, pleasure, and meaning—when I share all of these while confidently using the word gay, my testimony strengthens.
I am a child of God, first and foremost. Jesus and Jesus alone sits on the throne of my life. Every decision I make must be submitted to His Lordship. Christ demands and deserves my whole life.
And I am gay.
I must use some word to describe and refer to my experience of same-sex attraction. No language or terminology communicates with absolute clarity. I accept the responsibility to ensure I am accurately understood. Whenever I teach, I offer a synopsis of this document. For these reasons, I use the phrase gay Christian.

Won’t hearers assume I’m seeking gay sin?
Americans assume everyone is seeking romance and sex with people they desire
Christians have sex outside of marriage and get divorced at same rates
Unless theological commitments explicitly stated, everyone assumes
1. Assuming sin

[Notes]
Won’t hearers assume that I am seeking out same-sex romantic and sexual activity if I call myself a gay Christian?
It’s true, the average American probably assumes that the average gay person will seek out romantic, and eventually sexual, relationships with people they are drawn to. But they also assume the same of every American, regardless of their sexual orientation. It is assumed that all Americans are seeking out romantic relationships with those they are drawn to with a hope of sexual intimacy, regardless of marital status. Plus, calling oneself a Christian invites the same misunderstanding. It is well documented that Christians have sex outside of marriage and get divorced at the same rates as non-Christians. Unfortunately, the phrase gay Christian is no less clear than the phrase straight Christian or merely using the word Christian. Without specifically stating one’s theological beliefs and commitments (which I do every time I teach), a Christian using any one of those phrases or words would be presumed to be just as sexually immoral as the average American.






Assume God intended me to gay gay?
God didn’t intend me to experience SSA
Brokenness, result of the Fall
Nothing uniquely inherent to being gay other than SSAs
God has been faithful to redeem by growing spiritual gifts
2. Assume God’s plan

[Notes]
2. Couldn’t some conclude that you believe God intended for you to be gay?
When God first imagined me in a perfect world, He did not imagine me with same-sex attraction. He did not intend for me to be gay. I believe that same-sex attraction is a result of the Fall. Same-sex attraction is a brokenness. Additionally, I do not believe there is anything uniquely inherent to being gay other than experiencing same-sex attraction. But God reassures us in Genesis 50:20 that “You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.” As God has redeemed my brokenness for my good and His glory, I have gained spiritual gifts I might not have otherwise, including developing a deeper appreciation and capacity for healthy friendship.







Why identify if not present in heaven?
Scars from Christ’s wounds seen on resurrected body; signs of sin, sacrifice, redemption, and glory
Perhaps gay Christians have continued awareness of differentness as source of God’s glory and our good
3. Gay in heaven?

[Notes]
3. Why identify with something that won’t continue in the next life?
Perhaps it will, in some form. The scars from Christ’s wounds on the cross could still be seen on His resurrected body. Those physical signs of our sin that Christ took on, those physical signs of our redemption through Christ’s sacrifice, remained because they are a sign of God’s glory, not shame. In the same way, a gay Christians may continue to have awareness of that differentness even in the New Heavens and New Earth because it is through that experience that God was most glorified and the most good came to the lives of gay Christians.







What about those who only use SSA?
There should be space for a variety to language
Language & culture change: ministers must be willing to adapt strategies
I use different language in different contexts to accommodate audience
4. But I say SSA

[Notes]
4. What do you think about people who prefer to use same-sex attraction?
I respect those who prefer different language from me. By none of the above do I mean to communicate that every Christian who experiences same-sex attraction should exclusively use the word gay. At the very least, I think there should be space for Christians to call themselves gay. And as I will contend in Part 3, it is my opinion that the most effective term for ministry is the word gay. That being said, language and culture are always changing. The meanings of words and their cultural impact shift. If we are committed to reaching the lost, we have accepted a responsibility to adapt our strategies and hold firm to the truth as the world around us shifts. As a result, I frequently code-switch, using different language in different contexts to accommodate my audience.






Aren’t you making peace with SSA, a sin?
SSA is a temptation, not a sin
Not identifying with sin or temptation
Don’t have to seek sexual orientation change to faithfully steward
5. Isn’t SSA sin?

[Notes]
5. Isn’t merely experiencing same-sex attraction sin in itself? Should that be reason enough not to call yourself gay?
If you’ve not already read the discussion at the end of this document of my definition of the phrase same-sex attraction and questions of sinfulness and concupiescence, please take the time to do so. Thankfully, the Anglican Church in North America, along with the oldest Christian traditions that represent a majority of Christians both in the United States and globally do not teach that Christians sin merely by being tempted. When I experience same-sex attractions yet resist these temptations, I am not guilty of sin.






Why identify as anything but Christian?
Identity in Christ = Faith + Baptism
Critics modify Christian with other words (parent, denomination, region, etc.)
Distinction without a difference
6. Just say Christian

6. Why are you identifying as anything other than Christian?
As the discussion in Part 1 made clear, all that is required to accomplish and sustain my identity in Christ is to have faith in Christ and signal my identity with baptism. The Scriptures do not teach that a Christian’s identity in Christ is compromised by using a noun other than Christian to refer to oneself or using an adjective or clause in a sentence where the person refers to themselves as a Christian. As I have already made clear, Jesus is my only Lord, I submit everything to the Lordship of Christ, and my sexuality is secondary to my primary identity as a Christian. Some have objected to my use of the phrase gay Christian because they believe the word Christian should never be modified. Yet these objectors selectively apply this standard to the word gay while refusing to apply this standard to other cultural identity labels. The provincial website for the ACNA alone uses the phrase Anglican Christian three different times. Yet both my sexuality and the Anglican tradition are broken. Neither are how God first intended. Both involve identifying with sinful people. At the very origins of the Global Anglican Communion is a necessary but broken fracture of the catholic Church. Objections to modifying the word Christian will be perceived as disingenuous until they are applied consistently to all modifiers.
Author Greg Coles who earned his PhD in English studying the rhetorics of marginality has said the following: “English scholars consistently treat adjectives and relative clauses as interchangeable syntactic formations for modifying a noun. Thus, same-sex-attracted Christian (an adjectival modifier of the noun) and Christian who experiences same-sex attraction (a relative clause modifier of the noun) have no meaningful denotative difference. As for gay, most leading English dictionaries (including the Oxford English Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, the American Heritage Dictionary, and Google Dictionary) treat this word as a denotative synonym of attracted to the same sex. There is thus no inherent difference in grammatical meaning between the phrases gay Christian, same-sex-attracted Christian, and Christian who experiences same-sex attraction.”
They are a distinction without a difference.

Some feared eating meat was idol worship; others tempted by reminders of past sin

Paul says eating idol meat is inconsequential
Paul on idol meat

[Notes]
So what’s going on here in 1 Cor 8

Paul adjudicates a dispute about eating meat offered to idols. Some objected merely on the grounds that consuming the meat would be a form of idol worship. Others objected because any activities related to pagan temples tempted them to return to sinful practices from their past life, including temple prostitution.
The Apostle first recognizes that most Christians in Corinth “possess knowledge” that “there is but one God” and that “an idol is nothing.” As a result, eating meat sacrificed to idols was, in itself, inconsequential. If all Christians possessed this knowledge, they might have eaten the idol meat with impunity.






But weaker brothers lacked spiritual maturity, scandalized by cultural messages

Invites stronger brothers to give up freedom to eat idol meat to accommodate weaker brothers


Paul on idol meat

[Notes]
But some weaker brothers lacked the spiritual maturity to grasp this knowledge or the strength to resist reminders of a past life. Paul recognizes that meat offered to idols is morally neutral. Yet powerful cultural messages were causing some to be unnecessarily scandalized by idol meat. These weaker brothers lacked the spiritual maturity to distinguish the cultural meaning of idol meat from the meaninglessness of idol meat in the eyes of God.
To God, it was just meat. But to some Christians deeply embedded in their culture, it was idol worship.

Yet Paul did not condemn the weaker brothers. Instead he invited stronger brothers to love. He cautioned stronger brothers not to exercise their freedom to eat idol meat in ways that caused weaker brothers to be “destroyed”. Paul invites the stronger brothers to accommodate the weaker brother and temporarily give up their freedom to eat idol meat until the weaker brother is able to disentangle cultural meanings from their faith in Jesus.








1 Cor 8 -> sexuality language disagreement?

Growing up, “gay” = group sex parties + AIDS + drugs + hate God

Powerful cultural meaning for older Christians
Gay cultural meaning

[Notes]
How might 1 Corinthians 8 give the Church better understanding of the disagreement about sexual identity language?
When I was growing up, the word gay was used in a very particular way in my church and wider community. Over time, I learned that when most people used this word, they intended for me to imagine group sex parties where all of the attendees had AIDS, were addicted to drugs, and wanted nothing to do with God. That word has a very powerful cultural meaning for many older Christians.







Today, “gay” = SSA, nothing more

But because many Christians taught by culture to interpret gay as indulging in sexual immorality, idol worship…
Gay cultural meaning

[Notes]
I have already shared that most Americans today use that word as a mere recognition of same-sex attractions, and nothing more. Perhaps if every evangelical Christian possessed this knowledge, I could use the phrase gay Christian without scandal.
But there are many Christians in our churches who retain that problematic image of gay people that I was taught growing up. When they hear me using the word gay, they cannot help but assume that I am indulging in sexual immorality.
Unfortunately these Christians have been thoroughly catechized by a particular cultural space to interpret the words I use as idol worship.







Perhaps I should accommodate weaker brothers scandalized by wokeism, identity politics, and political correctness of the cultural right

Perhaps I should cease using gay for the sake of weaker brothers
Gay cultural meaning

[Notes]
Yet Paul’s words convict me. He invites me to accommodate those enamored by the culture war. He invites me to give up my freedom to use the phrase gay Christian for the sake of those scandalized by the wokeism, identity politics, and political correctness of the cultural right.
Perhaps I should temporarily cease using gay Christian around some of my Christian brothers and sisters until they are able to disentangle cultural meanings from their faith in Jesus. Or perhaps there are greater burdens that outweigh the scandal of the weaker brother.

HEAVY
BURDENS


[Notes]
While recognizing Paul’s call to accommodate my weaker brothers by not using the phrase gay Christian, I must also consider what heavy burdens gay people carry. In Luke 11: 37-53, Jesus offers wisdom about these heavy burdens:






When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal. Then the Lord said to him, “Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?
Luke 11: 37-53






But now as for what is inside you—be generous to the poor, and everything will be clean for you. “Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone. “Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.
Luke 11: 37-53






“Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it.” One of the experts in the law answered him, “Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.” Jesus replied, “And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them. “Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them.

Luke 11: 37-53






So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs. Because of this, God in his wisdom said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.’ Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, 
Luke 11: 37-53






who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all. “Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.” When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, waiting to catch him in something he might say.
Luke 11: 37-53






Jesus passes on ritual washing before dinner + Pharisees concerned

Jesus accuses Pharisees of enjoying power and hyper-focusing on ritual laws while failing to care for poor or address injustice
Jesus & the Pharisees

[Notes]
Okay, so what’s going on here?

Jesus joins the Pharisees for dinner, but chooses not to engage in the ritual washing before the meal. The Pharisees are surprised enough for the author to note their concern and for Jesus to respond.
He urges the Pharisees to show more concern for the inside of their bodies (their souls) instead of obsessively washing the outside of their bodies. Jesus accuses the Pharisees of not being generous to the poor and being too distracted by practicing ritual laws to address injustice. He accuses them of enjoying the highest seats of power and respect but bringing destruction to their community through their pride.







Jesus accuses Pharisees of adding new laws that become heavy burden, separating the people from God + unwilling to take practical steps to relieve suffering

Then Pharisees selectively use stories + images of prophets when convenient, but then approving of their murder
Heavy Burdens

[Notes]
Jesus continues by accusing the Pharisees of adding so many new laws to the covenant that the burden of following the laws has become too heavy. These heavy burdens have kept people away from the love and knowledge of God. The legalism of the Pharisees has made it difficult for people to accurately perceive or experience God’s love. Moreover, the Pharisees are unwilling to take practical steps to address the suffering of these same people.
He accuses the Pharisees of selectively using the stories and images of prophets when convenient, but then hypocritically approving of the murder of these same prophets.







Jesus warns that the Pharisees will be punished of persecuting and blocking the people from knowing God

Instead of receiving Christ’s wisdom, the Pharisees interrogate Jesus more
Pharisees Reject

[Notes]
Jesus warns the Pharisees that they will be punished for persecuting innocent men serving God. He concludes that not only have the Pharisees misled themselves, but their legalism and hypocrisy have blocked others from knowing God.
The gospel author reports that after challenging the Pharisees, instead of allowing Christ’s wisdom to convict and reform them, they only questioned him more fiercely, picking apart his every word and “waiting to catch him in something he might say.”

Similarly, previous generations of gay people were given heavy burdens too great to bear, leading many to lose their faith.

Freudian psychoanalysts say gay = mental disorder -> conversation/reparative therapies

Pseudo-science + charismatic elements = ex-gay Christian ministries + SSA term

Shamed if SSAs persist (while compromised on procreation, celibacy, divorce, remarriage)


Gay + Heavy Burdens

[Notes]
In the mid-20th century Freudian psychoanalysts popularized the notion of being gay as a mental disorder. From this pseudo-science grew conversion therapies and reparative therapies that promised to change an individual’s sexual orientation by addressing psychological wounds.
Christian ministries then combined the pseudo-science of Freudian psychoanalysts with charismatic elements, promising to make gay Christians straight if they prayed hard enough. At first promoting ex-gay terminology, reparative therapists later developed the language of same-sex attraction as part of their sexual conversion process. If a person failed to become straight, they were shamed for resisting the work of the Holy Spirit. Then while churches continued to hold gay people to a traditional sexual ethic, they abandoned historical biblical teachings about procreation, celibacy, divorce, and remarriage for straight people.






Sexual orientation change efforts 96% ineffective at reducing SSAs

But SOCEs increased risk of suicide by 92%

54% of LGBT+ people have left the faith (top reason: ex-gay programs)
Ex-gay Results

[Notes]
Studies have consistently shown that despite intense effort, a person's attractions are unlikely to change. Limited but high-quality research demonstrates that only 3-4% of people who participated in sexual orientation change efforts experienced any change in their same-sex attractions, and even these results were from self-reports that cannot be verified. (that’s 96% ineffective)  Moreover, scientific studies have demonstrated that sexual orientation changes efforts increase the risk of suicide attempts by an alarming 92%.

Other results of these practices are more substantial. In the most extensive study of LGBT+ people and the Church, Andrew Marin’s Us Versus Us reveals that of the 22.4 million LGBT+ people in the US, 19.3 million (86%) grew up in church. Perhaps surprisingly, LGBT+ people are actually more likely than the average American to grow up in a religious family. Of those, 10.4 million LGBT+ people have left the faith—that’s 54% of LGBT+ people who grew up in the Church—and their top reasons for leaving included negative personal experiences such as ex-gay programs.






Older generations burden by false promise of orientation change and SSA directly tied to ex-gay movement

For younger generations, SSA carries same baggage at worst and out of touch at best
SSA + next gen

[Notes]
Many generations of gay people have been burdened by the Church with a false promise of change using the language same-sex attraction. If older generations of gay people hear a Christian using the phrase same-sex attraction, they assume that the Christian seeks to offer these same destructive ex-gay practices and are hindered from seeing or experiencing the love of God.
For some, same-sex attraction carried baggage that contradicts the love of Jesus. For younger generations, this phrase carries the same baggage at worst or is out of touch at best.

Gay teens are 5 times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers. LGBT+ youth who say religion is important to them are 38% more likely to be suicidal than their non-religious LGBT+ peers, suggesting that homophobic religious beliefs increase teens’ vulnerability to depression. This is staggering, particularly when we notice that religiosity reduces suicidality for every other demographic in the United States except for LGBT+ people. Gay teens who come from highly rejecting families are 8.4 times more likely to attempt suicide than other gay teens.

Eliminate the closet by making sure every 8-year-old know God’s love+wisdom for gay people and that parents are safe (in part by using common language)
Eliminate the Closet

[Notes]
We cannot undo the harm to gay people in the past, but we can respond to the risk posed to gay teens today by using language that is most likely to reach the kids in our church pews.

In particular, we want to eliminate the 5-year gap between when the average teen realizes they are gay versus when they share with a parent or pastor, making sense of their sexuality without the love or wisdom of their parents or church. Instead, we want kids to share with their parents as soon as they recognize their same-sex attractions because they have heard their parents and pastors share God’s love and wisdom for gay people and demonstrate safety, in part, by using the terminology they are familiar with.







Teens will hear society use gay to describe their experience

If you use SSA and forbid gay, set up a false dichotomy between authenticity and faith

Making teens to use words peers don’t instead of common neutral language is less effective
Words teens use

[Notes]
For these reasons, I use the word gay. Regardless of how sheltered teens, families, and young adults I serve have been, they will hear their peers and the media use modern terms about sexuality to describe people who experience same-sex attraction. If I exclusively use same-sex attraction and forbid teens from using the language of their peers, I risk setting up a false dichotomy that they can either admit that they are gay or be a Christian. If I force gay teens to use terms that no one in their generation uses, instead of using language that is definitionally neutral, I will be less effective.






“To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law…I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.”

Paul followed cultural customs and language to be effective
Like a Jew, to win

[Notes]
This attention to strategy is not foreign to the Christian or the Anglican. In 1 Corinthians 9:20-22 Paul says the following:
20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. 21 To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those not having the law. 22 To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.
While Paul no longer lived according to Jewish Law, when he hoped to most effectively reach Jews, he became like a Jew. He followed their customs and used their language. In the same way, I mirror the language of gay teens and young adults so that I can most effectively reach them.

The 24th Article of the 39 Articles of Religion establishing the Anglican Church says this:
Of Speaking in the Congregation in such a Tongue as the people understandeth. It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the Primitive Church to have public Prayer in the Church, or to minister the Sacraments, in a tongue not understanded of the people.
A core principle of the Anglican Church has been to contextualize the gospel for each culture, instead of letting language and culture be a barrier to Christ’s love. We have committed to using terminology that will be readily understood by our audience. For gay teens, this will be the term gay Christian.

Held gay people to high sexual ethic
Abandoned biblical teaching on procreation, celibacy, divorce, and remarriage
Perpetuated destructive SOCEs leading to loss of faith and life
Selectively lifted up voices of gay celibacy Christians to further agenda
Luke 11-style leaders

[Notes]
Like the hypocrisy of Pharisees in Luke 11, Christians have inconsistently applied God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship. Churches have held gay people to a traditional sexual ethic while abandoning historical biblical teachings about procreation, celibacy, divorce, and remarriage for straight people. Simultaneously, Christians have perpetrated destructive sexual orientation change efforts in their own churches, leading to 54% of gay Christians losing their faith. Even today, Christian leaders follow the example of the Pharisees of Luke 11 by selectively lifting up the voices of gay celibate Christians when it furthers their agenda, but they refuse to condemn the reparative therapy and conversion therapy practiced in our churches.






Despite, some continue to follow traditional sexual ethic but struggled to thrive because
lack of clear + compassionate teaching
gay teens forced to make sense of sexuality alone
pastoral care outsourced to therapists + parachurch ministries
no lifelong + lived-in family for celibacy
Luke 11-style inaction

[Notes]
Despite these challenges, some gay Christians have continued to steward our sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic. Yet we have struggled to thrive in our churches where this discriminatory application of a traditional sexual ethic continues, where pastors fail to teach clearly and compassionately about God’s love and wisdom for gay people, where silence forces gay teens to make sense of their sexuality alone, where pastoral care is outsourced to therapists and parachurch ministries, and where celibate people fail to experience permanent, lived-in family—regardless of sexual orientation. Like the Pharisees of Luke 11, Christian leaders fail to take practical steps to alleviate these heavy burdens.

Instead, religious elites heap on the burden of additional language policing. I have been given complex and inconsistent rules for what terminology I can use to describe myself. I have been cautioned against fellowshiping with other gay celibate Christians. I have been discouraged from sharing my full testimony.

Will heavy burdens make it hard for gay people to believe God exists & loves them? Will Christian leaders respond with Luke 11-style “waiting to catch him in something he might say”?

I pray leaders would recognize biblical orthodoxy of this strategy & trust local discernment in churches
Fears + a Prayer

[Notes]
I fear these heavy burdens will make it difficult for other gay Anglicans to believe that God exists and loves them because of their painful experience of the Body of Christ. I fear that gay people outside of conservative churches will see how gay celibate Christians like me are treated, and wonder, “If that’s how they treat the celibate ones, then I’m certainly not welcome,” hindering them from knowing God.
Finally, I suspect that this document will be met with a similar reaction to Christ’s words in Luke 11. While I dare not compare myself to Jesus, I fear that this document will similarly fail to convict and reform. Instead, I expect to be more fiercely questioned. Like the Pharisees, I expect Chrisitan leaders to pick apart every word, “waiting to catch him in something he might say.”
