Why we’re here
We can’t just believe the right things. We must also correctly embody them.

What are the differences between Side A vs. Side B vs. Side X both theologically and practically?




[Notes]
Your pre-work included a description of three different theological camps and what it looks like to embody a Side B theology well
I think it’s important to make sure we are on the same page about the differences between these three theologies, and why it is so important that we not only believe the right things but also correctly embody them
here’s a brief overview of the theological differences (stuff from blog post)



Side A



God makes people gay
God blesses same-sex marriages in the same ways that He blesses opposite-sex marriages
Requires theological maneuvering or a belief that the Bible is not binding/prescriptive for a modern context 



Side B



Same-sex attraction is a result of the Fall
We do not choose who we are attracted to and there is no formula for changing one’s attractions
Same-sex romantic and sexual activity are sins
All people are called to celibacy or marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Christians can identify as gay in limited ways




Side X



Same-sex attracted Christians must reject their attractions and work toward change
Continuing to experience SSA is a sign of willful disobedience
Homosexuality is sinful
God intends for all people to marry someone of the opposite sex



Why we’re here
How we embody what we believe matters just as much, if not more than, what we believe.




[Notes]
but its just important to recognize the practical differences

Side A churches believe that God desires for all of us to enjoy romantic companionship with people we are sexually attracted to. Side A churches often only use the Bible in limited ways—when it aligns with a humanist ethic that they believe God has revealed to mankind through reason. These churches do not talk about celibacy or support it in any meaningful ways, and why would they? God has offered marriage as the solution to loneliness and you can marry whomever you want.

Side B churches talk about sexuality and the brokenness of everyone’s sexuality from a young age. These churches recognize that while some people will develop same-sex attraction, they are still loved by God and have a beautiful role in His story. These churches are places that talk in theologically accurate ways about celibacy and marriage, and both celibacy and mixed-orientation marriages are normalized, supported, and modeled in the church.

The Side X church makes clear that God is against homosexuality, but says little more. If a gay teen comes out to his or her parents, the child is connected with therapists and parachurch ministries to help the child become straight. These churches do not talk about celibacy or support it in any meaningful ways, because marriage with someone of the opposite sex is God’s answer to loneliness.

it’s clear: it’s not enough to believe the right things
we must embody them

and that’s why we’re here today



Why we’re here
We’ve seen bad fruit of Side X.

We must either move to Side A (change our theology) or Side B (change how we embody our beliefs).

Otter Creek has chosen Side B.





[Notes]
like many churches, you have shared a traditional sexual ethic in one way or another, and you’ve seen bad fruit of that
we must reckon with that
either our theology if wrong, or the way we are embodying it is wrong
that requires us to either change our theology or significantly change how we embody a traditional sexual ethic

Otter Creek’s shepherds seem to have chosen to maintain Side B beliefs while changing the ways this church embodies those beliefs—so that it will produce good fruit in the lives of gay people
as we will see, this will require huge structural change
but its worth it
because if OC does what it takes, it can become a place where
All children grow up hearing their parents and ministers talk about how God created us for deep relationship and to enjoy that in the context of family
We hear and see that modeled in marriages and by celibate people living in community
Both seem beautiful and we eagerly await to ask God which he has for us
They also hear their parents and ministers talk compassionately about the brokenness of all of our sexualities, including experiencing same-sex attraction, for sure
They see gay people out in their church, deeply connected in community, stewarding their sexualities in celibacy or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex, and thriving
When some of those boys and girls get to late elementary school or early middle school
And they realize they are gay
They share with parents and ministers early
They know God loves them and has good things for them
And they know their parents and ministers will respond well
So early on, teens walk with their parents and ministers asking, “What does God think about my sexuality and how has He invited me to steward that?”
They share openly with their peers, and they find deep friendship
And just like their peers, they are asking God whether he has celibacy or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex for them
All the while, their relationships with God deepens
In their 20s, some of these gay young adults feel called to Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex, like many of their straight peers
They step into that, honest about their sexuality but also confident in God’s design for Christian marriage
While marriage is never easy, they grow in desire for their spouse, navigating challenges together and in community, leading to a growing family
At the same time, other gay young adults feel called to celibacy, like many of their straight peers
Together with their straight celibate Christian friends, these gay celibate Christians step into committing to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
They live in community with each other and discern how God has called them to use their singleness for the Church
They experience family with those they live with and they have many spiritual children
All the while, straight Christians are encouraged and challenged by the witness of their gay brothers and sisters
And both gay and straight non-Christians are dumbfounded by the joy and beauty of the lives of gay Christians who have committed to honoring God with their sexualities

Discussion




[Notes]
so how are we going to do that today
I’ve been asked to take the shepherd’s consensus, what I know about Otter Creek, and my expertise in this area to offer you a proposal for a vision for Otter Creek—what your shepherds and ministers want compassionate and effective ministry around these topics to look like 10 years from now—and a strategy for how to realize that vision—a set of action steps to be taken over the coming years to make that compassionate and effective ministry a reality

I’m going to do that by going through the consensus points and offering the needs and questions they each highlight. Then in response to those needs and questions, I’m going to offer a vision for how Otter Creek could address those needs/questions excellently. And then I will describe what steps might need to be taken to realize that piece of the vision.

We’ll cover all of the consensus points in five chunks, and after each chunk, I’m going to invite you to ask questions to clarify my proposal and offer early feedback.



How we’ll do it
THIS PROCESS
Session 1 (Today)
Review Proposed Vision + Action
Session 2: Finalize Vision + Action




[Notes]
Then after today, I’m going to send my proposal and early feedback to this group, and you’re going to meet without me to review the proposal, highlight areas of consensus, highlight areas of disagreement, and make suggestions for how to move forward.

You’ll send all of that back to me, and then during our second session all together, I’ll lead us in solidifying a vision and strategy that best fits Otter Creek and what to do next

A quick note about the focus of this process: While transgender people are often lumped in with sexual minorities and Christians needs to think carefully about how to love transgender people well, casting vision and thinking strategically about how to minister to transgender people as a church address a whole different set of cultural questions and theological principles. It really requires its own space to do that well. I encourage Otter Creek to make space for that, and EQUIP has content to help you navigate that. But the focus of this process will be on how we teach about and minister to sexual minorities. That being said, a lot of what we talk about in this process will be transferable.

Vision 1
Otter Creek is a place where all Christians are invited to think theologically about their sexual stewardship. All Christians submit their sexuality to God and are stewarding their sexualities in culturally inconvenient ways. All Christians have a healthy theology of both marriage and celibacy. All Christians seek God’s preference for whether they commit to marriage or celibacy. All Christians are held accountable to stewarding their sexualities in God-honoring ways.




[Notes]
In order to address those questions, and to respond to the needs they highlight, here’s a vision of Otter Creek addressing those well

VISION 1

Otter Creek is a place where all Christians are invited to think theologically about their sexual stewardship. All Christians submit their sexuality to God and are stewarding their sexualities in culturally inconvenient ways. All Christians have a healthy theology of both marriage and celibacy. All Christians seek God’s preference for whether they commit to marriage or celibacy. All Christians are held accountable to stewarding their sexualities in God-honoring ways.

Let me tease out particularly the more difficult parts of that a little further
recognize that God know’s best for us and find the courage to lead the church in discovering how God thinks about these topics
If we’re going to call gay people to either celibacy or a mixed-orientation marriage
Then we’ve got to call straight people to marriage for the right reasons
We’ve got to provide church discipline around divorce and remarriage for straight people
Most churches today lead straight Christians to assume that they will get married, teach that we need romantic companionship to be happy, and ignore the Bible’s teachings about lifetime celibacy and divorce. This leads to high divorce rates and a void of theology and practice of lifetime abstinent singleness among straight Christians.
You can’t refuse a gay person lead worship or student ministry, but then allow someone to do those things who is in their second marriage but still married to their first spouse in the eyes of God
And, if we really think celibacy is a good option for gay people, we must be inviting every straight person to consider it
A church will not be a place where gay people can thrive in celibacy until a meaningful number of straight people accept their call to lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom



Action 1



Shepherds and Ministers will have to answer those questions that I posed earlier. How do we believe God answers those questions?

Parents and Children’s Ministers are trained to think theologically about sexual stewardship for all people and talk about both celibacy and marriage as beautiful possibilities for their children.

[Notes]
So what must Otter Creek do to become that place? To realize that vision?

ACTION

First, shepherds and ministers will have to answer those questions that I posed earlier. How do you believe God answers those questions?

Refusing to find answers to these questions and lead your congregation is a refusal to lead. These are not secondary questions. God created us in His image for relationship. Being people in relationship is central to what we were created for. The wisdom that guides how we do that is too important to leave Christians alone with Satan to be led away to destruction.

After you’ve found consensus on those questions, you’ve got to teach those things and help people live them out.

Parents and children's ministers are trained to think theologically about sexual stewardship for all people and talk about both celibacy and marriage as beautiful possibilities for their children.



Action 1



Youth Ministers and parents teach teens about God's design for celibacy and marriage, how to do each well, and how to respond to the different ways that our needs for relationship are broken. Youth Ministers and parents invite teens to begin asking God what His preference is for their relational vocation.

[Notes]
Teens and beyond see both celibacy and marriage as beautiful options and open-handedly offer the question to God. When individuals feel confidence about their calling, they step into that calling eagerly.

What are the results of this?
A meaningful number of straight Christians accept their call to lifetime singleness. Christians called to celibacy model thriving in that for younger generations. The callings and ministries of celibate people are celebrated. Celibate Christians are integrated in nuclear families or supported in starting intentional Christian communities with other celibate people.

All of this leads to healthier marriages, God-honoring practice of celibacy, and a broader experience of family in the Body of Christ.

Otter Creek is a place where every member knows how to speak in compassionate and theologically accurate ways about what God has to offer LGBT+ people and how that is good. As a result, gay members who are still in the closet hear their church speak well about this and are motivated to share their stories with their church.




[Notes]
In order to address those questions, and to respond to the needs they highlight, here’s a vision of Otter Creek addressing those well

VISION

Otter Creek is a place where every member knows how to speak in compassionate and theologically accurate ways about what God has to offer LGBT+ people and how that is good. As a result, gay members who are still in the closet hear their church speak well about this and are motivated to share their stories with their church.

Why is this important? 
If we don’t prepare the average member to think compassionately and theologically about these questions, how are they likely to respond in conversations where they could reflect Christ’s love?
Currently, most Christians avoid conversations about these topics because they think they are losing conversations for the gospel
Or we speak poorly pushing people away
Even for straight people, how a church talks about these topics is one of the main reasons non-Christians hesitate to give Jesus a chance
Plus, the theologies straight people in our churches hold affects the gay people in our churches
If you hold Side X beliefs, you will push gay people toward loneliness, depression, and suicidality
If you hold Side A beliefs, you normalize a theology that is destructive for gay people
most of the straight people I know who have Side A beliefs believe there’s a convincing way to read the Bible that supports same-sex marriages
but they don’t think very deeply about that
they don’t question how what they do with Scripture to make it support same-sex marriages might affect the way they think about all of Scripture
all the while, they make Side A seem like a normal and safe option
so gay Christians move from Side B to A
But because this is so central to their life, they can’t adopt a way to read Scripture that allows them to read it as pro-gay marriage without reading all of Scripture through that lens
After a couple of years, most of my gay Christians friends who went Side A came to believe that the Bible wasn’t binding or authoritative for a modern context
but if the Bible can’t tell you who God or Jesus is
you come to realize that the God you are worshipping is just the God of your imagination
what’s the likelihood that the God of your imagination is just that: imaginary?
unfortunately, most of my gay Christian friends that go Side A aren’t Christians anymore
I don’t wish that upon them
I want them to have deep relationships with God
but the fruit of gay Christians adopting Side A has been losing their faiths
that’s why it matters what straight Christians think about this
because they can have Side A beliefs without losing their faiths
but gay people can't

On top of that, if gay members in the closet don’t hear their congregation talk about this in compassionate and theologically accurate ways, they will assume it’s unsafe
they will not share
they will make sense of this alone
and that has horrible consequences



Action 2



Shepherds and Ministers will need to answer these questions.

In order to address those questions, and to respond to the needs they highlight, here’s a vision of Otter Creek addressing those well

VISION:

Otter Creek is a place where ministers and lay leaders can provide good one-on-one pastoral care to gay people.

Why is this important? 
Historically, ministers and lay leaders haven’t sought out the expertise to provide effective pastoral care
instead, they send gay people to therapists or external ministries
The shame and loneliness of gay teens is amplified because their challenges are treated as weird problems that need special treatment. They are told to make sense of a key aspect of their personhood away from the church family they worship with, pray with, and take communion with.

Plus, on the question of accountability and church discipline, I understand the desire to take things on a case-by-case basis, but the result of that is often discrimination
You need to have clear rules about different depth of involvement at OC and to what extent people at that level of involvement are submitting to the accountability of the church



Action 3



Select Ministers, Shepherds, and other lay leaders commit to seeking out training to gain expertise in providing pastoral care around these topics.

When individuals feel confidence about their calling, they step into that calling eagerly.

Why is this important?
This is the key to bearing good fruit of a traditional sexual ethic
We are created for intimacy in the context of family
If gay people can’t find that in celibacy or a mixed-orientation marriage, there will be bad fruit
And gay teens will have nothing to hope for
You can’t be a church where no one is thriving in celibacy or the complexities of marriage with someone of the opposite sex
Because if you are, you are essentially walking gay teens to a desert, giving them a shovel and a bag of seeds, and then commanding them to thrive.

How will we minister to teens who believe differently than Otter Creek and are seeking romantic relationships with people of the same sex?




[Notes]
And they raise a lot of questions:
How will we communicate God’s design for Christian marriage and vocational celibacy to children and teens?
How will we educate parents to teach their children?
How will we minister to teens who believe differently than Otter Creek and are seeking romantic relationships with people of the same sex?



Needs + Questions
How will we invite all teens, including gay teens, to discern whether God is calling them to celibacy or Christian marriage?
How will we lead gay teens to think in theologically accurate ways about  sexuality?
How will we ensure that gay teens at Otter Creek are hopeful about their future prospects?

Vision 5
Otter Creek talks about the possibility of same-sex attraction across the lifespan in age-appropriate ways. Before a teen realizes he or she is gay, the teen hears that gay people don’t choose who they are attracted to, that they have nothing to be ashamed about, that we won’t try to fix them, that we don’t love them any less, and that God has good and beautiful plans for them. Then, when teens realize they are gay, they quickly share with their parents and ministers, inviting them to help them learn how to steward their sexuality in God-honoring ways.





[Notes]
In order to address those questions, and to respond to the needs they highlight, here’s a vision of Otter Creek addressing those well

VISION

Otter Creek talks about the possibility of same-sex attraction across the life-span in age-appropriate ways. Before a teen realizes he or she is gay, the teen hears that gay people don’t choose who they are attracted to, that they have nothing to be ashamed about, that we won’t try to fix them, that we don’t love them any less, and that God has good and beautiful plans for them. Then, when teens realize they are gay, they quickly share with their parents and pastors, inviting them to help them learn how to steward their sexuality in God-honoring ways.

Why is this so important
Most churches wait until a kid shares that he is gay to address the topic of homosexuality.
This is a problem.
On average, teens wait five years after first recognizing their same-sex attraction to talk to a parent or pastor.
That’s five years that a teen makes sense of these questions alone.
Most often, this means that a teen has either developed shame, depression, and suicidality or adopted a progressive sexual ethic (and often both).



Action 5



Ministers train parents of young children to think carefully about same-sex attraction among Christians and speak carefully about the topic with and around their children. Children’s Ministers are trained to think carefully about same-sex attraction among Christians and respond carefully when the topic comes up at church.

ACTION

ministers train parents of young children to think carefully about same-sex attraction among Christians and speak carefully about the topic with and around their children. Children's ministers are trained to think carefully about same-sex attraction among Christians and respond carefully when the topic comes up at church.



Action 5



Youth Ministers are trained to think carefully about same-sex attraction among Christians and teach parents and teens to think carefully. Before a gay teen recognizes his or her attractions, the teen hears from parents and ministers what God invites LGBT+ people into and how that is good for LGBT+ people.

Before a SSA teen recognizes his or her attractions, the teen hears from parents and ministers what God invites LGBT+ people into and how that is good for LGBT+ people.



Action 5



We communicate to teens that there are God-honoring and rich ways to walk out same-sex attraction. This is shared in such a way that students will believe and embrace it.

Action 5



When a teen recognizes his or her attraction, the teen shares with parents early and parents respond effectively. Parents know that ministers are available to walk with families of gay teens, and parents invite ministers into this work early. Ministers provide effective support. All of this leads to gay teens stewarding their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic, enjoying a deep relationship with God, and thriving in this life.

QUESTION: What questions do you have? How can I provide clarity about the need, vision, and action steps? What is your initial feedback?



SIDE A & X


[Notes]
Lastly, I want to carefully address the question of how ministers who cannot in good conscience teach Side B might navigate the differences, whether they lean more toward Side A or Side X



Side A & X
Teaching Side B Publicly
Allow another Minister or Shepherd to teach
Introduce and support that teacher
In no way undermine the teacher or consensus





[Notes]
In spaces where ministers need to teach Side B theology and translate it practically for their audience, ministers who feel like they cannot in good conscience teach that theology can choose not to teach. Instead, they can invite another minister or shepherd to deliver that teaching. The reluctant minister will introduce the minister or shepherd who will teach, communicating his/her support for that teaching minister/shepherd and encouraging the audience to listen and actively engage. The reluctant minister will in no way undermine the credibility of the teaching minister/shepherd to the theology he/she will teach.



Side A & X
Responding to Questions Publicly
Sidestep
Communicate support for the teacher and respect for the consensus





[Notes]
If a reluctant minister is asked in public what he/she believes on these topics, the individual will side-step the question, answering that he/she supports the teaching minister/shepherd and respects the shepherds' consensus for how God has invited all of us to steward our sexualities.



Side A & X
Responding to Questions Privately
Refrain from sharing personal beliefs
Attend to immediate safety concerns and reassure of God’s love
Ask to pass the teen on to the teaching Minister/Shepherd





[Notes]
If a reluctant minister is asked privately about his/her beliefs, for example, when a teen is sharing that he/she is gay, the reluctant minister will refrain from sharing his/her different beliefs. The reluctant minister will attend to any immediate safety concerns and reassure the teen that God’s love for the Christian teen does not change, regardless of what we believe or what decisions we make. The reluctant minister will ask the teen if he/she would be willing to continue conversation with the minister or shepherd who taught teens about sexual stewardship. If the teen consents, the reluctant minister will pass discipleship of this teen around sexuality to the teaching minister/shepherd.

NEXT


[Notes]
So what’s next?



Next Steps
Review this Proposal without me, identifying elements that align with the consensus, elements that contradict the consensus, and elements where more clarity is needed from Shepherds.




[Notes]
As I mentioned earlier your next step it to take this proposal and meeting without me sometime in the next couple weeks
I will send you specific instructions over email
But what I want you to do is go through each of these 6 pieces (5 vision pieces and proposal for navigating differences)
And discuss what aspects you confidently feel fit the consensus, what aspects you feel confident don’t fit, and where you might need more clarity from shepherds
When it comes to the 5 vision pieces, in particular, I’d love for you to spend time on the 
Questions, Vision, and Action
For the Questions, answer those questions the best you can based on your understanding of the consensus
Where clarity is needed from shepherds, note that
For the Vision, suggest edits and areas where clarity is needed
For the Action Items, suggest edits, areas where clarity is needed, missing steps, etc.

You’ll send all of that back to me, and then during our second session all together, I’ll lead us in solidifying a vision and strategy that best fits Otter Creek and what to do next
