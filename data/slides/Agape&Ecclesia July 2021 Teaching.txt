Stewardship for All



How has God created us for intimacy in the context of family?
What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?
What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?
What is Christian marriage, and why does God’s wisdom matter?

[Notes]
How has God invited all Christians to steward their sexuality?

I also want to note how I think this content will be helpful:
First, it will deepen your understanding and confidence
Second, it will model nuanced conversation with students
With the hopes that THIRD, deeper understanding will inform actions you take as staff individually and collectively
And Fourth, that continued rumination on this content after this training will equip you to apply these concepts in conversation with a diversity of students




INTIMACY & FAMILY


[Notes]
first we’re going to start with the foundation
How has God created each of us for intimacy in the context of family, regardless of sexual orientation?

Why start here?
When we attempt to talk to teens and young adults about sex, dating, intimacy, and family, we typically focus on urging them to refrain from sexual activity. 
But by focusing only on dating, sex, and marriage when we try to communicate a biblical sexual ethic, we admit that the best things in life are sex and marriage. To those who will never marry or have sex (for whatever reason), we mislead them into believing that their calling is lesser. And to those who will marry, and have sex, we set false expectations that marriage and sex will end loneliness and fulfill them completely. Plus, a focus on dating, marriage, and sex communicates to gay people that if they obey God’s teachings, they are likely to miss out on the best things that God has to offer. 

When we focus only on sex and marriage, the Church suffers, too: very few people submit to the calling of singleness in order to serve God with undivided attention, more Christians fall into pornography usage (somewhere around 10% of Christian women and 64% of Christian men view pornography at least monthly https://www.provenmen.org/pornography-survey-statistics-2014/), divorce rates soar when the fulfillment we were promised doesn’t come (among those who attend church regularly, about 38% have been divorced https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/factchecker-divorce-rate-among-christians/#_ftn1), and 54% of gay people who grow up in the Church end up leaving the faith (Us versus Us by Andrew Marin). We must offer something better.

We need to zoom out to include more of the possibilities God has for us and frame the conversation around the right questions: How has God created all of us for intimacy with God and other humans? What are the best ways for every person to enjoy human intimacy in the context of family? How are all of us called to submit to God our capacities for romance and sex? How can all of us enjoy deep relationship in committed community, regardless of whether we’re called to committed singleness or Christian marriage? To answer those questions, to figure out what we’re made for, maybe we should start by looking at our Creator. At God.





Intimacy & Family



God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.

God is a being who enjoys intimacy in the context of family, and He created us in His image for those same things.

[Notes]
God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.

How do we know that? Because God is a being who enjoys intimacy in the context of family, and He created us in His image for those same things.
 
God put Himself in families. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit make up a family called the Trinity. And the Trinity created this world, made man, gave us choice, and sent His son to live a perfect life and die on the cross for our sins so that we could be a part of His family. The Bible goes even further to establish that God is in family and He invites us into that family by calling us, the group of people who follow Jesus, Christ’s bride and calling Jesus our groom. We’re being married into the family of God.  

(SKIP) In John 3:29, John the Baptist meets Jesus for the first time and describes himself as a guest at a wedding where Jesus is the groom and the people of God are his bride. In Ephesians 5 Paul uses an analogy of a husband and wife to teach Christ-followers to submit to God and to celebrate that we are Christ’s bride. Finally, in Revelation 19:6-9, the Apostle John describes a wedding feast at the end of time when Christ returns triumphantly to celebrate being united with his bride, the Church—that’s us!



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)

[Notes]
But God isn’t just a being in a family. The love enjoyed in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church is a particular kind of love. Historically, Christians have characterized that love in six ways: God’s love is complementary, intimate, procreative, faithful, sacrificial, and hospitable:

First, God’s love is complementary or diverse. There is a different-ness between the persons of the Trinity—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. And there is complementarity between Christ and his bride, the Church.






Intimacy & Family



“After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne…” (Revelations 7:9)

[Notes]
(SKIP) In Revelations 7:9, the Apostle John describes a celebration of the diversity of God’s people: “After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne…”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)

[Notes]
Second, God’s love is intimate. The persons of the Trinity know each other perfectly and are fully known by each other.




Intimacy & Family



“‘My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they...be one as we are one—I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.’” (John 17:20)

[Notes]
(SKIP) In John 17:20, Jesus speaks longingly about the Trinity when praying for his disciples: “‘My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they...be one as we are one—I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.’
 




Intimacy & Family



“...At that moment heaven was opened, and [Jesus] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’” (Matthew 3:16-17)

[Notes]
God the Father reciprocates this affection. Just after Jesus is baptized, the following happens in Matthew 3:16-17” “...At that moment heaven was opened, and [Jesus] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.’”



Intimacy & Family



“Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. We love because he first loved us.” (1 John 4: 7, 8, and 19)

[Notes]
Plus, Christ intimately knows and loves His people and wants them to seek out relationship with Him.

(SKIP)  1 John 4: 7, 8, and 19 say, “Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. We love because he first loved us.” We can only love because God Himself is love, made us to be creatures who love, and loved us first.




Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)

[Notes]
Third, God’s love is procreative or life-giving. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit made the world, filled it with animals, and made us humans, together. The Trinity gave us life. And then God became man and Jesus lived and died for us so that we could have life.

In John 10:10 Jesus says, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” Without Jesus we are dead people walking. We have sinned against God, and we do not deserve to join Him in heaven. But Jesus paid the price for our sins so that we could have eternal life.
 
Fourth, the love of God is faithful or permanent. There is a perfect and permanent faithfulness in the Trinity and from Christ to His people. No matter what we do, God will never abandon us or withhold his love.




Intimacy & Family



“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is [God’s] faithfulness.” (Lamentations 3:22-23)

[Notes]
(SKIP) Lamentations 3:22-23 says it this way: “The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is [God’s] faithfulness.”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)

[Notes]
Fifth, the love of God is sacrificial. As we’ve already mentioned, Jesus offered himself up as a perfect sacrifice so that all of God’s children could return to Him. 




Intimacy & Family



“You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly... But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:6 and 8)

[Notes]
(SKIP) Paul describes Christ’s sacrifice in this way in Romans 5:6 and 8: “You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly... But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”



Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)
Hospitable (Luke 14, Leviticus 19)

[Notes]
And finally, the love of God is hospitable. Ultimately, the work of creating this world and humans to fill it was an invitation into God’s family. And then God extended His arms of invitation again by dying on the cross so we could be reunited with Him.



Intimacy & Family



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

[Notes]
Okay, but what does the fact that God is in family and enjoy love in that family characterized by those 6 things have to do with us, humans?

Well, because we are created in God’s image, we are made for that kind of love with God and each other
We were made for image-bearing intimacy.





Intimacy & Family



“‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.” (Genesis 1:26-27)

[Notes]
“‘Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.’ So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.”
That’s what God said in Genesis 1:26-27 when He created the first humans. We are made in His image. We are imitations, designed to be like God. That’s a big deal, and there’s so much we can learn from that. If we were designed to imitate God, then the nature of God can teach us about ourselves. If we’re unsure what we were made for—what we need—one way to figure that out is by looking at what God values, how He relates to the people around Him. So if God enjoys intimacy in the context of family, maybe we are made for those same things, because we are made in His image.





Intimacy & Family



We are created in God’s image for that kind of love with God and each other

Sexuality – our need for relationship, to know and be known, to give and receive that kind of love

[Notes]
So God enjoys love characterized by diversity, intimacy, giving life, faithfulness, sacrifice, and hospitality.
And we’re made in his image for that same kind of love
So we’re all made for human intimacy complementary, intimate, procreative relationships that are marked by commitment, sacrifice, and hospitality

our sexuality is our need for those things
our need to be in relationship
to know and be known
to give and receive love
and because we are mind, body, and spirit, we need connection on cognitive, physical, and spiritual levels





Intimacy & Family



We are all created for intimacy in the context of family.

[Notes]
But God didn’t just enjoy intimacy
He enjoyed it in the context of family
And we’re made in His image for that too
We were made for image-bearing family.

we are all created to enjoy this within the context of family. But when I say family, I don’t just mean married people and kids. In Matthew 12:46-50, Jesus subverts our understanding of family, rejecting familial ties based solely on biology and instead establishing that Christian family is bound by the blood of Christ:




Intimacy & Family



“While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, ‘Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.’ But to the one who had told him this, Jesus replied, ‘Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?’ And pointing to his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’” (Matthew 12:46-50)

[Notes]
“While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him. Someone told him, ‘Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.’ But to the one who had told him this, Jesus replied, ‘Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?’ And pointing to his disciples, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.’”
Jesus defines Christian family as a small community of Christians who live life together and embody the gospel for each other. 



Intimacy & Family



We are all created for intimacy in the context of family.

Family – a small community of Christians who embody the gospel for each other

[Notes]
From the beginning, families made up of God’s children were intended to imitate the love within the Trinity and between God and His people: to bear the image of that love. The love found in families was intended to be intimate, faithful, sacrificial, diverse, live-giving, and hospitable, embodying God’s love in beautiful ways.

We are ALL made for that!

Intimacy & Family



We don’t need romance, sex, or marriage, and that is good news.

We have emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy needs.


[Notes]
Some caveats or limitations about this intimacy in the context of family:

We don’t need romance, sex, or marriage, and that is good news.
We don’t actually need romance or marriage or sex to meet our needs for intimacy. The Bible never promises marriage or sex to people who follow God, and nowhere does God say we need marriage or sex to be whole, happy people. Yes, we have physical and emotional needs. And yes, romance and sex are one way we can fill those, but not the only ways. Let me explain.

One way to think about our needs for connection is to imagine a set of buckets that need to be filled with water. Each of the buckets represent a kind of intimacy we need. God made us mind, body, and spirit, so we need connection on an emotional level, intellectual level, physical level, and spiritual level.



Intimacy & Family





[Notes]
When I say emotional intimacy, I mean having conversations that help you connect with gladness or fear or anger or sadness inside of you, and where you notice some of those same things in others. When I say spiritual intimacy, I mean connecting in a way that makes you feel more connected to God, by talking about spiritual things, reading Scripture together, or worshipping together. When I say physical intimacy, I mean a hug, holding hands, sitting next to each other on the couch, putting your arm around someone’s shoulder, and yes, kissing and cuddling and sex. When I say intellectual intimacy, I mean exchanging and exploring ideas with another person.
Imagine four buckets, one labeled “emotional,” the second labeled “spiritual,” the third labeled “physical,” and the fourth labeled “intellectual.” Now some would argue that there is a fifth bucket labeled “sexual.” That we all need sexual intimacy to be whole, and if we don’t get it, we will feel empty.
But I know plenty of people who have never had sex and who are full adults. They share with me that they have vibrant social lives, rich intimacy, and a satisfying experience of community. That’s been true in my own life. The healthy emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy I have experienced in friendships has been much more satisfying than the broken physical intimacy I have experienced in the past.

Plus, the Bible doesn’t teach that we need sex or marriage to be whole people. Quite the opposite. Jesus didn’t have sex. Paul was committed to celibacy. Many of the mothers and fathers of the Church have been celibate. And Jesus says that in Heaven, there won’t be any more marriage or sex.



Intimacy & Family



“At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” (Matthew 22:30)

[Notes]
In Matthew 22:30, He says this: “At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.” It doesn’t make too much sense that our Savior was celibate or that we will all be celibate in heaven if marriage and sex are necessary to be fully human.
Instead, there are four intimacy buckets. Emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual. God provides a good chunk of our spiritual intimacy. Those who are married will partially fill each of those buckets with the intimacy from their marriage. But, even if you’re married, God and your spouse alone won’t fill your intimacy needs buckets. You will still need emotional intimacy, intellectual intimacy, physical intimacy, and spiritual intimacy from friendship.



Intimacy & Family





[Notes]
And that’s good news!
That’s good news for single people. If either a call from God or circumstances lead you to a life without romance, marriage, or sex, you can still fill your buckets. You can still meet your emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual intimacy needs in healthy ways through friendship.
That’s good news for married people. Trying to squeeze all of your intimacy needs out of God and your spouse is a good recipe for divorce. But since you don’t need romance or sex to fill any of your intimacy need buckets, you can meet the rest of your intimacy needs through intimate friendship.

Why do some believe we NEED romance, sex, or marriage?

How might seeing our intimacy needs as buckets to be filled with intimacy with God, friends, and (for some) a spouse change the way we respond to our longings?

[Notes]
SL



Intimacy & Family



None of us will meet our intimacy needs fully and finally in this lifetime.

If we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, the broken parts of our soul and mind tend to reach out for destructive and unsatisfying shortcuts.


[Notes]
None of us will meet our intimacy needs fully and finally in this lifetime. Isaiah 59:2 says that our sins, our imperfection, our unwise choices have separated us from God and each other. Because this world is broken and we are broken, we can only ever connect with God and each other imperfectly. There’s this distance because of brokenness that we can never cross. Some amount of loneliness is a part of life. It is unavoidable.
 
So should we just give up and stop trying to connect in healthy ways? No! For starters, even if we can’t meet all of our needs fully and finally, we can still get a lot of what we need. We can still enjoy rich, satisfying intimacy with God and other people in this life. And second, if we don’t meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways, the broken parts of our soul and mind tend to reach out for destructive and unsatisfying shortcuts.

Have you noticed that? When you ignore your need for community and connection and try to go at it alone, you end up making unwise decisions later. Lust, objectification, masturbation, pornography, dating apps, meaningless hookups, and adultery all become more difficult to resist. If we try to meet our intimacy needs in those broken ways, we won’t fill our buckets. We just kick them over, and it makes a mess. Instead, we need to actively work to meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways. We need to be intentional about seeking out intimate friendship with others and proactively meet our needs.




Intimacy & Family



God in the Trinity and in covenants with His people:
Complementary (Matt 19, Rev 7:9, Gen 1)
Intimate (1 John 17:20, Matt 3:16-17, 1 John 4)
Procreative (Gen 1:28, John 10:10)
Faithful (Isa 54:6-8, Hos 3:1)
Sacrificial (Eph 5:23, Gal 6:2)
Hospitable (Luke 14, Leviticus 19)

[Notes]
So God has made all of us to enjoy intimacy in the context of family.
And the love we enjoy in that family should point us back to the love in God’s family, should serve as an image of God’s love, should embody the gospel by being complementary, intimate, procreative, faithful, sacrificial, and hospitable

So what does that look like practically?
And how do we do that well?

In short, God has given us two specific ways to do that, he has designed two vocations for stewarding our sexualities in ways that honor Him and point us back to Him: vocational singleness and Christian marriage
Both of these vocations embody those 6 characteristics of the love in God’s family
Both vocations are calls to intimacy in the context of human family



Intimacy & Family



Christian vocation - a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children

[Notes]
Why do I say vocation? Well, A Christian vocation is generally a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision. 

Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom work with undivided attention
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman with an openness to raising children for the kingdom

The practice of vocational singleness and Christian marriage in our churches should be so beautiful that those who do not yet know Jesus want to draw close to them and get to know the Source of that love
When non-believers step into the homes of Christian marriages or vocational singles living together as a family, the love found there should help people believe that God loves them
And they should experience God’s love through those families

That’s why it’s so important for our churches to be places where people are thriving in Christian marriage and vocational singleness—because the gospel depends on it
And that’s why we have to teach accurately about these



Sexual Stewardship



All first called to a period of temporary singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to a vocation of Christian marriage
Others called to a vocation of singleness for the kingdom

[Notes]
So, how does a Christian know which of these vocations they are called to?
What’s God’s design for each of these vocations?
How do we do them well?

Here’s a summary of how Christians have historically understood the Bible to teach about sexual stewardship
This is the big picture for what it looks like to faithfully, in God-honoring ways, steward our sexualities



Sexual Stewardship

[Notes]
Here’s a representation of those same ideas in a diagram
As we will tease out more later, vocational singleness is distinct from temporary singleness
It is best for everyone to settle down into marriage or vocational singleness, instead of continuing in temporary singleness
Marriage and vocational singleness are equally good callings, but marriage will be more common
There is no default path, one’s calling should be an open-handed question for every Christian

Remember, I’ll tease out all of these claims in the slides to come

How has God created us for intimacy in the context of family?
What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?
What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?
What is Christian marriage, and why does God’s wisdom matter?

[Notes]
Now, we’ve got that solid foundation that God has created us in His image to enjoy intimacy in the context of family
We’ve defined intimacy and family broadly
And we’ve teased that there are two best ways for Christians to walk out their sexuality: lifetime abstinent singleness for the sake of the kingdom or opposite-sex Christian marriage for the sake of raising children
But what do we do in the meantime? How do we know whether we are called to vocational singleness or Christian marriage?

That’s what’s next

What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?



TEMPORARY SINGLENESS


[Notes]
So what is temporary singleness and how do we do it well?



Temporary Singleness



A period of temporary singleness
Enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ
Called to neither lifelong vocational singleness nor marriage
Submit our sexuality to God, study the Scriptures, discern with God and others

[Notes]
What are we first called to?

We are all first called to a temporary period of abstinent singleness in which we enjoy relationship with God and the Body of Christ in non-sexual, non-romantic companionship.
We should all learn to do this well
This is a calling to neither vocational singleness nor marriage—defining our default calling in the negative is not sufficient but it is informative—we are not yet called to vocational singleness or to marriage. 
We should not assume that we are called to marriage just because we have sexual desires, want to be a parent, or find abstinent singleness to be too challenging. 
We should all submit our sexuality to God, study what the Scriptures have to say about sexual stewardship, and discern with God and spiritual mentors in our lives whether we are called to vocational singleness or marriage.

As I mentioned earlier, the Church has consistently taught that it is NOT generally God’s intention for Christians to continue in temporary for a lifetime
For the vast majority, it is better to settle down into vocational singleness or marriage
But there are always exceptions to the rule
There will be people whom God calls to leave open the possibility of vocational singleness or marriage in there 30s, 40s, 50s, or perhaps even their entire life
Our churches need to honor and support all those who are faithfully following God’s call

Okay, but why distinguish between temporary singleness and vocational singleness?
And how does one discern between vocational singleness and Christian marriage?
Those a great questions that we’re going to get to tomorrow morning
For now, just give me the benefit of the doubt that this distinction is meaningful and that there is a time-tested way for every Christian young adult to open-handedly ask God this questions

What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?
What is Christian marriage, and why does God’s wisdom matter?

[Notes]
Next, let’s focus on vocational singleness
What is it? Why does God call some people to it?



VOCATIONAL SINGLENESS







Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.

Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Let’s break down that definition of vocational singleness






“a lifetime calling…”
God calls us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness.
God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us.
God intended for vocational singleness to be committed and permanent.
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling...
It’s a calling. God eventually calls most of us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness. As we’ll talk more about tomorrow morning in our conversation about discernment, the Bible teaches that our vocation is given or called, not chosen. God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us. And sometimes, God’s preference doesn’t match our preference.  Proverbs 16:9 tells us that our hearts plan our course, but it’s God who directs our path.  And it’s our responsibility to submit to His direction.
Everyone should open-handedly offer this question of vocational singleness or Christian marriage to God, and everyone has the same inherent capacity for both vocations. 
 
But it’s not just a calling. It’s a lifetime calling.
God intends for vocational singleness to be committed and permanent.
- In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus speaks of a call beyond temporary singleness and compares vocational singleness to being a eunuch, a state which is permanent.
- We cannot imagine Jesus providing the 100-fold blessing promised in Luke 18:28-30 to someone who has only temporarily given up the prospect of marriage and children, only to later get married.
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul recognizes and praises committed singleness and teaches that it is better to keep a commitment to vocational singleness than get married.
Then in 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul reaffirms that a commitment to vocational singleness is good and to break that commitment is a sin.

PLUS EARLY CHURCH UNDERSTANDING







“a lifetime calling to singleness…”
A call to give up romance, dating, marriage, and sex
Still a call to intimacy in the context of committed family
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness...
Vocational singleness is a call to give up romance, dating, marriage, sex, and children, but that doesn’t mean that a person is called to loneliness.

In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus talks about vocational singleness as a giving up of romance, marriage, sex, and children.
And then in Luke 18:28-30, Jesus promises a 100-fold of brothers, sisters, and children now in this present time to those who give up the potential for a spouse and children for the sake of the kingdom.
In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul confirms that vocational singleness involves giving up sex, romance, marriage, and children but recognizes that those called to vocational singleness still need committed companionship.

Vocational singleness is still a call to intimacy in the context of committed family.
In Isaiah 56:3-5, the celibate is promised family, belonging, and honor equal to the married person, that they will be full and equal members of the family of God, that they will be spiritual parents in ways just as great as biological parents.
Then in 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul recognizes early families of celibate people by commending a committed community of celibate women.

Now that we know what vocational singleness is, now let’s explore why God calls some people to this lifetime vocation of singleness.






Stay with biological family
Join another nuclear family
Create families of vocationally single people
Family in Singleness

[Notes]
But how can vocational singleness find intimacy in the context of permanent, lived-in human family?
Here’s 3 ways:

First, we can encourage people to stay deeply connected to their biological family. This might look like living with a parent, a sibling, or a cousin, doing rhythms of family with those people, and committing to helping them raise the children in that household.

Or, you might help single people knit themselves into unrelated nuclear families in your church. Maybe people go out of their way to choose celibate people as godparents for their children. Or you invite single people to weekly dinner with your family. Or include them in holidays and vacations. You could even invite single people to live in your home, commit to your family, and help you raise your kids.

Or third, you can help celibate people create families of their own
Help celibate people gather together and commit to being family for each other and doing rhythms of family together.
This is perhaps the least conventional of the options suggested here, and while it might be the most beautiful, it also involved the most logistics.
Churches can help support celibate people in creating these intentional Christian communities by suggesting the idea, helping them cast vision for it, providing pastoral support while they explore the possibility, coaching them through the process, and maybe even providing financial support in the early years.
For example, a group of 5 guys and I in Nashville are discerning whether God has called us to start an intentional Christian community for men committed to vocational singleness where we would make commitments to do life together for the rest of our lives. This are the kind of solutions the Church needs

Regardless of which path they take, they need intimate, committed, and permanent family just like everyone else
You’ve noticed that each solution involves living together and commitment
We need to help celibate people find that
Because it is particularly hard for celibate people to find that
And the paths are often unconventional

“a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom”
Do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time and energy to do
Embody the gospel in unique ways
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Why does God call some to Vocational Singleness?
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom.
Jesus uses the phrase “for the sake of the kingdom” in Matthew 19:1-12 and Luke 18:28-30 to describe vocational singleness. Those called to vocational singleness live “for the sake of the kingdom” in three ways:
First, God intended for those in vocational singleness to use their availability, primarily from not raising children, to do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time, energy, or financial freedom to do. In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus invites his disciples to consider giving up the potential for spouse and children in order to live “like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom,” referring to Old Testament eunuchs who commonly worked for a king, managing and building up the king’s kingdom. In 1 Cor 7:1-40, Paul explains that vocational singleness involves giving up a spouse and children to be more concerned with the work of the Church. In 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul commends faithful members of the community of celibate women who have fully committed themselves to the Lord.

Second, Vocational singleness is for the sake of the kingdom because it embodies the gospel. Similarly to marriage, vocational singleness is an image of the love found in God’s family (the Trinity and between Christ and the Church), preaching the gospel by reflecting that love. Vocational singleness is spiritually procreative, sacrificial, committed, intimate, and hospitable, pointing those who see that image back to the original source: God’s love.






Diverse – differentness of personalities, sexes, ages
Intimate – still a call to family, fullness of God’s love in NHNE
Faithful – permanent and lifetime, consistent kingdom work
Vocational singleness is…
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
Now, let’s look at the ways singleness for the sake of the kingdom embodies those six characteristics of love found in the Trinity and between Christ and His Church.


1. Vocational singleness is diverse. The friendships enjoyed by those committed to vocational singleness reflect the diversity in God’s family. There is a differentness between the persons in each friendship. Plus, vocational singles still need healthy relationships with people of the opposite sex, parents, and children. Vocational singleness is still a call to a diversity of friendships with people of all ages and stages of life. This differentness points observers back to the complementarity in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church as well as the unity found in the body of Christ even amidst differences.

2. Vocational singleness is intimate. As already mentioned, vocational singleness is still a call to intimacy in the context of family. Jesus and Paul recognize vocational singles’ need for committed companionship and promise a 100-fold of family in this lifetime. This intimacy points observers back to the intimacy in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church. The family vocational singles enjoy testifies to the fullness of God’s love and gives every Christian hope for how we will all live in the New Heavens and New Earth.

3. Vocational singleness is faithful. The permanent, lifetime nature of a commitment to vocational singleness reflects the faithfulness of God’s love found in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church. Through this vocation, those called faithfully live out their singleness for the Lord consistently build up the kingdom in ways that point back to the faithfulness of the love in God’s family.







Life-giving – spiritually procreative and more kingdom work
Sacrificial – give up idol of romance to follow Jesus
Hospitable – offer family to lonely
Vocational singleness is…
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
4. Vocational singleness is life-giving. While those called to vocational singleness do not bear biological children, their availability for kingdom works should bear the fruit of many times more spiritual children. The vocationally single have the time and energy to share the gospel with more not-yet-believers and mentor more new Christians than parents can. Plus, those called to vocational singleness reflect the procreative nature of God’s love by building up the kingdom and bringing spiritual life to the Church.

5. Vocational singleness is sacrificial. At first glance, those called to vocational singleness have chosen to give up their right to some of our culture’s most coveted experiences: romance, dating, marriage, and sex. The sacrifice of vocational singles points observers back to the sacrificial nature of the love in God’s family.

6. Vocational singleness is hospitable. Those called to vocational singleness have the unique opportunity to offer family to those on the margins without the need to compete for belonging. This hospitality reflects the welcoming nature of the love in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church.






“a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom”
Do kingdom work that those raising children don’t have the time and energy to do
Embody the gospel in unique ways
Give every Christian hope for the New Heavens and New Earth 
Vocational Singleness

[Notes]
And Third, Vocational singleness is for the sake of the kingdom because it gives every Christian hope for the New Heavens and New Earth. In Luke 20:34-36, Jesus teaches that all will be celibate in the New Heaven and New Earth. So vocational singleness preaches the gospel in way that marriage does not by serving as a physical sign and hope for how we will all live in the NHNE. 

Contemporaries of early Christians saw marriage as a necessity to secure physical protection, wealth, and a legacy through descendants. So when Christians called to vocational singleness fulfilled the promises in Isaiah 56:3-5 and Luke 18:29 by experiencing more family, more belonging, and more honor than married people, they provided Christians with a preview of and hope for a New Heavens and New Earth where God would keep us safe, provide everything we needed, and would never forget us. 

But today, westerners seem interested in romance and marriage because they promise a way to find faithful love and escape loneliness. So modern Christian vocational singleness can uniquely testify to the fullness of God’s love by previewing a time when we don’t have to compete—to be more attractive or intelligent or funny than others—in order to be loved by others and belong in a family. Christians today should look at those in vocational singleness, see them enjoying intimate community without the need for romance, exclusivity, or competing for each others’ affection; and that preview should give every Christian hope for the fullness of God’s love in the kingdom to come.

Stewardship for All



How has God created us for intimacy in the context of family?
What is temporary singleness and how do we discern our calling?
What is vocational singleness and how can singles find family?
What is Christian marriage, and why does God’s wisdom matter?

[Notes]
So we’ve established a solid foundation that God has created us in His image to enjoy intimacy in the context of family
We’ve defined temporary singleness
We’ve described what vocational singleness is and why God calls some to vocational singleness
Now lets define the vocation of Christian marriage and wrap up with why all of this matters



CHRISTIAN
MARRIAGE




Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman with an openness to raise children for the kingdom.



Christian Marriage



Christian marriage…
Christian marriage is joined, entered into, and sustained by God in ways other marriages are not.

[Notes]
Christian marriage
Christian = joined, entered into, and sustained by God
Christian marriage is not just natural marriage as God designed at Creation
Christian marriage is natural marriage plus a gospel purpose revealed by Christ’s life, death, and resurrection
God does not join, enter into, or sustain a non-Christian marriages in the same way He does a true Christian marriages





Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment…
Matthew 5:32, Romans 7:2-3, and 1 Cor 7:10-11,39 provide no grounds for divorce

[Notes]
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment
God expects that our vows to our spouse be permanent.
In Matthew 19, Jesus calls God’s people back to lifelong monogamy, declaring that Moses allowed the Jewish people to divorce, giving them over to their broken desires, because their hearts were hardened to God and His created intention. Then, according to more modern translations, Jesus seemingly provides an exception to this high standard of permanence, but other presentations of this episode in other Gospels lack this exception, and Jesus teaches clearly in Matthew 5:32 that if you marry someone who has been divorced, you commit adultery, without any exception. Paul confirms Christ’s teachings in Romans 7:2-3 and 1 Corinthians 7:10-11, 39 that there are no biblical grounds for divorce. Scholars argue that this exception in Matthew 19 is more likely allowing for separation without remarriage or referring to dissolving a false marriage: marriages entered into under false pretenses, a marriage never consummated, or a marriage to a concubine (1 Corinthians 5:1, Acts 15:20, Acts 15:29). 

Regardless, Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment, no exceptions





Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman…
God instituted natural marriage between one man and one woman, confirmed by Jesus and Paul

[Notes]
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman
God instituted natural marriage in Genesis 2, clearly defining marriage as between one man and one woman and established sex difference as part of what makes a marriage. In Matthew 19, Jesus reaffirms God’s original intentions for monogamous, lifelong marriage between one man and one woman. In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul does the same, stating that each husband should have only one wife, and each wife have only one husband. Then in Ephesians 5, Paul teaches that the sexual difference in Christian marriage is meant to reflect to differentness in Christ’s relationship with the Church.





Christian Marriage



Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman with an openness to raise children for the kingdom.
God’s procreation mandate stands for those called to Christian marriage

[Notes]
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman with an openness to raise children for the kingdom
I want to be clear, raising children is not the only good thing enjoyed in marriage, but it is in particular what sets it apart from vocational singleness
Obviously, just like vocational singleness, it is a call to embody the gospel and enjoy healthy intimacy

But since the beginning of time, marriage was meant to be a space to raise children. In Genesis 1: 28, God commands the first marriage to “be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.” This procreation mandate is affirmed in Genesis 9 and Psalm 127. Raising children is a central purpose of Christian marriage, and God’s command for Christian marriages to raise children was never rescinded.(note, I’ve been careful to say raise children, and not necessarily have children. As a rule, a Christian marriage is a space to raise children, whether that be one’s own or as foster or adoptive parents. While infrequent, there are always exceptions to the rule.)

For those who are called to marriage, they should recognize that marriage will be one of the most difficult things they do

The idea that Christian marriage must embody the procreative and complementary natures of God’s love has been contentious. How essential are these? What are the consequences of dismissing these as essential?

Why Follow?




If a god exists, he’s the God of the Bible, and that God knows what is best for us—we’d be fools not to follow God’s wisdom

God’s wisdom will lead us to the deepest experiences of joy and purpose and true pleasure in this life
120

[Notes]
Why follow God’s wisdom about intimacy and family? God seems to have a lot of rules for how we should seek out intimacy and family. Living your life according to that wisdom seems inconvenient. Why follow God’s wisdom?

If we believe that a god exists, if we believe that god is the God of the Bible, and if we believe that God knows what is best for us—if we really believe all of those things, we would be fools not to follow God’s wisdom.
If Lebron James was your basketball coach and you ignored his advice about how to become a better basketball player, you’d be a fool!
How much better advice does God have about the ways to enjoy the most goodness and beauty and meaning in this life? Trust Him!

We have been designed, by God, for specific purposes. That matters. We shouldn’t be surprised that when we allow ourselves to live in ways we weren’t designed to, we get hurt. We shouldn’t be surprised that when we use romance, marriage, and sex contrary to God’s design, it brings pain to our lives.

If God’s wisdom is best for us, following His teachings will save us from unnecessary pain of figuring out the best paths through trial and error. Plus, God’s wisdom will lead us to the deepest experiences of joy and purpose and true pleasure in this life.

What about this narrative is challenging? How does it contrast with the narrative of sexual fulfillment offered by culture and many churches?






THE PROBLEM


[Notes]
But here’s the problem
Churches are doing this well
So where are our areas of growth?
we can’t get better until we admit we have a problem and we identify them




The Problem(s)



God gave me desires to marry and have kids because He wants me to get married.
Marriage is about companionship and mutual fulfillment.
We only have to have kids if and when we want them.
God calls a select few to vocational singleness and sustains them spiritually.
Friendship can’t provide what marriage can and shouldn’t be too close.

[Notes]
Here’s what Christians really seem to believe today



The Problem(s)



The Church isn’t doing this well:
Straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage
There is no support for vocational singleness
We live disconnected, isolated lives

[Notes]
What are the results of having those beliefs?

we don’t refrain from emotional and physically intimate relationships before marriage
we assume we will be married, that marriage will satisfy, and that marriage is about making you happy
we no longer honor “through thick and thin” or see raising children as central
straight Christians aren’t upholding the sanctity of marriage

few consider vocational singleness as a calling
Celibacy is relegated to a curse of loneliness for the sake of the gospel
there is no support for vocational singleness because no straight people aren't doing it

don’t learn to do friendship well, have loose friendships
fear of close, same-sex friendships
don’t do life as a Body of Christ



The Problem(s)



This hurts straight Christians
Children grow up hearing all people will be straight, married, and have kids
Failed marriages due to refusing a call to vocational singleness and inaccurate expectations
Vocational singles struggle with loneliness and married people raise children alone

[Notes]
important for straight people

children are hearing that all people will be straight, married, with kids
but for many than won’t be the case
many failed marriages due to refusing a call to vocational singleness
and not accurately seeing marriage as a vocation that is lifelong and difficult
marriages would endure if we communicated more accurate expectations
Celibates struggle with loneliness and married people raise children alone
those called to vocational singleness need to see vocational singleness valued/celebrated and thriving modeled
and married people need help with kids from healthy celibates



The Problem(s)



Many people and circumstances on the margins:
Divorce
Widowing
Infertility
Pornography
Masturbation
Fornication
Adultery
Abortion
Contraception
Same-sex attraction
Broken gender

[Notes]
This also hurts gay people
But same-sex attraction is just one of the ways that God’s perfect intentions for human intimacy is bent
there are lots of people and circumstances on the margins
there are lots of ways that the way we do intimacy is broken

divorce
widowing
infertility
pornography (lust, objectification, selfish, commodification)
masturbation
sex outside of marriage
adultery
abortion
contraception
same-sex attraction
broken gender

Some but not all of these are due to individual sin
But these are all communal sins that require a communal responses

So talking theologically about how God has invited us to steward our sexualities doesn’t just help us to answer the question of same-sex marriage
It can also help us respond to each of these areas of brokenness




What’s God offering?
God does not bless same-sex marriages because they fall outside of God’s design for marriage
There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses
Same-sex sexual/romantic activity is sinful
God offers LGBT+ Christians the same options as everyone else: vocational singleness or marriage





[Notes]
So what does all of this mean for gay people, theologically?
Well without even getting into debating whether the Bible has anything directly to say about same-sex sexual and romantic activity
We can already answer the question about what God wants to offer gay people
Based on God’s design for the vocations that he blesses, based on God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship for all people

Same-sex marriages do not fulfill God’s design for Christian marriage
Anymore than two opposite-sex non-Christians do
Or two opposite-sex Christians who don’t treat the marriage as lifelong or for the purposes of raising children

There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses

So, same-sex sexual and romantic activity are less than God’s best, they are sins

God offers LGBT+ Christians the same options as everyone else: vocational singleness or Christian marriage 

And then, there’s even more evidence for a traditional sexual ethic when we get to the 6 verses that talk directly about same-sex sexual activity



What do we believe?



Being gay is a result of the Fall. God did not intend for me to be gay.
Being gay is a brokenness, but it is not a sin.
God does not send people to hell merely for being gay.
Attractions, orientation, identity, and behavior are different

[Notes]
I want to close this session with how EQUIP answers the detailed questions about sexual ethics for LGBT+ people

We believe that experiencing same-sex attraction, people finding other people of the same sex physically attractive and desiring romantic relationships with them, being gay, is a result of the Fall
That when Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, their sin led to a domino effect of brokenness. Their sin bent all of the ways God had perfectly designed and ordered this world. To the extent that this world around us, the people around us, and even ourselves are not how God first imagined us.
None of us are how God intended
All of us, regardless of sexual orientation, are corrupted at a genetic level, developed imperfectly in our mother’s womb, and were born into a broken world that wounded us long before we ever gained the capacity to sin
So we don’t think that when God first imagined any of us and projected us being born into a perfect world, that God planned for us to experience same-sex attraction
But because we are born into a broken world, one of the ways some are affected by that brokenness is that they gained these attractions
 
But I want to be clear that being gay, experiencing same-sex attraction, is not a sin
It is a brokenness, a temptation to sin, but God doesn’t hold against anyone their involuntary thoughts
God does not send people to hell merely because boys are attracted to boys or girls are attracted to girls

Let me also point out at this point that there’s a big difference between attractions, orientation, identity, and behaviors
And when Christians on either extreme conflates these, it causes big problems
Same-sex attractions can be nothing more than infrequent or one-time recognition that someone of the same-sex is physically or sexually attractive
A same-sex sexual orientation is a consistent pattern of same-sex attractions
Same-sex sexual identity involves identifying as gay either by name and/or by participating in gay cultural in ways that can be small like putting a rainbow sticker on one’s car
Same-sex sexual behavior consists of romantic and sexual activity
What I want you to see is that a Christian can experience infrequent same-sex attractions but not have a same-sex sexual orientation
A Christian can have a same-sex sexual orientation, but choose not to identify as gay
A same-sex attracted Christian can identify as gay but choose not to engage in same-sex sexual activity
But the extremes in the conversation want to deny that that nuance is possible
Those on the Left argue that all of these must line up in a particular direction, or the person is practicing self-hate
And people on the Right argue that in order to faithfully refrain from gay sex, a person must also find a way to eliminate their same-sex attractions or at least pretend they don’t experience them anymore






We do not choose who we are attracted to, but we choose how we respond.
A mix of nature and nurture contribute to the development of sexual orientation.
There is no proven formula for changes a persons’ attractions.
What do we believe?

[Notes]
We also don’t believe people choose who they are attracted to, choose to be gay or straight,
But we do choose how we respond
The consensus of scientists is that people develop their sexual attractions through a mix of nature and nurture, but people do not choose who they are attracted to
There is also no formula for changing a person’s attractions: no proven combination of prayer or counseling or weekend retreats to change someone’s sexual orientation
Certainly God has the power to do whatever he wants,
but scientific studies show that 96% of people who seek sexual orientation change efforts experience no change in their sexual orientation, but they do experience a 92% increase in suicidality due to sexual orientation change efforts (nearly doubling suicide attempts)

Now at this point, many people reasonably ask: If same-sex attractions are broken, God didn’t intend for anyone to be gay, yet God allowed that brokenness to develop and rarely heals that brokenness when people ask God for healing, how is that fair?
At the core of that question is the timeless question: why do bad things happen to innocent people?
Right?
Because people don’t choose their sexual orientation, and gay people haven’t done anything to bring about their sexual orientation
They’re innocent
So why?
Well, in order for us to have real choice and true agency to choose to love God and other people, God has to let the consequences of our decisions play out
It’s the theological concept of free process
If God just swooped in and protected each of us from the consequences of the sins of others, would their choices have been real choice?
No
So if order for our love for God and each other to mean something, God chooses the greater good of allowing things to play out
How does that apply to broken sexuality?
We believe that gay people developed this brokenness because of the sins of others
Brokenness in their genes passed on through generations
Sin in the different environments they grew up in
And to protect free will, God chose not to swoop in and prevent them from developing SSAs by blocking the consequences of the decisions of others






God calls all Christians to vocational singleness or Christian marriage.
There is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses.
Same-sex sexual and romantic activity are sins in any context.
What do we believe?

[Notes]
What does the Bible have to say about all of this? Well, as we understand it, and as a majority of Christians have understood the Bible for 2,000 years, God calls all Christians to vocational singleness—to give up the prospect of romance, dating, sex, marriage, and children to do kingdom work parents don’t have the time or energy to do--or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex
there is no context for same-sex sexual or romantic activity that God blesses in Scripture
same-sex sexual and romantic activity are sins in any context

Another way to clearly communicate what we believe is to contrast it with extremes on both sides. An organization called the Gay Christian Network popularized the terms Side A, Side B, and Side X to refer to three different theological camps in this conversation



Side A



God makes people gay
God blesses same-sex marriages in the same ways that He blesses opposite-sex marriages
Requires theological maneuvering or a belief that the Bible is not binding/prescriptive for a modern context 



Side B



Same-sex attraction is a result of the Fall
We do not choose who we are attracted to and there is no formula for changing one’s attractions
Same-sex romantic and sexual activity are sins
All Christians are called to vocational singleness or Christian marriage
Christians can identify as gay in limited ways




Side X



Same-sex attracted Christians must reject their attractions and work toward change
Continuing to experience SSA is a sign of willful disobedience
Homosexuality is sinful
God intends for all people to marry someone of the opposite sex



Honestly, I wish…



But, I can’t ignore the bad fruit of a progressive sexual ethic
Less commitment and more infidelity
My gay Christians friends who adopted a progressive sexual ethic lost their faith
My own story of pain

[Notes]
Honestly, I wish I could somehow convince myself theologically that God would bless a same-sex marriage between two Christians
(and we will get into those arguments this afternoon)
But even if I could get myself there, I’ve seen bad fruit of a progressive sexual ethic in my life and the lives of others
At a 30,000 foot level, the average adult same-sex partnership lasts much shorter than the average opposite-sex partnership
And the rates of adultery and infidelity are much higher in same-sex marriages
Now we can argue whether this is the result of societal oppression, the bad fruit of not following God’s design, or both

Then, most of my gay Christian friends who adopted a progressive sexual ethic stopped believing in God
at first, they did a little bit of theological acrobats to say that maybe Scripture could be read to support same-sex marriages
but after awhile they admitted that the Bible probably says what we’ve thought it has said
so they get to a place where they don’t believe the Bible is authoritative or binding for modern people
but once they get to a place where the Bible and the Church can’t tell you who God is
they realize they are just worshipping a God they came up with
and what’s the likelihood that the God of their imagination is real?
and listen, I don’t want that for my gay friends
I want all of them to have robust relationships with God
but the fruit I see of a progressive sexual ethic is my gay friends losing their faith

but I think the bad fruit of my own experiences has been most convincing
Satan told me for years that if I just had a relationship with a man, everything would be better
I’d finally have everything I needed
And I wish I could have just trusted God that Satan’s lies were lies
but I couldn’t
I had to test them for myself
And my own experience was that romantic relationships with men were not everything I hoped they would be
they were painful
they were not good
and while I haven’t experienced everything under the Sun, so I can’t say authoritatively that I know from experience that nothing would satisfy me
one experience was just about the clearest contrast between sin and beauty that I could ask for
when I was in a particularly dark place in college, I connected romantically with another guy
and despite the fact that I was doing things that the movies told me would make me feel more connected and loved and known than anything else, I felt so alone
and then after we stopped, the reality of what we had just done rushed in
and we sat there, on the floor, leaning against the wall, shoulder to shoulder
and we started crying, both of us
mixed in with the crying we both verbalized what we were feeling
we shared how empty that felt for both of us
how lonely we felt
how messed up this world was and disconnected we felt from God
how confused we were that God would let us be this way and yet connections like we had didn’t feel right
and you know what, I didn’t feel alone anymore
I didn’t feel disconnected anymore
you see, the romantic connections that Satan promised would satisfy me failed
and then in stark contrast to that, the two of us confessing to each other and crying out to God satisfied us and felt more beautifully intimate than anything we shared before

So no, even if I could convince myself logically of a progressive sexual ethic, I couldn’t get past all of the bad fruit I have seen



Bad fruit everywhere



Gay Christians following Biblical teaching experience bad fruit too.

The Church MUST do better.

[Notes]
But there’s bad fruit of a traditional sexual ethic
my gay Christian friends who are stewarding their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic are lonely, struggle with sin, and this effects their relationship with God and the Kingdom work they could do
And this is because the Church is doing a horrible job teaching about sexual stewardship and loving and serving people like me
I think that’s the double burden of gay Christians: the Church doesn’t know how to love us well, and the alternatives culture offers still aren’t good for us either
And that sucks
yet, that doesn’t make something bad for me good for me
that doesn’t change something from being a sin to edifying to God

why is this the way God made things?
you know, I don’t know
but at the end of the day, it’s not my job to question God or tell Him how to do His job
I’ve just got to trust that God knows what is best for me and obey His teachings

What I do know, is that Christian communities must do this better, and we’ll get to that this afternoon!

How effective would a version of this “sexual stewardship for all” be with your students?
What about its applications to LGBT+ topics?



Love & Wisdom



How can we offer all students God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship?
How can we respond pastorally to convincing cultural arguments?
How can all students discern God’s calling to singleness or marriage?

[Notes]
As a reminder, I think this content will be helpful because
First, it will deepen your understanding and confidence
Second, it will model nuanced conversation with students
With the hopes that THIRD, deeper understanding will inform actions you take as staff individually and collectively
And Fourth, that continued rumination on this content after this training will equip you to apply these concepts in conversation with a diversity of students



PASTORAL
RESPONSE

SIDE A THEOLOGY




[Notes]
you, as pastors, need to be able to make a winsome, positive case for a traditional sexual ethic
but sometimes, as pastors and leaders, you get an email or someone knocks on your door, and the conversation goes something like…
”Yeah, I understand your arguments for a traditional sexual ethic, but what about…” and they go on to list one of the convincing arguments for a progressive sexual ethic
For side a
for many gay people and straight allies, the arguments for side b are irrelevant
they’re convinced by the argument for side a
And you need to be prepared to respond well
To offer better arguments

too often I see straight pastors and leaders shy away from a full-throated defense of Side B
and if they aren’t convinced of it or are embarrassed to talk about it, they aren’t going to take any practical steps in their church
so my hope was to embolden straight pastors and parents to take action for the benefit of gay people

So today I want to explore how you can respond to the 9 most convincing arguments for a progressive sexual ethic
but as you’ll see, better arguments alone wont be enough
Many of you have probably already experience this
So we’ll conclude with some suggestions for what churches need to do in addition to making better arguments
Jesus didn’t talk about gay sex
The Bible doesn’t talk about gay marriage
The Bible was wrong about slavery and women
God makes people gay
Sexual orientation doesn’t change
Celibacy doesn’t work
Mixed-orientation marriages fail
Traditional sexual ethics bears bad fruit
A loving God wouldn’t deny me a loving marriage
9 Convincing Arguments




[Notes]
Here are the 9 most convincing arguments we’ll address

Personally, this content is born our of responding to a side a book for a close friend who was on the verge
and i had lost friends before too meak to make a strong case
this time i made a strong case
the person still went side a
but they shared with me recently that the arguments stuck with them and eroded any reasonable argument that the God of the Bible is Side A
theyve just gotten to a place where they admit they just want it to be true and theyre going to choose to believe God is that way
side b spaces often highlight the pitfalls of Side X often, but we don’t seem to remind each other enough that Side A is just as dangerous, just in different ways

Before we get started, I want to recognize the stakes of these conversations

These conversations
are high stakes

[Notes]
I want to recognize the stakes of Responding to side a arguments
Because even if we succeed in making more logical arguments
Even if we rationally defeat the arguments for side a
We can still lose the debate, by being mean, by being ugly
If we fail to be winsome, and instead we are combative and venomous and seem too eager to destroy arguments disagree with,
it won’t matter what we say
Because those we hope to convince will stop listening
It wont matter how logical we are
Because those we hope to convince will reject our reasoning because of our pathos

I’ll admit, I have been afraid to cover this topic
I am worried that I wont be winsome enough
I am worried that I will step on a landmine or two
I am worried that my tone or style will undo any progress made by my arguments

And that’s my first encouragement when it comes to responding to side a theology
If you aren’t afraid to step on landmines, that’s a problem
Because you should be
Sometimes, we are too eager to step into this conversation
Its too easy to talk about these in a way that perpetuates a culture war
So if the opportunity arises to respond to arguments for a progressive sexual ethic, first pause, and remind yourself it not enough to just be right
#1 Jesus didn’t talk
about gay sex…
It’s true,
Jesus never talked about gay sex
The “clobber passages” are unclear

But,
The “clobber passages” aren’t necessary 
Jesus had a lot to say about sexual stewardship for all




[Notes]
jesus never said anything about gay sex or gay marriage
The verses that do talk about it are all within context of incest, rape, sex outside of marriage, adultery
the Bible isn’t clear on this so should leave this to people and their God

We can admit that Jesus never spoke directly about gay sex or gay marriage
And we can recognize that the verses that seem to address gay sex, the verses many call the clobber passages, can be unclear
But as I’ll explain, they also aren’t necessary to know what God’s wisdom is for gay people, because Jesus did actually have a lot to say about our sexual stewardship

To be honest, I’d rather just skip the clobber passages altogether,
but you’ll be called on to respond to common arguments discrediting the clobber passages,
so we’ll cover them briefly, addressing arguments against them and recognizing the lack of clarity




The “clobber” passages - Genesis 19

Side A: primarily condemning gang rape or lack of hospitality

Response: gay sex wasn’t the only reason, but it was a prominent feature

Still… 
#1 Jesus didn’t talk
about gay sex…




[Notes]
Some argue that Gen 19 is really about condemning gang rape or the lack of hospitality

And, while it’s true that anyone claiming that gay sex was the sole reason for Sodom’s destruction is wrong,
same-sex sexual activity was a prominent feature of the story told, and its reasonable to conclude that it was one of the reasons Sodom was punished for

Still, this passage, in particular, has been used to justify horrific hate crimes against gay people, and referencing it is likely to unconvincing



The “clobber” passages – Lev 18 & 22

Side A: about maintaining ritual purity or condemning gay cult prostitution + author unaware of committed gay relationships

Response: can’t dismiss plain reading, God not limited by author, about ritual and moral purity
#1 Jesus didn’t talk
about gay sex…




[Notes]
Some argue that Lev 18:22 and 20:13 are about maintaining ritual purity or condemning gay cult prostitution
And they argue that these passages couldn’t possibly be condemning committed, same-sex relationships because those were nonexistent in the Ancient Near East

It’s true, gay cult prostitution was probably the most common form of same-sex sexual relations in the Ancient Near East,

But we can’t dismiss a plain reading of the text consistent with centuries of Church teaching
Plus, as we’ll address later, God is not limited by the understanding of the author, even if the author was not aware of committed, same-sex relationships

Ohh, and when it comes to the argument that these passages are just about maintaining ritual purity, not moral purity, if that were the case, we’d expect New Testament authors to be silent about gay sex or even declaring Christian freedom from ritual law to engage in gay sex
But instead we see the opposite in Romans and 1 Cor and 1 Tim, leading us to believe that these prohibitions were about both ritual purity and moral purity



The “clobber” passages – Romans 1

Side A: condemning same-sex           idol worship or sexual excess               or breaking gender norms

Response: prohibits female           same-sex sexual activity, so not     about idol worship or gender         norms
#1 Jesus didn’t talk
about gay sex…




[Notes]
Some argue that Rom 1: 18-32 is condemning straight people participating in same-sex rites in honor of idols or sexual excess
Or, because of their views about gender, some argue Rom 1 is prohibiting men from bringing shame upon themselves by playing the receiving role in sex
And perhaps Paul is luring his audience to judge others, only to turn on them and point out that they are no better themselves, as some suggest

But that doesn’t cancel out the fact that Romans 1 goes further than passages we’ve covered so far
Previous passages only referred to male same-sex sexual activity.
Without this passage, one could argue that the Bible merely forbids the sexual practices of some men
But the reference in this passage to female same-sex sexual activity broadens the reference beyond just cult prostitution or pederasty, as those weren’t commonly practiced between two women.

And we can dismiss the argument that the Bible is just prohibiting men from playing the receiving role in sex, because that consideration is irrelevant for female same-sex sexual activity that is still prohibited here



The “clobber” passages – 1 Cor 6, 1 Tim 1

Side A: condemning breaking gender norms or pederasty + author unaware of committed gay relationships

Response: prohibits penetrating and receiving roles in gay sex + Paul aware of committed gay relationships
#1 Jesus didn’t talk
about gay sex…




[Notes]
Some people argue that 1 Cor 6:9-10 and 1 Tim 1:8-10 prohibit men playing the receiving role in sex or pederasty, a romantic relationship between an older male mentor and a teenage male mentee
And again, some will argue that committed, same-sex relationships were nonexistent, so Paul couldn’t possible have intended these prohibitions to be against committed same-sex relationships

yes, it’s true, malakoi​ could refer to pederasty or playing the receiving role in gay sex, and arsenokoitai​ seems to be a new word Paul has coined and there isn’t unanimous agreement about the best translation

But the strong consensus of scholars is that the most reasonable translation for arsenokoitai​ is “men who have sex with men”, or more narrowly men playing the penetrative role in same-sex sexual activity
So Paul goes out of his way by using the word ​malakoi​ and ​arsenokoitai​ in 1 Corinthians 6 and 1 Timothy 1 to condemn both the penetrative and receiving partner in gay sex.

Plus, multiple scholars have demonstrated that while less common, committed same-sex relationships were present and documented in the Ancient Greco-Roman world. (Greek Homosexuality by K. J. Dover + Roman Homosexuality by Craig A. Williams)
Paul was familiar with contemporaries who wrote about such relationships.
So the claim that the authors of Scripture had no awareness of something akin to modern gay relationships is false.


The “clobber” passages are meaningful but unclear

And Jesus didn’t speak directly about gay sex

But…


#1 Jesus didn’t talk
about gay sex…




[Notes]
So you see, all together, these six passages do 4 different things
condemn playing the passive role in male gay sex,
condemn playing the active role in male gay sex, 
condemn female gay sex, and 
identify same-sex sexual desires as broken.
The verses seem to address every possible iteration of same-sex sexual activity and beyond to ensure that the reader is not mistaken.

But its still true that none of these passages refer specifically to a committed same-sex couple
And Jesus doesn’t say anything directly about gay sex or gay marriage
It’d be a lot simpler if in one of the Gospels, Jesus walked up to two faithful Jews of the same-sex who had somehow gotten married, had been faithful to each other for decades, were raising children together in the faith and could clarify whether that was God’s best for those two believers or not

But we don’t need the clobber passages to know God’s wisdom for gay people
And we don’t need to hear Jesus address gay sex directly to know how Jesus thinks Christians should steward their sexualities

Jesus in Matthew 19

Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman

Vocational singleness is the only alternative to Christian marriage



#1 Jesus didn’t talk
about gay sex…




[Notes]
in a single set of thirteen verses at the beginning of Matthew 19, Jesus lays out the two best paths for Christians, speaks to the sexual difference in Christian marriage, and highlights the importance of vocational singleness as the alternative to Christian marriage.

Jesus defines Christian marriage as being a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman,
and he urges everyone to consider vocational singleness for the sake of the kingdom,
recognizing that for some it would be voluntary but for others it would be involuntary.

Furthermore, Paul goes on to confirm these teachings in Ephesians 5 and 1 Corinthians 7



Jesus was clear about God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship for all people
#1 Jesus didn’t talk
about gay sex…




[Notes]
God has made clear to us through the Bible what Christian marriage is and that vocational singleness for the sake of the kingdom is the best alternative
These are God’s best for His people

So no, Jesus didn’t technically condemn homosexuality
But Jesus and the Bible are clear about God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship for all people
And both gay sex and gay marriage are incompatible with that best






Are Christ’s teachings about marriage and singleness enough to know God’s wisdom for gay people? Why or why not?

#2 The Bible doesn’t talk about gay people/marriage as we know it…
It’s true – gay people as a cultural group is man-made 

But 	– there have always been gay people
	– committed gay relationships existed
	– Bible addresses activity, not identity
	– God is not limited by the author
	





[Notes]
homosexual orientation/identity didn't exist in Bible times, therefore the Bible wasn’t talked about gay people or same-sex marriage as we think of it today, therefore any prohibitions are irrelevant

Yes, the idea that “gay” people are a distinct cultural group or a distinct sexuality is something created by man—just like race—to oppress people.
That idea is a recent development. 

But there have always been people who experienced same-sex attraction
There have always been people who exclusively preferred sexual relations with people of the same sex
Any claims that this kind of people didn’t exist in the Ancient Near East are unfounded.

Plus, as we’ve already mentioned, while less common, committed same-sex relationships were present and documented in the Ancient Greco-Roman world.

Regardless, each of the verses we referenced earlier focus on same-sex sexual activity, regardless of the cultural identity of the individual
God is clear through Scripture that same-sex sexual activity is a sin
No one is claiming that the Bible is addressing gay people as a cultural group
The Bible is addressing same-sex sexual activity, regardless of whether the people engaging are gay, straight, bisexual, pansexual, etc.

And even if the authors of Scripture weren’t aware of sexual orientation or sexual identity, that does not limit God’s inspiration of Scripture.
Some argue that Scripture can only mean what it reasonably meant to the author when he wrote it.
But the Church has consistently taught that God is not limited by the understanding of the author.
God can and has inspired authors to write texts beyond the author’s understanding.
Indeed, multiple times in the Old and New Testaments, authors spoke to ideas that would not be fully understood until centuries later.

So in summary, while its true that sexual orientation and identity didn’t exist, as we know it, in the minds of the authors of Scripture,
there have always been gay people,
committed same-sex relationships were present and documented in the Ancient Greco-Roman world,
and God is not limited by the authors of scripture
Plus, we can’t dismiss the prohibitions in Scripture because they address sexual activity, not orientation or identity





If we believed that God was limited by the authors of Scripture and applied that to all of the Bible, what would some of the other consequences be?

#3 The Bible/Christians were
wrong about slavery and women…
It’s true – Christians have used the Bible to justify slavery and oppress women

But 	– God sometimes calls his people to something proximate, not ultimate
	– Trajectory in Scripture toward modern views on slavery and women
	– No trajectory in Scripture about gay sex
Slaves, Women & Homosexuals by William Webb




[Notes]
Many argue that the Bible and Christians were wrong about slavery and gender equality, and in the same way the Bible and Christians are wrong about gay marriage

It’s true, Christians have used the Bible to justify slavery and oppress women
These past couple months white Christians have taken a more honest look at the white church’s complicity in American slavery and racism than ever before, and the legacy of the church is shameful

I’m not going to try to defend Christians or appeal to the credibility of Christians at large as evidence for who is right about gay marriage

But I do think it matters what the Bible says and doesn’t say
And when we take a closer look at how the Bible talks about slavery, gender, and sexuality across the Biblical narrative, we see that these are treated differently

In William Webb’s book “Slaves, Women & Homosexuals” he explains that
The people and place and time that the authors of the Bible spoke into could not have accepted modern ways Christians think about slavery and gender equality
But God is an accommodating God—instead of calling people to perfection he sometimes calls them to something more good that is in reach or within the bounds of their understanding
We do see the way God talks about these things in the Bible change over time—they suggest a trajectory toward the ultimate good

The Old Testament seems to allow, if not encourage, the people of Israel to practice slavery, as long as they aren’t enslaving Israelites
In contrast, Jesus heals slaves and Paul goes as far as to urge Philemon to see his slave as a beloved brother in Christ, not as a slave
The Old Testament seems to treat women as a kind of property,
where as in the New Testament, many women among the followers of Jesus and in positions of leadership in the early church
Ultimately, the Bible points toward what we believe about slavery and gender equality today

However, that same trajectory is not found in how the Bible talks about same-sex sexual activity
It consistently condemns it
God doesn’t seem to be accommodating here, there isn’t a trajectory toward a different, better good
It is a flat line pointing toward the same conclusion throughout time for all people

So in summary, yes, Christians were wrong about slavery and gender equality
And Christians have done a poor job of loving gay people
And perhaps there’s even a shift across the Biblical narrative in what authors call us to
But the Bible does not treat gay sex the same ways as slavery and gender. It does not accommodate across the Biblical narrative. It does not soften or moderate. It is consistent.




To what extent do you buy Webb’s argument that the Bible treats slavery and gender equality different than gay sex?

#4 People don’t choose to be gay, therefore God makes people gay…
It’s true – People don’t choose to be gay

But 	– Science can’t tell us God’s intentions
	– None of us are how God made us to be
	– Romans 1 clarifies that same-sex attractions are broken, not intended



90

[Notes]
we now know that same-sex attraction isn’t a choice
Therefore, God must have made people gay and God must bless monogamous relationships with people God made a person to desire

the consensus among scientists is that both genetic factors and environmental factors contribute to the development of SSA
people neither choose to be gay nor are they born determined to be gay

So it’s true, people don’t choose to be gay
But God didn’t intend for any of us to be gay either

to be clear here, I am just talking about romantic, sexual same-sex attractions
I am not talking about gay culture
or the capacity to recognize and appreciate beauty, regardless of sexual orientation
or the desire for same-sex friendship or plutonic intimacy
the consensus among scientists is that both genetic factors and environmental factors contribute to the development of SSA
people neither choose to be gay nor are they born determined to be gay

even super progressive LGBT scientist have been correcting the movement by pointing out that no one is born gay
not one is born genetically determined to be gay
so on that alone, we can reject that idea that God made us gay in the womb

but yeah, even if we became convinced that sexual orientation is genetically determined—if some flood of new research outweighed consistent results from decades of sexual orientation development research—even if that were the case, that doesn’t mean that God intended for people to be gay.
God’s intentions aren’t a scientific question, they’re a theological one.
Science can’t answer the question of God’s intentions because none of us are how God made us to be.
None of us are born how God first imagined us to be—we are all corrupted at a genetic level before birth, formed brokenly in the womb, and quickly injured by the broken world we are born into.
None of us are how God made us to be.

So, how do we answer that theological question on which science cannot comment?
Romans 1 teaches that same-sex sexual desires are unnatural, they are broken and contrary to God’s first intentions.
God doesn’t not intend for anyone to experience same-sex attraction or to engage in same-sex romantic or sexual relationships
But we also do not choose who we are attracted to

to be clear, I dont think God cursed us with being gay or something like that
but clearly we are gay
so at the very least, God allowed it

so if it’s not what God intended, and it’s broken, but God allowed it and it’s not His will to change it for the vast majority of people
what gives
that doesn’t seem fair

this is where we get into general question of evil territory
why does God allow painful things to happen to innocent people
I shared this morning how I personally answer that question
that in order to preserve our capacity to choose, God refrains from protecting us from the consequences of our decisions and the decisions of others
would God have preferred to block the consequences of those sins of others and protected me from the pain this brokenness has caused me?
yes!
but preserving their capacity to have real choice and humankind’s capacity to have real choice is even more important to God, because it means our love for each other and our love for God actually means something
so he allowed the consequences of the sins of others to remain, he allowed me to develop same-sex attraction

i know that’s not very comforting
but that’s not where the story ends...
God seeks to redeem all brokenness for our good and His glory (Romans 8:28)

So in summary, the problem with this Side A argument is the assumption if people don’t choose to be gay, that must mean God makes people gay
Instead we’ve demonstrated here that none of us are how God made us to be, so how we are today doesn’t tell us anything about God’s intentions
And as we investigate Scripture further, we realize same-sex attractions are broken and God didn’t not intend that for any of us


Some ask at this point: is there anything pre-fall to being gay?

i tend to think that all there is inherently, innately, universally and uniquely to being gay are same-sex attractions
i don’t think there’s some special capacity for friendship or aesthetic sensibility that travels with gay genes for all people
i think most of what we experience as being gay is culturally created, constructed
and hard-earned from the experience of being gay in a certain context

for example, i do think that side b gay christians develop a unique capacity for and appreciation of deeper friendship because of our experiences
we are forced by our circumstances to learn to do friendship better

so is there anything inherently, innate, universal and unique to gay people that existed pre-fall?
we can only really speculate about what pre-fall human existence was like
but what we do know is that today, there’s not much more than same-sex attraction that is inherent, innate, universal, and uniquely gay
and i do not think romantic or sexual same-sex attractions were pre-fall
so it seems like there isn’t anything pre-fall to being gay

that being said, i think a better question is what from the gay experience will remain in the New Jerusalem
because ultimately, we weren’t made for the garden
we were made for the city, for the New Heavens and New Earth
so I think it matters more what we will be there

The scars from Christ’s wounds on the cross could still be seen on His resurrected body. Those physical signs of our sin that Christ took on, those physical signs of our redemption through Christ’s sacrifice, remained because they are a sign of God’s glory, not shame. In the same way, a Christian who experiences same-sex attraction may continue to have awareness of that differentness even in the New Heaven and New Earth because it is through that experience that God was most glorified and the most good came to the lives of gay Christians.
but while differences in this life bind some together more closely but divide others
in the New Heavens and New Earth, our awareness of this common experience will bind us to some, but it will not divide us from any





God didn’t intend anyone to be gay and it is broken, but God allowed it and rarely changes it. That doesn’t seem fair! How can we recognize this injustice and continue to share God’s wisdom?

#5 Sexual orientation doesn’t change, so God must bless gay marriage…
It’s true – There’s no formula for changing sexual orientation

But 	– God didn’t intend for anyone to be gay
	– God has warned us from engaging in same-sex sexual activity




[Notes]
reparative therapy doesn’t work and people’s sexual orientation doesn’t change
So God must be okay with gay marriage
Because if sexual orientation can’t change but God still doesn’t bless gay marriage, that’s just not fair

Well first, we’ve got to answer whether sexual orientation changes

Scripture does not promise permanent relief from any temptation in this lifetime
Limited high-quality research demonstrates that only 3-4% of people who participated in sexual orientation change efforts experienced any change in their same-sex attractions, and even these results were from self-reports that cannot be verified.
No proven combination of spiritual disciplines or counseling to bring about change

Do miracles happen? Yes.
But praying for change expecting God to make you straight can be dangerous

The likelihood of your attractions changing even a little are the same as you getting into Harvard, becoming a millionaire, or playing high school baseball and eventually going pro. Would it be wise to pray for those things expectantly?

What happens when your faith in God, your belief that God is good, or your belief that God loves you hinges on whether you get into Harvard, become a millionaire, or your same-sex attractions change?

So those advocating for a progressive sexual are right
sexual orientation is unlikely to change
And praying for change with expectation can be harmful

Still, God did not intend for us to be gay and God has warned us from engaging in same-sex sexual activity

Why won’t God change my sexual orientation if it is broken? You know, I don’t know
But I do know that gay people are not alone in this experience
There are a lot of people in this world asking why God won’t answer their prayers for healing
Asking why a good God let’s bad things happen to innocent people
I’m not going to be able to provide a satisfying answer to that

But I am comforted that God has promised to redeem the brokenness in my life for my good and His glory
And I’ve seen that to be true
My journey of making sense of my sexuality and serving God with my life has brought more meaning and purpose than I ever expected
But that’s because I’ve been lucky enough to find Christian community to support me on my journey

Unfortunately, many don’t find that
And without the support of the Church, many gay Christians stewarding their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic find that loneliness unbearable
That’s why better arguments aren’t enough
Because when you push back on this argument for a progressive sexual ethic, you reveal that God is calling gay Christians to steward their brokenness in difficult ways that require the support of other Christians

So let’s talk specifically about the challenges gay celibate Christians face and whether better arguments are enough by addressing the next convincing argument for Side A




How many of your churches are places where Christians with persisting same-sex attractions can thrive, with reasonable effort, in vocational singleness or a mixed-orientation marriage?

#6 Celibacy shouldn’t be forced and doesn’t work for many people…
It’s true – longterm abstinent singleness hasn’t work out well for gay people

But 	– God calls Christians to abstinent singleness outside of opposite-sex Christian marriage
	– Vocational singleness isn’t working because straight people aren’t doing it and churches aren’t supporting it




[Notes]
no one should be forced into celibacy, and celibacy doesn’t work for many people

Side A theologians are right to point out that longterm abstinent singleness hasn’t worked out well for a lot of gay people
But that’s not because Christians have somehow forced gay people into abstinence against God’s will

if you’re a Christian, you are born into, forced into a temporary state of abstinent singleness
We can choose to honor God or not, but the state is automatic.
Scripture is clear that for the Christian, the only God-honoring alternative to opposite-sex Christian marriage is abstaining from sex
Even Jesus, in Matthew 19 verse 12, recognizes that some will be celibate for a lifetime, even thought that’s not their preference

Why, if God actually means for us to be so-called “forced” into abstinence, is this feeling of being forced so distasteful?
Because very few Christians really think vocational singleness is good, despite what Jesus and Paul had to say about it
Because our whole life, we’ve heard straight people teaching other straight people that they only have to be abstinent longterm if they want to be
We’ve heard straight people teach other straight people that romance and marriage are the most beautiful things God created
And then they pity people who are single but dont want to are to be. Pitying never-married women, widows, divorcees, etc.
But then they turn to gay people and tell us that being forced into celibacy is good for us
Of course gay people are going to reject that

Which brings me to the last part
If God means for many of us to be abstinent longterm, but its not working, why?
Well its not because gay people aren’t trying hard enough. We have. We are.

And its not because vocational singleness is somehow less natural than marriage
The reality is, in light of the fall, what comes naturally to us is sex and polyamory
Neither faithful monogamy nor abstinence come naturally to us
Everyone has the same inherent but incomplete capacity for marriage and vocational singleness
And all of us need the gift of either vocational singleness or Christan marriage from God to do it well

So, gay people aren’t finding vocational singleness challenging because its somehow less natural than marriage
Gay people are struggling because because straight people aren’t doing vocational singleness and our churches aren’t supporting it

But 	– Churches lead straight Christians to assume romance and marriage, few straight Christians walk out vocational singleness, gay Christians are nearly the only Christians following the singleness of Jesus and Paul
	– Churches don’t teach what the Bible has to say about vocational singleness, procreation, or divorce + celibates can’t find intimacy and permanent family

#6 Celibacy shouldn’t be forced and doesn’t work for many people…




[Notes]
Many of our churches lead straight Christians to assume that they will get married, teach that we need romantic companionship to be happy, and ignore the Bible’s teachings about vocational singleness
As a result, no straight people are seriously considering a life without romance for the sake of the kingdom
gay Christians are nearly the only people who actually consider vocational singleness. Because their circumstances force them to.
And then they are the only Christians actually committing to singleness for the sake of the kingdom in the ways Jesus and Paul describe. But because there are so few gay celibate Christians, the Church doesn’t have to move a finger to support them.
churches can ignore them and neglect to meaningfully invest in the support of celibate people.
That’s why gay celibate Christians are struggling

You see, this is why better arguments aren’t enough
Because if you’re being honest, you’ve got to admit that churches haven’t been teaching what the bible has to say about vocational singleness
Churches haven’t been teaching about what the bible has to say about procreation or divorce
Churches haven’t really been inviting straight people to consider the singleness of Jesus or Paul
Our churches aren’t actually places where those walking out vocational singleness could find the same depth and permanence of family as marriage people
And as a result gay people are the only people walking out vocational singleness and they’re struggling with loneliness, doubt, depression, and suicidality

So telling gay people what the Bible says isn’t enough
You must do what it takes to become churches where gay people could actually thrive in vocational singleness with reasonable effort
We’ll come back to that

In summary, God is actually calling every Christian to abstinence unless they are in an opposite-sex Christian marriage, regardless of our preference
But yes, celibacy isn’t working for a lot of people
But that’s not because God doesn’t mean for us to be abstinent
It’s because the Church is doing a poor job of supporting vocational singleness





If we’re honest, our churches don’t teach about vocational singleness and they aren’t places where anyone could thrive in vocational singleness with reasonable effort. Is it still good to offer vocational singleness as a possibility?

Our churches aren’t actually places where those walking out vocational singleness could find the same depth and permanence of family as marriage people
And as a result gay people are the only people walking out vocational singleness and they’re struggling with loneliness, doubt, depression, and suicidality
#7 Mixed-orientation marriages (MOMs) don’t end well and should be avoided…
It’s true – some MOMs ended disastrously because of secrecy

But 	– MOMs can be healthy with transparency
	– We should not dismiss the possibility for those called to a MOM




[Notes]
The stories of MOMs imploding is proof that MOMs should never be an option

What is a MOM?  Mixed-orientation marriages are opposite-sex marriages where at least one spouse experiences same-sex attraction.

It’s true, many of us have seen the implosion of a MOM that ended in a divorce and hurt everyone involved. 
For decades, pastors and parents told gay people to marry someone of the opposite sex and keep their desires a secret, hoping it would cure their gayness.
But that secrecy was the seed of destruction. 

In response to all of the bad fruit resulting from pushing MOMs, the pendulum has swung to the other extreme.
From the late 2000s to now, many pastors have encouraged all gay people to remain celibate.
They’ve discouraged any gay person from considering a MOM, claiming that they never work and are always unfair to the straight spouse.
So yes, we should be cautious, but if two people feel called to such a marriage, it can be done well.
We shouldn’t pressure people into either vocational singleness or a MOM. We also shouldn’t discredit MOMs.
We typically only hear about the ones that fail, but there are gay people living in beautiful opposite-sex marriages that display the gospel, raising children, and serving in our churches.

Here’s how it can be done well:

First, the gay person needs to share about their sexuality early in the dating process
Recognize that same-sex attraction will likely always be present for the gay person.
You cannot promise someone else that your SSA won’t return.
You must give the other person this information when deciding whether to continue the relationship.
Second, continue to talk about it in marriage.
As with any marriage, communication lines must remain open between spouses.
Spouses need to steward this part of their marriage together.
Third, talk about it with other couples, both MOMs and straight.
Couples in MOMs need other couples in MOMs to talk to – those who “get it” without having to explain everything.
But they also need straight couples to talk to
It’s easy for a couple in a MOM that doesn’t talk with other couples to blame their marital issues on the sexuality of the gay spouse.
But if couples in a MOM share about their challenges with straight couples, they quickly realize that their marital issues are universal challenge that all marriages have to deal with, but they have to share with straight couples to know this!

A key lever for preventing MOMs entered into for the wrong reasons and preventing painful implosions is by making sure vocational singleness must actually be a viable choice.
Among the MOMs that I know that have ended, most of the time the gay person got into the marriage because they believed it was there only option.
So they never really chose the burden and the beauty of marriage.
Unsurprisingly, this did not end well.
Right theology and viable practice of vocational singleness will lead to healthier motivations for entering into MOMs.
If vocational singleness isn’t an option, marriage isn’t either – it becomes a forced choice.
Both MUST be done well for each to be viable.

So in summary, yes, there has been bad fruit of pushing people into MOMs decades ago, but we should not dismiss this possibility for those called to it and who walk this path with transparency

Now understandably, some gay people are triggered by conversation about MOMs and associate it with exgay theology
i appreciate that sensitivity and i get it
i have had many straight people try to push a MOM on me
so when i hear anyone, particularly a straight person raise that possibility with me, particularly when ive made clear that God has called me to lifetime celibacy for the sake of the kingdom, i get triggered
it seems like that because so many gay people had this possibility forced-fed to them for a decade or more, that well is just thoroughly poisoned
its going to be really difficult for some generations of side b gay christians to consider that, because even the thought of it is too triggering

so i respect those who say “you know, i know that’s not what God is calling me to and, to be honest, it’s painful to hear about MOMs”
i think thats fair
i understand gay celibate christians who want to find spaces that speaks specifically to their experience

and at the same time, we should be careful not to further marginalize gay people in MOMs
we need to be careful not the demonize one of the paths available to gay people
and i think we do need to create space to teach the next generation of gay christians about this possibility, particularly since they won’t have the same woundings of MOMs being forced upon them, so they wont be as triggered by the possibility



Is your church fearful of talking about the possibility of a mixed-orientation marriage for gay people?

#8 Traditional sexual ethics bears bad fruit, so it must be wrong…
It’s true – traditional sexual ethics has borne bad fruit in the lives of gay Christians

But 	– there’s just as bad (if not worse) fruit of a progressive sexual ethic
	– it’s the responsibility of pastors and leaders to transform our churches into places where gay Christians are thriving according to God’s teachings




[Notes]
we see the bad fruit of traditional sexual ethics
Therefore the theology must be wrong

I’ll admit, when I look at the lives of gay Christians who have tried to steward their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic, there is a lot of bad fruit
But there’s admittedly just as bad fruit of a progressive sexual ethic

We talked about that this morning
That the average adult same-sex partnership lasts shorter than the average opposite-sex partnership
that the rates of adultery and infidelity are higher in same-sex marriages
But we recognized that those statistics are probably the result of the combination of societal oppression and the bad fruit of not following God’s design
You’re not going to convince anyone with those statistics

I noted that what’s personally convincing for me is that most of my gay Christian friends who adopted a progressive sexual ethic stopped believing in God.
This has not been true for everyone, but it has been true of most people I know
and i wish it wasnt a slippery slope
i wish i saw side a gay christians holding on to their faith and thriving in their relationships with God so much that i questioned whether side b is really how God thinks about sexual ethics
but that’s not been my consistent experience
and every time i share about my consistent experience, over and over again other gay and straight people say “i’ve seen that too, and it makes me cry”
just to give you one concrete sample
in college, i knew about 20 gay christian guys in my christian fraternity
of those, 13 are still christian and side b
5 went side a and are not professing aethists
1 im not quite sure about
and only 1 of them is side a and professes to be a Christian, but if I asked him whether He would profess a historical understanding of the Nicene Creed and reject anything mutually exclusive with the Nicene Creed, he would not be willing to do that

not that’s just 20 people in one space
i know that to make this claim most robustly, i would need a standardized survey of 1000 random gay christians
i dont have that
but 6 out of 6 moving from side a to non-Christian
and 13 out of 14 staying side b and remaining Christian
that’s meaningful

But, the fruit I see of a progressive sexual ethic in the lives of my gay friends is losing their faith.

At the same time, there’s bad fruit of a traditional sexual ethic.
My gay Christian friends who are stewarding their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic are lonely, struggle with sin, and this affects their relationships with God and the Kingdom work they could do.
But just because there’s bad fruit of a traditional sexual ethic doesn’t necessarily mean it’s any less true
I’m convinced that gay Christians stewarding their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic are struggling because our churches have done a horrible job teaching about sexual stewardship for everyone and loving gay people well.
The problem is our churches’ poor application of God’s wisdom
The solution to the bad fruit we see isn't to abandon a traditional sexual ethic, because there’s even worse fruit of a progressive sexual ethic.
No, the solution is for churches to learn how to better embody a traditional sexual ethic in a way that produces good fruit for gay people.

But again, we see that better arguments aren’t enough
You must do what it takes to become churches where gay people could actually thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic with reasonable effort
We’ll come back to that

So in summary, yes, there’s bad fruit of a traditional sexual ethic, but there’s even worse fruit of a progressive sexual ethic
The problem with a traditional sexual ethic isn’t really the theology, it’s the application, and there’s work to do there



How convincing is the argument that a progressive sexual ethic often leads to a loss of faith?

#9 A loving God wouldn’t
deny me a loving marriage…
It’s true – straight Christians have taught that marriage is primarily about commitment and companionship

But 	– the Bible + Church have consistently taught that Christian marriage (joined, sustained by God) is a lifetime union between a man and woman to raise children and embody the gospel




[Notes]
God is love
Marriage is about love
So God wouldn’t deny me marriage

I’ll admit that many straight Christians taught that marriage is merely about companionship and commitment
And that they’ve taught that God wants that for everyone
But those teachings can’t be found in Scripture
And love is more complex than that

Side A theologians often argue that straight Christians believe Christian marriage is primarily about two people loving each other and serving God together, so if a same-sex couple fulfills those requirements, why wouldn’t God bless that union in the same way?

The problem is that this definition of marriage is not how the Bible or the Church have taught about Christian marriage.
Christian marriage—joined, blessed, and sustained by God—is a lifetime vocation between a man and a women to raise children, enjoy intimacy with each other, and embody the relationship in the Trinity and between Christ and the Church in specific ways (particularly the complementarity—both in mind and body—of the sexes joined in sex for the purposes of having and raising children).


But 	– same-sex couples do not fulfill God’s narrow design for Christian marriage, but neither do many opposite-sex marriages
	– real love is willing someone to enjoy the best things God has to offer and helping them take hold of that
	– love = orthodoxy + empathy
#9 A loving God wouldn’t
deny me a loving marriage…




[Notes]
A same-sex couple does not fulfill that purpose.

But neither do a lot of opposite-sex marriages
God doesn’t provide His fullest blessing to the marriage of your opposite-sex non-Christian neighbors.
God doesn’t provide His fullest blessing to the opposite-sex Christian marriage using their vows as a permission slip for sex while blocking the possibility of children.
God doesn’t provide His fullest blessing to the opposite-sex marriage of Christians who were previously in different Christians marriages that ended with biblical grounds for divorce.
We don’t want to be honest about how jealous God is about Christian marriage and what He blesses.
Too often, leaders are willing to speak the truth when it offends gay people on the streets but not when it offends straight people in our churches.

You see, the problem is few churches have been teaching what the Bible really has to say about Christian marriage
That definition of Christian marriage as companionship + commitment + Jesus is just the idolatry of romance from the sexual revolution with Jesus sprinkled on top
but that’s just now what the Bible teaches
and that’s not what a vast majority of Christians today or throughout time believe
the Bible teaches and the vast majority of Christians believe that what makes Christian marriage unique from vocational singleness, from celibacy, is that it’s a space to sacrificially raise children for the sake of the kingdom

so why does this matter
well because we shouldnt be surprised by bad consequences when we misuse something
christian marriage is a space for being on mission sacrificially to raise children for the kingdom
if a christian couple don’t feel called to that, if they aren’t read to accept that mission, they shouldn’t marry
if christians are serious about protecting families from the pain of divorce, we need to take this seriously
i dont want to get into a big argument about contraception, but families that practices NFP are 70% less likely to get divorced than the average christian marriage
we need to think biblically about Christian marriage, because it has real consequences

You want to know why our churches have been doing this so poorly? A lack of discernment
Discernment is how we know whether we are called to the difficult but worthwhile mission of Christian marriage
Discernment is how we know we called to something else if we’re not willing to accept the high calling of Christian marriage
Yet straight Christians haven’t been discerning
They haven’t been open-handedly offer the question of Christian marriage or vocational singleness to God, and ask Him what His preference is
asking Him which gift He wants to give
Jesus and Paul are both clear: God has a preference for which gift He wants to give
And there’s been bad fruit of straight people for not discerning well between Christian marriage and vocational singleness: namely, divorce

but there have also been painful consequences for gay people
because few straight people are stepping into lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom
because side b gay christians are some of the only people really accepting their call to vocational singleness
then our churches get away with neglecting single people
Christians leaders can procrastinate offering family in the body of Christ to widows, divorcees, single parents, and single people who want to marry by simply offering marriage as the solution. Pastors and lay leaders can say, “If you’re lonely, go get married.” At some level, this message translates to, “We are too busy to be family for you. Get married like everyone else so we don’t have to bother.”

churches will only start providing practical support for those called to singleness for the Lord when there are enough people doing vocational singleness to force churches to recognize that God calls a meaningful minority of Christians to a lifetime vocation of singleness for the sake of the kingdom
if 10% of straight Christians accepted their call to vocational singleness, churches would finally accept the responsibility to be family for the vocationally single
then the church would finally be a place where gay celibate christians can thrive

bottom line, if i had a magic wand with one wish
and my goal was to improve the lives of side b gay christians the most i can
i would use that magic wand to compel 10% of straight Christians to accept their call to celibacy
i think that is the key lever



Still, some would say, “I don’t care what the Bible says, God is love, so God must be for love, whatever form it takes.”
The problem with this argument, is that when scripture says, “God is love,” that doesn’t mean that whatever you think love is, God is for that
It’s saying that the God is the author of love, that the kind of love God offers is the original, the purest
It’s saying that if you want to know what love really is, search for what God says love is

We need a better understanding of love than just being nice or kind or giving people what they want
Real love is willing someone to enjoy the best things life has to offer
And the best things come from God, so loving someone is willing them to enjoy what God offers
how do we know what God wants to offer us? The consistent teachings of the Bible and the Church
Let’s call that Christian orthodoxy

but it’s not enough to just point people toward the best things
we have to help people take hold of them
we have to empathize with their experience and be willing to sacrifice to help them thrive
So love = empathy + orthodoxy
empathy without orthodoxy isn’t love
orthodoxy without empathy isn’t love
If we want to imitate God and love people, we will invite them to take hold of the best things according to Christian orthodoxy and help them do so

So in summary, Christian marriage is about much more than commitment and companionship
And love is more than just giving people what they want
God is clear in Scripture His best for us
And if we truly love people, we will help them take hold of those best things





How would this more robust definition of Christian marriage and the jealous nature of God’s fullest blessing change the dynamic with gay and straight people inside and outside of your church?

Churches must become places of thriving

[Notes]
So we’ve covered the 9 most convincing arguments for a progressive sexual ethic
I’ve modeled responding winsomely
And, we’ve pointed out that better arguments alone aren’t enough
I’ve pointed out that churches must do what it takes to help gay Christians stewarding their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic actually thrive
Our churches have got to become places where, with reasonable effort, gay Christians bear good fruit from a traditional sexual ethic

In my intro I cautioned straight pastors not to weaponize a traditional sexual ethic or the arguments ive made here

i think straight christians unintentionally weaponize theology hear, particularly against side b gay christians, because they see we are in pain
and at some level, these straight christians think that if we were just more convinced, more certain of a traditional sexual ethic, then we would magically experience less pain from the Church’s poor support of gay people, celibate people, and those in MOMs
instead of straight christians recognizing that we gay people are experiencing pain because straight people have not done what it takes to make our churches places where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic
straight pastors and parents have been negligent to teach about God’s wisdom and love to gay people to kids before they realize they are gay
straight pastors and parents have failed to get the training they need to care for people like us well
straight pastors and parents apply God’s wisdom in the Scriptures differently to gay people versus straight people, ignoring what the Bible has to say about celibacy and divorce
so yeah, straight pastors and parents need to get busy changing our churches so that we gay people experience less pain

So how can churches do that?
A Vision for Thriving
Become churches where…
Everyone is thinking theologically about their sexuality
Christians talk publicly about the questions gay people face
Every kid knows God’s love and wisdom for gay people
Pastors and lay leaders know how to minister to gay people
Gay people thrive in vocational singleness or Christian marriage

[Notes]
With our last couple of minutes, I was to provide a vision for what it looks like to be churches where gay Christians can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic

First, churches need to invite all Christians to think theologically about their sexual stewardship.
We must teach that God first calls everyone to a period of temporary singleness during which we discern whether we are called to a lifetime vocation of singleness for the sake of the kingdom or a lifetime vocation of Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex.
Our churches should teach that every Christian has the same inherent capacity for both vocations and that every Christian, gay or straight, should offer the question of vocational singleness or Christian marriage to God.
Plus, our churches need to teach that regardless of our vocation, God has made all of us for intimacy in the context of human family, including those called to vocational singleness
 
Second, churches must talk publicly about the cultural questions in the intersection of faith and sexuality.
With compassion and theological accuracy, churches need to explore the following questions:
How does same-sex attraction develop?
What part did God play and why?
Does same-sex attraction change?
How should gay people meet their intimacy needs?
How do gay people fit in God’s story?
How is God’s invitation to gay people good?
As a result, everyone in a church would know how to love gay people well and reflect the love of Christ in conversations about sexuality.
Plus, gay people in a church who are not out yet would know what the church believes and that it is safe to share their story.

Third, churches need to talk about the possibility of same-sex attraction in age-appropriate ways across the lifespan so that teens don’t wait 5 years to tell a parent or pastor and spend 5 years making sense of their sexuality all by themselves with the lies of the Enemy.
Before teens realizes they experience same-sex attraction, teens need to hear that gay people don’t choose who they are attracted to,
that they have nothing to be ashamed about,
that we won’t try to fix them,
that we don’t love them any less,
and that God has good and beautiful plans for them.
Then, when teens realize their same-sex attractions, they would quickly share with their parents and pastors, inviting them to help them learn how to steward their sexuality in God-honoring ways.
 
Fourth, churches must provide effective pastoral care to gay Christians.
They need to do what it takes to gain the competency to provide pastoral care to gay people.
While licensed counselors still may be included to help address clinical levels of anxiety or depression, these churches must recognize that same-sex attractions are not a mental illness to be cured.
Parents and pastors should help gay people integrate their faith and sexuality in ways that lead to thriving in this life and deep relationships with God and friends.

And fifth, churches need to become places where gay people could thrive in vocational singleness or Christian marriage with reasonable effort.
These churches should teach about the theology of vocational singleness in Scripture,
adults should model thriving in vocational singleness and be celebrated in the church,
and the church should invite all people—gay or straight—to discern whether God is calling them to vocational singleness or marriage.
Most importantly, these churches must be places where celibate people can find the same depth of family that married people find, whether that be through intentional Christian communities or living with a married couple.
Then, these churches need to teach about the possibility of mixed-orientation marriages for gay people, cautioning against getting into these recklessly while highlighting the beauty and brokenness of real stories.

That’s just a brief vision of what it looks like to be churches where gay Christians can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic
If we had another hour together, I’d tease out each of those 5 and explore the practical steps your churches can take
But we’re out of time for now



If our churches became this kind of community, would a traditional sexual ethic be true + good + beautiful? What are the biggest barriers to becoming this kind of community?

DISCERNING

SINGLENESS
& MARRIAGE






Singleness & Marriage



Why discern God’s calling to singleness or marriage?
How can we practice Ignatian discernment?
How does one specifically discern singleness and marriage?



Share



Before this class, what has your exposure to discernment been, generally, and specifically applied to the question of singleness or marriage?


WHY DISCERN?







All first called to temporary singleness and discernment, later…
Some called to vocational singleness
Others called to Christian marriage
Why discern?

[Notes]
Remember, Here’s a summary of how Christians have historically understood the Bible to teach about sexual stewardship—about the options available to Christians and how we carefully discern with God how to steward our capacities for connect and make wise decisions about our needs for healthy intimacy

This is the big picture for what it looks like to faithfully, in God-honoring ways, steward our sexualities

We are all first called to temporary singleness (that’s the singleness we’re born into) and discern whether God is calling us to Christian marriage or to vocational singleness (a lifetime commitment to celibate singleness for the sake of the kingdom)
I will provide more evidence for this distinction between temporary and vocational singleness later and what diff that makes






Christian vocation - a calling with a specific design for a specific purpose with a specific provision
Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children
Why discern?

[Notes]
Here’s your reminder of what a vocation is generally and what the vocations of singleness and marriage are

Vocational singleness is a lifetime calling to singleness for the sake of the kingdom
Christian marriage is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to raise children (you may disagree with that definition, that’s okay)






Why discern?

[Notes]
And here’s that diagram representation again

I want to sit here a second
These distinctions were mind-blowing for me when they first became clear from Scripture and Teachings of the Church
None of us on a default path
Not supposed to just take what we want
Shouldn’t continue in the limbo of uncommitted singleness
Two options
Both equal and good and normal but one more common
Need to ask God which He wants me to do
I won’t get the gift from God to do either well until I step out of temporary singleness and COMMIT








Jesus raises the marriage standard
Disciples sardonically suggest lifetime singleness
Jesus: only those whom God gives either marriage or lifetime singleness can accept his teaching, respectively
Scripture: Matt 19

[Notes]
Okay so why discern?
Well, let’s start with scripture

Go pull up the verses on another window

Background: procreation mandate, procreation fulfilled Old Covenant, barrenness and celibacy seen as curse and sin
Also, disciples were teens and just about the age when EVERYONE got married

1 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. 2 Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. 3 Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?” 4 “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’[a] 5 and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’[b]? 6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.” 7 “Why then,” they asked, “did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?”

Okay so what’s going on here? Competing camps are trying to trip him up by asking him to choose a side on divorce

8 Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”

Jesus raising the marriage standard
He calls them back to lifetime monogamy (that exception…)
More conservative than either camp

10 The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.”

This standard was laughably high for the disciples, so they respond with a bitterly sarcastic joke
Lost on modern audience because we don’t see celibacy as a curse like they did
But they are suggesting passing on getting married when everyone else would, which would mean they would never marry, and volitionally being celibate and without children for a lifetime
Would made more sense to us today if they had said “If marriage is really lifelong with only one person, it’d be better for me to mutilate my genitals.”

11 Jesus replied, “Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. 12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”

In v 11 he’s referring to his high standard of marriage
Not everyone can accept this standard
But only those to whom the gift of marriage has been given

Then in v 12, Jesus says that there are others who are called to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom
Not everyone can accept this teaching either
Only those who have been called to it

What does he mean by “eunuch”
Lifetime
Built up the king’s kingdom
Lived in the king’s palace, honored
So we’re talking about a permanent calling of singleness for the kingdom

What do you notice about both marriage and vocational singleness?
They are called and the gift involved a capacity to accept Christ’s high teachings










God gives vocational singleness to some, Christian marriage to others
Committing to either without the gift is dangerous
Better to remain in vocational singleness X4
Scripture: 1 Cor 7

[Notes]
Then there’s 1 Cor 7
We’re going to move through this one more quickly

1 Now for the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” 2 But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband. 3 The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. 4 The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. 5 Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 6 I say this as a concession, not as a command.

In brief, calling married people to faithful monogamy

7 I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.

Paul was permanently celibate after his conversion
He prefers vocational singleness, wishing all were called to it, but
Each has his own gift from God
The gift is from God
He gives the gift
God doesn’t offer each of us both gifts
He offers one to some, and the other to others

8 Now to the unmarried[a] and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do.

Second time Paul shows his preference for lifetime vocational singleness

9 But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.

A common misinterpretation of 1 Corinthians 7:9 is that poor sexual stewardship in singleness shows that one has not been given the gift of singleness and should instead marry.
Now, it’s more accurate to read this as a specific rebuke of Corinthian Christians who had adopted quasi-gnostic ideas that the real us was our mind and spirit
That our bodies were these gross containers we are stuck in for a lifetime but would be thrown away
So it didn’t matter if we mistreated our bodies
As a result, some of these Corinthian Christians were claiming to be celibate in spirit but then engaging in unrestrained sexual immorality because the body didn’t matter
Regardless, the general principle holds true: it is unwise to walk the path of a vocation of singleness without the gift to do it well.
But the same could be said of marriage: it is unwise to engage in some of the activities of marriage without God’s provision that comes from taking marriage vows and stepping into that vocation fully.
MARRIAGE IS NOT A REMEDY FOR WEAKNESS (hurts women+kids and violates the testimony of marriage)

For the sake of time, I’m gonna skip verses 10 - 24
10 To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. 11 But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. 12 To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. 13 And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. 14 For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. 15 But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. 16 How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? 17 Nevertheless, each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. 18 Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. 19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commands is what counts. 20 Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them. 21 Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it trouble you—although if you can gain your freedom, do so. 22 For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord’s freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ’s slave. 23 You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings. 24 Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.

25 Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. 26 Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is. 27 Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife. 28 But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. 29 What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not; 30 those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; 31 those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.

”present crisis” or “present age” consistently interpreted as the age after Christ and before Christ’s return
Not referring to a narrower time
Today no less tumultuous

Here’s the 3rd recommendation to remain in permanent vocational singleness

32 I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord. 33 But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife— 34 and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord’s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband. 35 I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.

The point of vocational singleness is to serve God with undivided devotion

36 If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong[b] and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. 37 But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing. 38 So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.[c]

Complicated passage, but most historical and robust interpretation that it’s referring to early Church practical of spiritual betrothal

39 A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. 40 In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

And here’s our 4th recommendation to remain in permanent vocational singleness

So there’s a lot going on there
To recap, Paul said God calls some to vocational singleness and some to marriage
And Paul praises lifetime vocational singleness

How do we know Jesus and Paul were talking about permanent singleness?
unanimous understanding of the early Church






God has a preference/calling that He wants to share
Both involve a gift received at commitment
Both vocational singleness and Christian marriage are permanent
Why discern?

[Notes]
Okay, so why discern?

1. God has a preference and wants to communicate that preference to us.
the Bible teaches that our vocation is given or called, not chosen
And this makes sense, certainly God can imagine all of our possible futures and tell each of us personally whether singleness or marriage will lead to more goodness for us and more glory for God

2. Both vocations involve a gift to accept the teachings and the call, and a gift in response to accepting the call to do it well, a provision of grace (more later on why we need this)

3. God intended for Christian marriage and vocational singleness to be committed and permanent.
We’ve already heard the evidence from Matt 19 + 1 Cor 7 and the unanimous understanding of the early Church
If we needed any more…
We cannot imagine Jesus providing the 100-fold blessing promised in Luke 18:28-30 to someone who has only temporarily given up the prospect of marriage and children, only to later get married.
Then in 1 Timothy 5:5-15, Paul reaffirms that a commitment to vocational singleness is good and to break that commitment is a sin.







Temporary singleness not mentioned or gifted
There is no default path
Unwise to unthinkingly take what we want
Why discern?

[Notes]
4. temporary singleness not mentioned or gifted
Show me a verse that commends temporary singleness or speaks for a gift for it

5. no default path
We’re obviously not born into committed celibacy or Christian marriage
Both Matt 19 and 1 Cor 7 speak about intentionally stepping into one or another and caution against do so lightly

6. doesn't seem like we just get to take what we want
Our preference does not matter
We can share our preference with God, but ultimately we should learn what God’s preference is and ask Him to conform our desires to His desires







Is the word discernment used in the Bible in this specific way? No.

But it leaves an undeniably discernment-shaped hole that the Church has consistently commended.
Why discern?

[Notes]
is the word discernment used in any of these passages? no
but all of this leaves an undeniably discernment-shaped hole
and its the conclusion of the early Church, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Max Thurian, and Karl Barth

if there's no default path, if we must step forward out of temporary singleness and commit to something in order to receive the gift, if both vocations are permanent, if God has a preference and is calling us, if we're not supposed to just take what we want or step forward recklessly
how do we learn God's preference from him? how do we hear the call? how do we know which path to step toward? how do we make sure we consider this question carefully?
DISCERNMENT

So God eventually calls most of us to either a vocation of marriage or a vocation of singleness. And everyone should discern this question of vocational singleness or Christian marriage
We should all open-handedly offer these possibilities to God and seek His preference

Are you convinced?
Why or why not?
What objections or hesitations linger?






Why not just continue in temporary singleness?
I want to marry and be a parent, so that must be God’s desires…
Lifetime singleness is more natural than lifetime faithful monogamy
Reasonable objections

[Notes]
I want to address some reasonable objections

Why not just continue in temporary singleness? What difference does it really make? 
Well, there’s a big difference between the singleness we’re all born into and experience as children vs. committed, lifetime, vocational singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work.
There’s a big difference between just waiting for marriage vs. accepting a call to permanently give up the possibility of romance, marriage, sex, and children in order to use that availability to do kingdom work that parents can’t.

Additionally, those who continue indefinitely in temporary singleness are likely to be shallowly rooted in their spiritual families and uncommitted to the kingdom work they’re doing because they have to stay prepared to reorganize their lives around a (potential) spouse at any moment.

Plus, the two passages where Jesus and Paul encourage Christians to consider celibacy aren’t commending temporary singleness—they’re commending committed, lifetime singleness.

In order to receive the gift from God to do vocational singleness well, we have to step out of temporary singleness and into committed singleness.
So if someone is in temporary singleness, without the gift of singleness, and struggling, perhaps part of the difficult is that they haven’t receive the gift yet

That being said, there are always exceptions to the rule. God will choose not to give some Christians a call to marriage or vocational singleness. For some, faithfully following God’s guidance will look like continuing to leave open the possibility of both vocational singleness and marriage in their 30s, 40s, 50s, or perhaps for their entire life. While less common than either vocational singleness or marriage, faithfully continuing in temporary singleness should be honored and supported in our churches.   

2. i want to marry, be a parent, so that must be God's desires...
Most of the celibate Protestants and Catholics I know still experienced a healthy desire for marriage, sex, and children before committing to singleness for the Lord, so those desires aren’t an indication of God’s preference. 

3. singleness is too difficult and isn't natural...

Well, not quite
Does the average Christian automatically possess everything they need to thrive in vocational singleness? No.
But the same is true of marriage. We don’t have what we need to do marriage well either.
In light of the Fall, romance, sex, and polygamy are natural.
Each of us has the same inherent but incomplete capacity for both vocational singleness and marriage
But to do either well, we must step into that vocation and receive an additional gift to do it well

So we should discern and settle down into either marriage or vocational singleness because none of us have what we need inherently to thrive in Christian marriage or vocational singleness






But Jesus says “choose” in Matt 19:12
What are the consequences of not discerning or ignoring God’s call?
Why discern if one is much more common?
Reasonable objections


[Notes]
4. But in Matt 19:12, doesn’t Jesus say “choose” to live like a eunuch for the sake of the kingdom?

Doesn’t that contradict what we’re saying here?
Actually, we agree that one’s relational vocation should be entered into voluntarily.
No one should be forced into marriage or forced into vocational singleness.
But this doesn’t mean that all that matters is our own preference or desire.
This doesn’t mean that we only have to be single or married if we really want to.
Christ’s teachings make it clear that God has a call for us and that we should obey that call.
God intends for our preference to be conformed to His preference.
But no one should be forced into celibacy before their will has aligned with God’s, just as no one should be forced into a marriage without being called to it and recognizing that call.
Jesus’s use of the word “chosen” should be a clear admonishment of anyone being forced into a relational vocation if they haven’t discerned that call.


5. what if we ignore God's preference or never seek it? consequences of not discerning?
I don’t think God is going to strike down someone’s marriage or celibacy, even if it wasn’t His best
I think God wants us to be faithful to our commitments and He will provide the gift of grace to do it well
But for some, maybe the reasons things are difficult is because it wasn’t God’s best path for them


6. why discern if one is much less common?
90% is pretty good odds
But if we all assume marriage
90% will take it for granted, assume they are owed it, not see it as a gift, now own the responsibility
And the 10% will feel cheated
100% of people open-handedly discerning will lead to 100% of people joyfully accepting God’s call and faithfully walking it out

Discerning Vocations



Why discern God’s calling to singleness or marriage?
How can we practice Ignatian discernment?
How does one specifically discern singleness and marriage?

[Notes]
before we discern specifically between singleness and marriage, we need to make sure we've built up our spiritual muscles for general Christian discernment







“…The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice…”
–John 10:1-5
Christian Discernment

[Notes]
John 10:1-5 says

“Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber. The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.”

What is Jesus describing here?
A shepherd who leads his sheep with his voice
Sheep who listen for the shepherd’s voice
Sheep who follow the shepherd’s voice
WHY?
BECAUSE THEY KNOW HIS VOICE

Discernment is all about knowing God’s voice
And then following it
we want to be the sheep who listen to the shepherd's voice and follow
There are lots of different Christian traditions of discernment, but the most robust and popular and concrete is Ignatian Discernment







[Notes]
My favorite, accessible book about Ignatian Christian discernment is God’s Voice Within by Mark Thibodeaux
A lot of what we’re talking about today is from this book

I highly recommend reading the book and digesting these ideas on your own time






“…once a person can recognize the motivations moving her toward one particular choice or another, then…she simply chooses the options that comes from God…the tricky part is not in the act of choosing option A, B, or C but that in creating an internal skill (an Ignatian intuition) of recognizing the motives attracting and repulsing you toward or away from any given option.”
Ignatian Discernment

[Notes]
Here’s the authors summary of Ignatian Discernment:

"St. Ignatius of Loyola is one of Christianity's most important teachers of discernment. And yet, Ignatius himself did not write a systematic, step-by-step, follow-the-recipe sort of guide to making a decision. He knew that every decision carries with it so many variables that a cookie-cutter method would be contrived and clunky. Humans are simply too complex for a one-size-fits-all discernment manual.

Instead, Ignatius set out to teach people how to become a kind of person who, through a sort of learned intuition, could detect the sources of one's thoughts, emotions, and actions. Through that discernment of the sources, which he called the discernment of spirits, a person can determine God's will in any given situation. In other words, once a person can recognize the motivations moving her toward one particular choice or another, then the work of coming to a decision becomes easy: she simply chooses the options that comes from God. OK, maybe the choice still isn't always easy, but the point is that the tricky part is not in the act of choosing option A, B, or C but that in creating an internal skill--an Ignatian intuition--of recognizing the motives attracting and repulsing you toward or away from any given option."






God sometimes nudges us using our thoughts and feelings
But we must discern whether a nudge is truly from God, the Enemy, or ourselves
Requires spiritual health + practice discerning internal voices (aka self-awareness)

Ignatian Discernment

[Notes]
To put it another way, St. Ignatius…
believed that God sometimes shares nudges with us toward the right things
but we have to figure what the nudge is, specifically
AND we have to distinguish between God, the Enemy, and ourselves
whether to trust the nudge or not

This requires general spiritual health
AND practice discerning and attuning oneself to God's voice and interpreting common emotional responses to God versus Enemy versus self
ALL ABOUT SELF-AWARENESS

but before discerning, we must determine whether we're even in a good emotional/mental/spiritual space to discern (and what to do about it)

“...the peace of consolation is the state of being at peace specifically about the various agitations and temptations of my life.

[Notes]
When in desolation
name it
don't make changes/decisions

address sources of desolation/problems

God never causes desolation, but He does permit it to come. There are three causes of desolation: logistical, moral, and psychological. Only one of those implies culpability on our part. “It’s important to note that if I am in desolation I should not presume that it is my fault. On the contrary, for a devout Christian, desolation does not usually come because of sin.” 
-  “If sin is not the culprit for desolation, perhaps the problem lies with some logistical detail...Often making a simple adjustment regarding when, where, or how long I pray [or order my life in other ways] will do the trick.” 
-  “Perhaps the roots of the desolation are psychological rather than spiritual." 

be gentle, patient, and encouraging with yourself
have faith that God will make good use of this time

“Desolation, however, is not a wasted period. It’s an opportunity to receive the more difficult graces 
that can come only through a bit of suffering...Ignatius suggests three difficult graces in particular that the desolate one has the potential of receiving: repentance, fortitude, and humility. I would suggest others as well: patience, trust, self-assurance, self-confidence, wisdom, and unwavering loyalty toward God and toward Christian commitments.”

Center discernment on the big question: What do I seek?
Practice gratitude
Ask, “Do I want God’s greater glory?”
Ask, “Am I open-handed and desire to receive what God says is best?”
A good foundation

[Notes]
Just before discerning, let’s establish a good foundation

when you're ready to discern: center all discernment on the big questions, "What do I seek?”

Consider your life mission statement, and if you don’t have one, consider entering into a process to
discover your life mission statement. What is the purpose of life? What is the purpose of MY life? What is it that gets me out of bed every morning? When I am old and near death, what sort of life would I be proud and happy to look back on?

practice gratitude
do I want God's greater glory?

Once a person names that greatest desire of all, she then finds herself ready to give up whatever 
does not lead to the glory of God and ready to take on whatever will lead to the greater glory of 
God.

am I open-handed and believe that whatever God's nudges will be best?

My Discernment Story

[Notes]
Part of my process of discerning between vocational singleness and marriage was honesty with myself about the desolation in my life and what the false spirit might be pulling me away from. I knew I was discerning in a time of desolation—I was 6 years into a still-ongoing dark night of the soul that led to unstable faith, hope, and love. Already I knew this wasn’t an ideal state in which to discern and I was wary of my vulnerability to false spirits. I recognized my desire to control my future, my fear of going without a vocation. I was afraid of waking up twenty years into a marriage and feeling stuck. I noticed plenty of false consolation in my life—busying myself with work and caring for others that were good but had the potential of being distractions from the best things God wanted me to consider. Unsurprising to my friends, I experienced a fear of being misled by the false spirit, and I didn’t know how to categorize my meta musings. Nonetheless, an honest assessment of the desolation was key to my discernment. It created space to then look at sources of consolation

As I examined my own heart, I was relieved to find consolation and the feeling that the true spirit was indeed pulling me toward vocational singleness. When I looked more deeply at my anger and fear, instead of seeing disruption of my life, I saw a renewed commitment to seeking justice and truth. In response to hardship I was leaning on God and others more, and I recognized these as seeds of faith, hope, and love instead of desolation. Perhaps I was actually in a season of consolation, despite the challenges in my life, and I could trust my discernment. I saw a courage and great desires to bring goodness to the lives of others and a willingness to walk out vocational singleness, even if the path was difficult. Finally, I saw my fear of being led away by the false spirit as a desire for transparency. I wanted to discern carefully, and the consolation leading my discernment was evidenced in my willingness to share honestly with myself and others about thoughts and feelings that came up in my process, regardless of how they might make me look or where they might lead. So, what next?

At the end of my first year of intentional discernment, I felt a vague pull toward singleness for the Lord and away from marriage. To gain further clarity, I needed a way to organize my thoughts, a way to sift through the jumbled mess in my head and heart. I leaned into the process offered by Ignatian discernment. Thibodeaux stages wise discernment along three phases: laying a good foundation for decision-making, discerning wisely, and then seeking confirmation.

As I asked these questions of myself, I experienced clarity and gratitude. Over the past decade, I had gained clarity about God’s purpose for my life—something few of my peers have experience and something I know to count as a blessing. I knew that God made me to help the Church become a place where LGBT+ people could belong and thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic. No matter how many disappointing reactions from pastors, how many stories of pain I heard from other LGBT+ people, or how many hours of monotonous fundraising tasks, I was eager to get out of bed in the morning to do this work. I was also self-aware of my biases against both marriage and vocational singleness, which allowed me to identify them and address them. In time, I clear those biases from my heart and mind, and I arrived at a point where I could honestly tell God, “I’ve got a preference, I am cool with whichever path you have for me.”

Gathering data came easily to me—I’m a scientist and therapist by training. My life experiences and desires both pointed me toward vocational singleness. I seemed to possess an uncommon willingness to accept the call of celibacy, and God had stoked in me a deep desire for the Church to better teach about and support vocational singleness. Plus, celibacy would create the space in my life to do the kind of work I felt called to. At the end of my second year of discernment, I was 70% confident that God was calling me to lifetime singleness. Then two moments at the end of year three bumped my confidence meter from 95% to 100%:
 
The first was with my small group at church. We had spent half a year focused on the idea of discernment—what providence! Each week, a different person would share a question he or she was discerning, provide additional information about the person’s current discernment, lead us in a time of prayer to hear anything the Holy Spirit wanted us to receive, and then invite the rest of the group to share any spiritual wisdom or practical advice. When my night came, I knew what question I would ask: Am I called to marriage or vocational singleness? I shared with the group about what I had read, why I felt personally called to singleness for the Lord, and the questions that still lingered for me. We prayed. And then for the next half hour, each of the people in my small group shared their confidence that God was indeed calling me to singleness. They spoke about the joy my story and work brought them and how my testimony challenged them to think more carefully about their own sexual stewardship.
 
Then just a few weeks later, I went to dinner with a woman I met through work. This was in zero ways a date, but as the dinner progressed, I found myself drawn to her. Her personality was refreshingly honest and witty. She too was gay and committed to a traditional sexual ethic. I was struck by her natural beauty. Once again, I was confused. Women infrequently affect me this way, and just after the time with my small group that seemed to confirm my calling to singleness. After dinner I sat in my car working through the dilemma in my head, and I started having a conversation with God. I’m not saying that I audibly heard God. I didn’t. But sometimes I imagine asking God a question and I predict His answer based on what I know of God’s character. Most of the time this is just an imaginative way to apply the Bible to specific circumstances. But occasionally, the responses I come up with feel like they have more weight—like the Holy Spirit is saying, “Listen to that!” This “conversation” with God in the car after dinner with the interesting woman was one of those times:
 
Pieter: God, I’m so confused. First you seem to push me toward singleness. Now you seem to be pushing me toward marriage. Which is it? Would it really be good for me if I married someone like Emily?
God: Yes, it would be good.
Pieter: But then I couldn’t experience the awesome, unique aspects of singleness for the Lord. Would that singleness be good for me?
God: Yes, that would be good, too.
Pieter: So what should I do? If I choose the wrong one, would that ruin my life?
God: No, both would be good for you.
Pieter: But is one of them better for me? More great?
God: Yes. Marriage would be good and beautiful for you. But singleness for the kingdom would be even better. You can do either. You choose.
Pieter: Okay, then I choose singleness.
 
After that last statement, I felt a profound peace. Like stepping into the shower already set to the perfect temperature or admiring the lines in the grass of a freshly cut lawn. I knew that that choice of singleness fit for me. After years of searching, I knew the answer. God preferred for me to be single for Him, and I was ready to say “yes!”
 
The confirming experiences on the quasi-date with the woman and discernment conversation with my small group came shortly after offering my decisions to God tentatively. Eventually, I reached a point of confidence about my vocation, but it wasn’t quick or born out of some undeniable emotions. The evidence lined up, I took steps, experiences confirmed my hunch, and I enjoyed increased joy as I dreamed about a life of helping the Church and offering family to other celibate people. 








“[A] vocation is revealed by the light of the Holy Spirit which creates peace and joy; by a man’s past life and present circumstances interpreted as signs of God’s providence; in the act of faith and the self-commitment based on the Word of God; and by the counsel of the Church, which gives by the laying-on of hands the seal of God on the choice of man and the power of the Holy Spirit which enables him to remain faithful.” 
Discernment

[Notes]
How do we apply Ignatian Discernment to the specific question of marriage or celibacy? What specific data do we need to gather for this question? What resources can we seek?
 
As I read through God’s Voice Within and enjoyed Max Thurian’s Marriage and Celibacy soon after, I realized that the process of discernment I had cobbled together over the past few years wasn’t an accident or anything new. The Holy Spirit had been guiding me along a process of discerning one’s relational vocation discovered long ago in Ignatian Discernment and applied to this specific question by wise theologians like Max Thurian. He gives this summary of discernment:
 
“[A] vocation is revealed by the light of the Holy Spirit which creates peace and joy; by a man’s past life and present circumstances interpreted as signs of God’s providence; in the act of faith and the self-commitment based on the Word of God; and by the counsel of the Church, which gives by the laying-on of hands the seal of God on the choice of man and the power of the Holy Spirit which enables him to remain faithful.”








5 Ingredients for Wise Discernment
Grow your ”spiritual muscles” for general discernment
Remove any emotional or theological barriers to clear discernment
Consider what kind of work you might be called to
Consider your past and current circumstances
Seek support from your church
Discernment

[Notes]
I can’t take any credit for what follows—I merely stumbled upon ancient wisdom that God had conveniently placed in my way. But instead of being a clear, step-by-step equation for squeezing an answer from God, the process of discerning one’s relational vocation looks more like collecting the best ingredients for discernment, mixing them together, and then continuing to stir as you gain increasing confidence in God’s call. Here’s the five ingredients:
Develop your general spiritual muscles for discernment, as described in the previous chapter
Gain a healthy theology of marriage and celibacy, including removing any theological or emotional barriers to clearly hearing God’s call
Consider how your occupational vocation may be better complemented by marriage or celibacy
See if your past and present circumstances suggest God’s providence toward one vocation or another
Seek the wisdom of pastors, parents, mentors, and friends
 
A word of caution about these ingredients: no one ingredient is meant to reveals God’s preference to you. That goes both ways. Just because you want to get married and your Christian college roommate dreamed about being in your wedding doesn’t mean your discernment process is over. We each need to take the time to collect each of these ingredients and patiently seek mature confirmation of our intuition. But this also reassures the person who is collecting these ingredients and one question seems to point them toward the vocation they don’t want. Don’t fret or give up. Just keep discerning. Most who wisely discern will find a mix of signals among the fruit of seeking each of these elements of discernment, but the results will probably lean in one direction or the other. Then after patiently seeking confirmation from God for that leaning, God will provide the confidence we need—usually just short of the amount we desire, but just enough to take the next step. Let’s explore each of those ingredients. Thurian, 88






Study the Bible and Church teachings about theologies of vocational singleness and Christian marriage
Remove emotional barriers with a pastor or therapist
Awareness, not preference-lessness

2. Theology + Emotions

[Notes]
The second major ingredient in healthy discernment of one’s relational vocation is theological and emotional openness. We want to ensure that we have a healthy theology of marriage and celibacy, free of any theological or emotional hurdles to discernment. We need a good theological foundation.
 
A clear understanding of God’s design for the vocations of marriage and singleness will give you a better framework in which to digest the other ingredients for discernment. Many great resources about how the Church has historically understood God to have revealed his design for these vocations in Scripture have already been written, and more still may be needed.
 
If you could read only two books, I would suggestion you read Breaking the Marriage Idol by Kutter Calloway and Marriage and Celibacy by Max Thurian. Calloway’s Breaking the Marriage Idol is the best analysis of western cultural Christianity’s relationship with romance, and it includes some preliminary suggestions for how we can better teach about and support both marriage and vocational singleness. Max Thurian’s Marriage and Celibacy is by far the best text on the theology of vocational singleness.
 
Other standouts for the Christian’s theology of marriage include Theology of the Body by Pope John Paul II, Mere Sexuality by Todd Wilson, and Divine Sex by Jonathan Grant. While I am not a Catholic, JPII’s Theology of the Body is a must-read for any Christian (or you can read Christopher West’s Theology of the Body for Beginners if you can’t make it through the original text). In short, Christian marriage (a marriage blessed and sustained by God) is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to enjoy intimacy with each other, raise children, and embody the gospel for each other and the world.
 
On the topic of vocational singleness, The Significance of Singleness by Christina Hitchcook and Singled Out by Christine Colon and Bonnie Field are both valuable explorations of the topic, but fall short of approaching the topic with the same theological depth as Max Thurian. Another helpful resources is Toward a Protestant Theology of Celibacy by Russell Hobbs—a great review of all of the Christian literature on the topic of celibacy.
 
Just as important as having the right theological foundation, we also need to remove some obstacles that might have accrued over time. We develop and continue to live in a broken world. Loneliness, divorce in your family, sexual sin, heartbreak, abandonment, rejection, and a host of other emotional wounds related to marriage, singleness, and family can bias our discernment. The Christian would benefit from processing those wounds with a parent, pastor, or counselor to remove any hurdles to clearly hearing God’s calling.
 
Poor theology and emotional wounds can be serious hurdles. A friend named Brett grew up in a church that rarely taught about God’s design for relationship, and his family was wrecked by divorce and a constant pursuit of the next right person. Unsurprisingly, Ben grew up to believe that friendship could never provide for him what he needed. He wasn’t interested in considering singleness for the Lord. He didn’t see any beauty in the possibility, and hoping romance would satisfy was all that was modeled growing up. Sadly, Ben has not been the first friend to share these sentiments, and he’s unlikely to be the last. Friends share honestly that they’ve never considered lifetime singleness, and then don’t intend to. They share with a proud defiance, not out of conceit, but because they don’t know any better. They don’t understand that God has actually commanded us to discern. They are ignorant because they were never taught. They sin in ignorance. But the damage on their lives, the people they marry despite God’s preference for singleness, and the damage on the Church remains the same.
 
With each of these ingredients for discerning marriage or vocational singleness, I want to emphasize signs a person might be called to vocational singleness. To be clear: I do not want anyone to mistakenly discern vocational singleness anymore than I want Christians to mistakenly discern marriage. But too few Christians have discerned a call to vocational singleness. While at least 90% of Christians will be called to marriage, it’s reasonable to assume that God wants to call at least 5% of Christians to vocational singleness. Yet less than 1% of Christians accept a call to vocational singleness in the modern era. As we explored in Chapter 2, considerable momentum pushes Christians toward romance and marriage. Combined with the poor teaching of and support for vocational singleness in the Church, Christians God wants to call to vocational singleness do not know how to listen for the call. The Church would benefit from particularly training each Christian to listen for the call to celibacy so that the 5-10% of Christians actually being called to vocational singleness accept the call.
 
To that end, as you’re studying theology of marriage and vocational singleness, if you find the theology of vocational singleness particularly beautiful, pay attention to that. That doesn’t necessarily mean you are called to vocational singleness. Those ultimately called to marriage will find theology of singleness appealing as well. But a deep appreciation for the theology of vocational singleness may be an early sign of a Christian’s calling.

Perhaps if you’re called to be a pastor, teacher, helping professions, etc., vocational singleness is better suited?
Or perhaps you feel called to raise children as your primary kingdom work
Or neither…
3. Occupational Vocation

[Notes]
The third ingredient for discernment takes into account your day job. What kind of work has God called you to? Does that point you toward vocational singleness or marriage? Max Thurian puts it this way:
 
“It should be added that celibacy is only a circumstance, a state and a position demanded by a call of God which is greater and more complex—a special mission or a difficult ministry which would make family life impossible and which requires complete unattachedness; a life of contemplation or study which calls for entire freedom of spirit; life in a regular community for the sake of witness or of a freely available ministry in the Church. So celibacy cannot be considered a vocation for its own sake, but only in terms of a special service for God”.
 
Pastors, teachers, and other occupations in the helping professions that require numerous hours of work after 5 pm will be the first to tell you: it is difficult to be a good parent to both your church, classroom, etc. and to your family at home. While I don’t advocate for mandatory priestly celibacy, one of the primary reasons the Catholic Church asks its pastors to be celibate is so that they can fully commit themselves to their parish family. Inherent in the stories of pastors, teachers, and others seems to lie a recognition that raising children is a full-time job that might be incompatible with some occupational professions and with some kingdom work. Paul understood this in 1 Corinthians 7: 32-35 when he spoke about God’s design for vocational singleness. A key feature of Paul’s singleness was that he could fully commit himself to the kingdom work he had been called to because he didn’t have the do the important and costly work of raising a family.
 
Perhaps the kind of work you are called to is more compatible with either marriage or vocational singleness. For example, if you feel called to a special mission, a difficult ministry, or a life of contemplation or study, then a vocation of singleness might be the vocation best fitted to your work. Freedom from raising children will allow you to more fully commit yourself to the kingdom-building work God has called you to.
 
Toward the end of college, God made clear his call on my work: to teach the Church how to better love and serve gay people like me. Fast-forward to today, I run a ministry called EQUIP. Why do I mention all of this? Jesus invited the disciples to consider singleness for the sake of the kingdom. The singleness he commends in Matthew 19 and Paul urges in 1 Corinthians 7 is for a purpose. Those who find themselves called to kingdom work that might be better complemented singleness would benefit by pausing and asking: “Might God have planned for me to step into vocational singleness all along so that I could best carry out the kingdom work God has given me?” That’s the question I asked, and the obvious answer was, “Yes!” If my time and energy were divided between work and raising children, I doubt the mission would be accomplished. Even without children, the work God has given me to do seems impossible. How much less likely would I be to fulfill God’s intentions for me if I was a full-time minister and a full-time parent? God seemed to be calling me to kingdom work that would require a fuller commitment than parents could give, so singleness for the sake of the kingdom made sense for me.
 
On the other hand, you might feel particularly called to the work of raising children to become faithful and fruitful Christians. This is the case for my friend Chase. As I was discerning my call, he did the same. But as I became convinced that I was called to kingdom work that necessitated being singleness, he was increasingly convinced that the kingdom work he was called to was specifically to raise children. God grew in him a healthy desire to raise children—not to serve himself or fulfill dreams of being a parent—but because raising children for the kingdom was a difficult and important work that needed to be done well by those willing to live sacrificially. As I sought confirmation that God was calling me to vocational singleness, Chase hesitated to date too seriously until he received confirmation from God that marriage was His call.
 
Many of my friends see their work as a mother or father as their primary calling, and then their occupation—the work they get paid for—is merely a means to an ends. Certainly, they prefer work that pays well, matches their skills and interests, and is participating justly in the economy. But their first job is their family. People drawn to this vocation are likely called to marry and raise children.
 
Most people, however, don’t feel confidence in either of these directions. They don’t feel a clear calling to a work that would be better served by a vocation of singleness. But they also don’t feel a particular calling to raise a family as their primary work. Don’t get me wrong—many people want to make a different in the world and be a parent, but those leanings don’t tell us much about whether God is calling that person to marriage or a vocation of singleness. And that’s okay. For some this line of exploration will be fruitful, and for others it will not. But thankfully there are many ways a person might collect data to use in their discernment.

What difference would it make if most pastors, teachers, and people in the helping professions accepted a call to vocational singleness?






Has God left breadcrumbs to suggest my future path?
“…spiritual direction of these people should gradually lead them to consider that, if they ask for it, God will grant them the gifts necessary for accepting a way of life which they did not choose...”

4. Past + Present

[Notes]
The fourth ingredient for discernment searches for God’s providence in our past and present circumstances. Has God been trying to tell us something? Has He been gently nudging us toward one vocation or another? Perhaps you find yourself single later in life and ask, “I am still single not by accident, but because God has called me to a vocation of celibacy?” I’m not saying that every adult who is single later in life has been called to lifetime singleness. But perhaps if someone is single later in life, that is a sign of God’s intentions.
 
Thurian says it this way: “...the circumstances of life can be signs of the vocation of God. The Lord, who directs all things by his providence, can show a man in his life history his intention of calling him to celibacy. St Paul recalls the meaning of a person’s past history when he writes to the Corinthians...(1 Cor 7:17-24). The apostle does not, of course, make past history into a determinism...But he sees in past life and in present circumstances, in the state or the condition assigned to each man, a result of the providence of God and a way of being led to hear the call of God and of serving him.”
 
So perhaps if someone is single later in life, that is because God intends for them to be single. Now this is a tricky subject, on which I think Thurian’s words would again be helpful: “We have not forgotten that there are people for whom unmarried life was not a free and voluntary choice but was rather an obligation imposed on them by the circumstances of their life. They were not able to marry, although they would have liked to do so. We should not speak of vocation or choice on the part of these men and women. However, this does not mean that the hard sacrifice which was imposed on them cannot take on a meaning in the plan of God. They can realize afterwards that this condition which was imposed on them has enabled them, in spite of great difficulties, to serve the Church more freely. The spiritual direction of these people should gradually lead them to consider that, if they ask for it, God will grant them the gifts necessary for accepting a way of life which they did not choose...”

What would it take to move from involuntary singleness to chosen vocational singleness?






Involve parents, pastors, mentors, and friends
Seek out a spiritual director
5. Seek Others’ Wisdom

[Notes]
The fifth and perhaps most obvious ingredient for discerning between vocational singleness and marriage is getting the advice of others. Our parents, pastors, mentors, and friends have unique perspective on our lives. They might come alongside you in your study of theology of marriage and celibacy. Maybe they’ve grown up with you and know what emotional barriers you might be experiencing to open-handedly offering this question to God. Perhaps they can help you process emotional wounds standing in the way of receiving from God. The connect between your work and your relational vocation might be more apparent to your friends. Or maybe they see God’s providence in your life in ways you can’t.
 
Thurian urges Christian not to be alone in their discernment, but instead include their church, in the following ways: “Finally, the Christian is not alone in his decision; he is attended by the Church, by a community, by spiritual direction which can help him to discern his vocation. In this way he can avoid the subjectivity of a too personal choice. The counsel of his fellow Christians will give his resolution the objective character that will reassure him in moments of doubt.”
 
Moreover, inviting others to help us in this process means more voices lifting up your discernment to God and more hearts listening for God’s guidance. As I shared previously, bringing this question to my small group at church provided some of the last confidence I needed to step into vocational singleness. They prayed for me and for my discernment. They offered me advice from their own observations of my work and relationships. But most importantly, they each shared about a peace and confidence from the Holy Spirit that I had been discerning wisely.

“A man will never have complete certainty concerning his vocation and the rightness of his choice. He must, to a certain extent, make a leap in the dark. Sometimes it is not until after decision and self-commitment that a vocation becomes clearer and more certain…”
On Confidence

[Notes]
Once you’ve gathered all of the evidence you can, leaned into the discernment process, arrived at a plausible conclusion, and tested this conclusion, there’s only one thing left to do: take a leap. Often, we will find ourselves wishing for more confidence before taking another step, but Thurian offers this encouragement:
 
“A man will never have complete certainty concerning his vocation and the rightness of his choice. He must, to a certain extent, make a leap in the dark. Sometimes it is not until after decision and self-commitment that a vocation becomes clearer and more certain. God wills the just to live by faith, in other words, often by decisions that are more or less blind, and not by sight, by logical reasoning, by objective criteria or by miraculous visions. If God grants these things, we must bless Him for them, but they are not necessary for the response to a vocation. This act of faith and this decision, which sometimes have to be made without evidence or insight, are not, however, unmotivated acts or a sort of wager. The act of faith, the response to a vocation, the decision for a way of life or the choice of a ministry are founded on the Word of God, read and meditated upon in a spirit of prayer. Thus the assurance given by Christ in the Gospel that celibates for the kingdom of heaven’s sake are following his example and are in communion with his manhood, and the assertions of St Paul concerning the value of celibacy for the ministry, will be supports on which faith and decision can be solidly based.”
 
Before making public commitments to lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom, did I still have doubt? Absolutely! I wished my time of discernment had been marked by an even deeper sense of closeness to God so that I could be even more confident that I was hearing clearly. I wondered whether my sexuality or the ways the unhealthy practice of marriage in cultural Christianity have wounded me clouded by judgement. Perhaps I could faithfully do the kingdom work God has called me to while raising children with a wife. Admittedly, I had dated women and knew that would be good. God even seemed to bless marriage for me. Most of my friends and family were confident in my call to celibacy, but there were still some who hoped I would get married instead—maybe God was trying to speak through them in some way? There were plenty of reasons to doubt. But as Thurian predicted, my vocation became clearer and more certain after my decision and self-commitment. My appreciation for the vocation of marriage and the beauty of raising children has grown, just as my appreciation for my own vocation has grown. I’m increasingly confident that even if I weren’t gay, God would have called me to vocational singleness. With each passing year, it becomes more difficult to imagine dividing my energies between raising children and the ministry work I’ve been called to without one or both suffering. When I share with new friends about my story, my discernment, and my calling, they continue to affirm my calling. In the words of Thurian, my decision may have been to some extent blind, wanting for more logical reasoning, lacking in miraculous visions, but that act of faith has led to an inner peace demonstrated by less fear, less anger, less sadness, and increasing joy.
 
Thurian, 87






Public commitments help family/friends take our commitments more seriously, leading to better support

Plus, public commitments strengthen the confidence and joy of the discerner
Public Commitments

[Notes]
When the Nashville Family of Brothers was first developing, my pastor encouraged us to make our first commitment publicly.

Why? Because he knew that our families and friends needed to see us making this commitment so that they would take our vocations more seriously. He knew that they would realize the weight of our commitments and our need for support from them in the coming months and years. And he knew that we needed a public celebration for the joy and weight of the commitments to settle in for us. Man was he correct.

In front of friends and family, held up by four community pastors, I began my formal discernment process with the Nashville Family of Brothers, and I couldn’t get through the first sentence of my promises without falling apart in tears. I cried because, in that moment, I was showing the people in that sanctuary the deepest desires of my heart; I was letting my heart publicly begin to hope for family, and the tender part of my heart found that beautiful and terrifying. I couldn’t get through the first sentence: “I hope that God has called me to family with the men discerning the Nashville Family of Brothers.” Part of my tears was fear of letting my heart grow to expect God will grant me this family. I’m terrified to hope only to be let down again. But that fear was overwhelmed by joy and hope seen in my tears. After all of the work over the past decade battling to find answers, enduring spiritual abuse and abandonment, and seeing myself injured and others wiped out by spiritual warfare, I finally made it. As I saw my future brothers in the audience, heard another brother make the same promises, and multiple pastors laid their hands on me to pray for this endeavor, the boy inside of me finally felt like it was safe to step out of the armor and hope.

If you’re like me, you need family, but you’re afraid to expect to find it. It seems safer to learn to be satisfied with your current loneliness. I’m still scared. There’s no guarantee that this is God’s will or that the wills of men will cooperate. But I have to believe that the desire for family—a desire that God put into me—is good. I have to believe that I will do so much more for God’s kingdom if I find family. I have to believe that God didn’t just make me to fight, and that it will soon be safe to love.






Can gay people genuinely discern if they feel like they only have one option?

Are their negative effects of defaulting to celibacy (perpetual temporary singleness)?
LGBT+ Discernment

[Notes]
Is a life of singleness a response to unwanted SSA or a call separate from that?
Do gay people really need to discern? What are the consequences of Side B gay people defaulting to celibacy?
What about the other two categories of eunuchs?
Is one of the reasons you run this class to normalize discernment between Singleness & marriage and thereby help sexual minorities?

If we’re going to ask straight people to discern, gay people have got to discern
At least theologically open to it, recognize emotional barriers, ask for God to provide indifference, and seek God’s wisdom

If we don’t, we don’t own our decision
Aren’t all-in
Don’t take responsibility for thriving
And bail when it gets to hard because it wasn’t our choice anyway

Challenges of never-ending temporary singleness same for gay people as they are for straight people: shallowly rooted in spiritual family and kingdom work, DON’T HAVE THE GIFT

Thurian says it this way: “...the circumstances of life can be signs of the vocation of God. The Lord, who directs all things by his providence, can show a man in his life history his intention of calling him to celibacy. St Paul recalls the meaning of a person’s past history when he writes to the Corinthians...(1 Cor 7:17-24). The apostle does not, of course, make past history into a determinism...But he sees in past life and in present circumstances, in the state or the condition assigned to each man, a result of the providence of God and a way of being led to hear the call of God and of serving him.”







A Cautionary Tale
In 1 Tim 5:5-15 Paul condemns celibates who hastily discerned their vocation

Better to keep their first commitment, but breaking vow is lesser of two evils compared to reckless stewardship

[Notes]
Cautionary Tale
 
1 Timothy 5 describes a house of widows and the commitments to celibacy women have made. Remember that in Acts chapter 6, one of the first actions the newly formed Church took was to provide for the many single women who had become widows when their former husbands became Christians and divorced all of their wives but one. The Church saw it as their responsibility to provide housing, physical protection, sustenance, and opportunities to participate in the work of the Church. In 1 Corinthians 7:40 we hear Paul’s encouragement for these single women: “Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is.” Namely, to remain single and commit to vocational singleness. In 1 Timothy 5, then, we hear Paul’s judgment of widows who hastily discerned their call to vocational singleness, made a commitment to this house of widows, and then sought to be freed from their commitment. In verses 5 through 10 Paul describes model conduct for widows, including trusting God, faithfulness to her former husband, a track record of carrying for children, hospitality, etc. Then Paul suggests some new conditions for entrance into this community, most notably, that women be over 60 years old. Why? Because as Paul describes in verses 11-15, younger widows have been known to practice poor discernment of their calling, pledge celibacy without fully committing themselves to the vocation, allowing their sexual desires to overwhelm them, gossiping among the widows, breaking their pledge, and—in some cases—leaving the faith entirely. In light of these pattern among younger widows, he provides a practical suggestion for this specific community to refuse younger widows, and he gives the younger widows an allowance to break their first commitments to vocational singleness and marry.
 
A cursory reading of 1 Timothy 5 might suggest that only older Christians should commit to vocational singleness once they have no other options and that those committed to vocational singleness can break their commitment at any time without consequence. Quite the contrary. Paul encouragement for all Christians to consider vocational singleness has been made clear already. Nor does he give this allowance to break their first commitments lightly. This story is primarily a caution against poor discernment. Paul offers these two practical suggestions reluctantly because young widows have poorly discerned their vocation, failed to keep their vow, and committed serious sin by breaking their vow. It would have better for them to have first discerned marriage or kept their vow to a vocation of celibacy. 
 
Paul is commending that God’s best for those who have made a vow to marriage or celibacy is for them to keep their vow. Not doing so is a serious sin. Even if you married the wrong person, weren’t called to marriage at all, or weren’t called to celibacy. It is still serious sin. Will some of you remedy that by breaking your vow and sinning? Yes. I wish you wouldn’t, but I know some of you have been so reckless and careless in making your vows that there might be less sin by breaking your vows and living how God actually called you rather than honoring your vows. But, God would rather you honor your vows and fully commit yourself to walking them out faithfully.
 
St. Augustine confirms this understanding of 1 Timothy 5 when he says the following: “Once these and other vows have been pronounced, when they are made in the regular forms, they may on no condition be broken, because the resolution was made unconditionally. This is a commandment of the Lord; these words enable us to understand it: ‘Make your vows to the Lord your God, and perform them’ (Ps. 76:11). The apostle derives from this his judgement on some women who, having previously made a vow of continence, afterwards wish to marry, although they were perfectly free to marry before their vow; ‘They incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge’ (1 Tim 5:12).” Augustine makes clear that commitments to vocational singleness are meant to be kept, and breaking those commitments are a sin. Yet he recognizes that before their commitment, they were free to marry. What could have prevented these circumstances? Better discernment.
 
Why is it so important that we avoid poor discernment? Because the results can be painful. One of my closest friends married a man who failed to share his half-hearted commitment to marriage. Once the standard hardships of marriage and raising children set in, he started searching for a way out. He convinced himself that he married my friend under false pretenses, so it was okay in the eyes of God to get divorced. My friend resisted the request for divorce for years, but eventually she was compelled to comply. Today, her ex-husband is no longer a Christian, and she raises their two children alone. She loves her children, but she speaks honestly about her wish that she had discerned more carefully and never married her husband. She admits that she wanted to be married, and she married the first man who would say yes. By no means does she think her current hardship is some punishment for her poor discernment. But she will urge anyone considering marriage or committing to vocational singleness to discern carefully. If you don’t, the painful consequences can last a lifetime.

I can support you in preparing for a multi-meeting series sharing about God's wisdom and love on these topics (and your confessions on behalf of the Church and commitments to queer people inside and outside of your community).

I'd suggest recording this, and then having a *brief and vague* statement on the website that then links to the recording (so that people can't grab quotes easily).

Then, I can support you in writing a script for how you want to respond over email or in-person conversations when students ask specific questions related to the message.

I'd suggest providing a transition period for existing leaders where you ask them to lean into these conversations over the next year, with the understanding that they will be held to these new expectations starting fall 2022. But, I'd encourage you to start holding new leaders to these expectations in fall 2021.







Recognize the sins of the Church
Commit to doing better + take practical steps

Generally, how can we offer a winsome witness on these topics in progressive environments? We can recognize the sins of the Church, commit to doing better, take practical steps, offer clarity as a form of charity, cultivate thriving in the lives of Side B gay Christians, and call straight people to a high standard of sexual stewardship and to consider vocational singleness.
