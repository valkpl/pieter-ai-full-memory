God-honoring Sexuality:

MANY STORIES.
ONE NARRATIVE.




[Notes]
God created us as sexual people 
Beautiful when enjoyed in contexts that God has blessed 
Destructive when engaged in outside of those contexts 
If God is truly the Lord of our life, we will seek to honor him with our sexuality 

But as many of you know, we don’t all have the same story or the same challenges 
There is a diversity of experiences in the Body of Christ 
One set of stories that get a lot of attention more broadly in our culture but we still don’t talk about much are those who experience same-sex attraction 

Part of the hesitation has been that it seems like the ways we talk about sexual stewardship for most people and the mentoring skills we use with most people don’t seem to apply with those who experience same-sex attraction 
If we need a different set of skills and a separate conversation or sex-talk-night for the youth group for every difference story, that’s just too much 




Training Goal
To discover one narrative for God-honoring sexual stewardship that sufficiently speaks to the many stories among your youth, including those who experience same-sex attraction
To equip you with the understanding and skills to minister to those who experience same-sex attraction






Training Objectives
Deep Knowledge: Development of SSA, God’s Part, & Change
Strong Foundation: Complex + Compassionate Theology of Intimacy & Sexuality
Compassionate Response: How to Minister
