We Help You Make a Plan
Equip is an extension of your team
Pastors try to speak carefully about LGBT+ topics according to a historic sexual ethic, but conversations about these topics are fraught with landmines. How can you help everyone in your church thrive according to God’s good and weighty wisdom?
The Equip team leverages decades of personal and professional experience to walk step by step with church leaders, anticipate risks, develop a careful strategy customized for your church, and get real results through a long-lasting partnership. In addition to equipping Christian leaders to better care for gay people according to a historic sexual ethic and teach everyone about God’s love and wisdom for gay people, Equip takes it a step further. We help churches prevent the wounds of the closet, raise the bar for everyone’s sexual stewardship, and ensure that vocational singles find lifelong family, not loneliness. How? Through our signature
Blueprint Process.

Pricing
The cost of Equip’s Blueprint Process is $8,000 plus travel. Thanks to financial contributions from Equip supporters, the Blueprint Process is priced at only 50% of its actual cost compared to peer ministries.
When your church commits to implementing your Blueprint, Equip will commit to providing ongoing consulting, training, and support for free—a $60,000 value over 5 years and an estimated 100+ hours. We fundraise so that money is never a barrier to churches investing the time and energy necessary to become churches where gay people thrive with reasonable effort according to historic sexual ethics.
If the Blueprint Process price-point is out of reach for your church, please contact us about additional scholarships provided thanks to financial supporters of Equip.

Equip went far beyond simple platitudes or quick fixes. Instead we encountered a wholistic approach to thinking and then responding well from a posture of both orthodoxy and empathy when it comes to sexual identity and sexual ethics. We were challenged to think more broadly and deeply about the foggy and often inconsistent ways that these ideas have been typically discussed.

Equip is uniquely situated to be a voice for biblical fidelity in matters of Christian faith, church, and human sexuality. Pieter has often helped me understand the challenges of human sexuality and the possibilities for all of us to submit our sexualities to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

“
There are precious few resources for gay Christians who want to live within traditional Christian sexual ethics. Equip is one of those few, and its many perspectives on celibacy, in particular, and how our churches need to devote much more loving attention to the question of how best to support and honor celibacy as a time-honored Christian calling are invaluable.
“
Rev. Dr. Wesley Hill
Author of Washed and Waiting: Reflections on Christian Faithfulness and Homosexuality
“
The expertise, personal attention, and theological acuity of Pieter and the Equip team are truly priceless. Their expertise, personal attention, and theological acuity are truly priceless. Their continued posture of learning, along with a multi-generational, holistic vision for the local church, give me hope for our future. I wholeheartedly encourage every local church to partner with Equip’s work.
