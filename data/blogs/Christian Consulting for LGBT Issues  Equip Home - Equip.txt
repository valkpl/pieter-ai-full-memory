We help your church become a place where LGBT+ people embrace and thrive according to historic sexual ethics.
See how
Through long-term partnerships that leads to long-lasting results, your church can prevent the wounds of the closet, raise the bar for sexual stewardship, and ensure that vocational singles find lifelong family, not loneliness.
What’s the challenge?
Parents of gay* kids are asking pastors like you for help. Maybe you feel overwhelmed and alone—afraid to say or do the wrong thing but pressured from all sides to take action.
Pastors are spread thin across many priorities but still need more expertise to confidently lead these important conversations. Equip is here to carry some of that burden as you do the hard work of educating your congregation about sexuality and caring for each family’s needs individually.
*We use a range of vocabulary to reach non-Christian teens and young adults with the gospel. Learn why

Testimonials
“
Equip went far beyond simple platitudes or quick fixes. Instead we encountered a wholistic approach to thinking and then responding well from a posture of both orthodoxy and empathy when it comes to sexual identity and sexual ethics. We were challenged to think more broadly and deeply about the foggy and often inconsistent ways that these ideas have been typically discussed.
“
Jason Pagel
Teaching Minister, Harpeth Hills Church of Christ, Nashville, TN
“
The work Pieter and his team are doing at Equip comes from a place of theological soundness, therapeutic wisdom, and lived experience. Their work is worth exploring!
“
Laurie Krieg
Speaker & Author of An Impossible Marriage
“
Equip is uniquely situated to be a voice for biblical fidelity in matters of Christian faith, church, and human sexuality. Pieter has often helped me understand the challenges of human sexuality and the possibilities for all of us to submit our sexualities to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
“
Rt. Rev. Dr. Todd Hunter
Bishop of the Anglican Churches for the Sake of Others & Author of Deep Peace: Finding Calm in a World of Conflict and Anxiety
“
There are precious few resources for gay Christians who want to live within traditional Christian sexual ethics. Equip is one of those few, and its many perspectives on celibacy, in particular, and how our churches need to devote much more loving attention to the question of how best to support and honor celibacy as a time-honored Christian calling are invaluable.
“
Rev. Dr. Wesley Hill
Author of Washed and Waiting: Reflections on Christian Faithfulness and Homosexuality
“
The expertise, personal attention, and theological acuity of Pieter and the Equip team are truly priceless. Their expertise, personal attention, and theological acuity are truly priceless. Their continued posture of learning, along with a multi-generational, holistic vision for the local church, give me hope for our future. I wholeheartedly encourage every local church to partner with Equip’s work.
“
Dr. Yucan Chiu
Pastor & Director of the Ethnos Network
“

“
Rev. Dr. Greg Peters
Professor at Biola University and Nashotah House Theological Seminary
“
Equip is an essential resource for Christian parents, ministers, and lay people alike. I recommend it to clients, friends, and family and am so grateful for the work Equip is doing for the body of Christ!
