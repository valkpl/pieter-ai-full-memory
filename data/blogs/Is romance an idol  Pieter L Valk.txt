On Valentine's Day I joined the Boston Fellows to explore how God's call to vocational singleness challenges the idol of romance in our cities and churches.

We defined an idol as a God substitute that tempts us with false promises
(1) to serve our own desires,
(2) disobey God’s wisdom, and
(3) take what only God can provide
Then we defined romance as an emotional desire for sensual love with another person AND the courtship behaviors undertaken by an individual to express those feelings on a trajectory of erotic love.
Combining these, we described that the idol of romance (1) promises pleasure and escape from loneliness, (2) tempts us to take what we want, and (3) costs us abortion, divorce, adultery, casual connection, and codependency.
In contrast, the Scriptures say God wants to give us a good gift of either vocational singleness or Christian marriage, and we should seek His preference through discernment.
Instead of taking what we want, we can open-handedly seek from God which He knows would be personally better for each of us.
What do you think of this definition of romance?
Do you think romance is an idol in our churches?
What do you think God's solution is?
