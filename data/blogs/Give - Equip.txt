Our Mission
Equip is the premier consulting and training solution for churches aspiring to be places where gay Christians thrive for a lifetime according to a traditional sexual ethic.
Sponsor one time training
Provide a one-time training to Christian leaders at a church, campus ministry, or Christian university to transform their community into a place where gay people thrive in a traditional sexual ethic.
Give $50 a Month
Sponsor monthly pastor coaching
Many pastors feel alone and under-resourced. Support our free monthly coaching to prepare pastors with the understanding and tools to better minister to gay people in their communities.
Give $100 a Month
Sponsor church Blueprint
Using our Blueprint Process, your gift will help local churches identify the needs of their community, cast a vision for life-giving ministry to LGBT+, and develop a careful strategy to become a thriving community.
Give $500 a Month
