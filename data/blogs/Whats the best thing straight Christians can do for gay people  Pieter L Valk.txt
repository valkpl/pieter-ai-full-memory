As an alumnus of the Boston Fellows, I cherish opportunities to speak to Fellows Programs about my story and work.
Unfortunately, it was virtual due to the SNOWPOCALYPSE in Nashville :(
I shared with the Nashville Fellows about my story, what I believe (and why), how God has called me to steward my sexuality, and how churches can better love gay people according to God's wisdom.
Then we got to our big question: What is the most impactful thing straight Christians can do for gay people?
My answer: Give God a chance to call you to vocational singleness.
Our churches will not become places where gay Christians can thrive in vocational singleness until 10% of straight Christians accept their call to vocational singleness.
If 10% of straight Christians were walking out vocational singleness, our numbers would finally compel churches to teach about our calling and support us in structural ways.
If you're a straight Christian, you really love gay people, you see our pain, and you wish someone did something about it: Please offer the question of marriage or vocational singleness to God.
Instead of assuming God has marriage for you and plowing head with plans to take marriage, would you pause and open-handedly seek God's preference?
