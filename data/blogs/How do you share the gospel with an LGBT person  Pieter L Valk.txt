In the same way you share the gospel with anyone else!
LGBT+ people don’t need a different type of gospel or a different type of Jesus.
Sometimes people respond, "Well, I guess I honestly don't know how to share the gospel with anyone unless the Holy Spirit has kind of teed me up for an easy home-run."
There's no best way to share the gospel, but here's what I've noticed:
Honestly, outside of a powerful movement of the Holy Spirit, if their life is comfortable and seemingly fulfilled without knowing Jesus, then it might not be the right timing.
So develop friendship with them such that if they reach a point in life when they're deeply pained or unfulfilled and starting to ask big questions about how to make sense of the world and how to find meaning, you're one of the people in their life that they actually want to bring those questions to.
Then in the meantime, lean into family in the body of Christ and collaborate with Jesus to bring the kingdom to the poor and needy in your city, so your friends actually see Jesus in your life!
