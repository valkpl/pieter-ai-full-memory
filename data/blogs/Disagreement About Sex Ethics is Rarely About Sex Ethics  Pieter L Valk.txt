I recently went on the Good Christian Co. Podcast with Robby Ortiz and Joshua Delp to talk about faith and sexuality.
At one point, they asked me how to navigate conversations where people disagree about the morality of gay marriage and gay sex.
My solution: Don't talk about sexual ethics.
Instead, talk about more fundamental theological questions.
Most of the time, if I've come to a different conclusion than someone else regarding sexual ethics, it's merely a downstream result of disagreement on one of three much more important theological questions:
1. Is there a God?
2. Does that God know what's best for me better than I do?
3. Do we discover that God's best for us by reading the Bible with the historic Church?
Two people seldom answer "yes" to all three of those questions yet hold meaningfully different opinions about sexual ethics.
So if you do disagree, avoid emotionally-loaded and seemingly high-stakes conversation about sexual ethics.
Instead, talk about whether there's a God, whether that God know's what's best, and how we discover what that God's best is!
