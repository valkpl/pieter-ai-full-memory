Review of Todd Hunter’s “Deep Peace”
Reflection

I finished Bp Todd's latest book on a cruise in the Pacific while planning my spiritual disciplines for the new year. "Deep Peace" is packed with wisdom, and I particularly appreciated musings on peacefully loving our enemies.
Hunter defines peace as contentment and confidence in God's faithfulness that enables loving engagement with others, particularly our enemies.
How can we be peacemakers in a culturally, politically divided world? Be filled with the love of God so much that we can't help but love our enemies!
Yes, Jesus flipped the tables of enemies of peace, but he also died for them.
If we're serious about imitating Jesus, we have to assume the best intentions of those we disagree with and seek to understand their perspective. We have to give our enemies the benefit of the doubt over and over again.
We can seek to change the minds of those we disagree with, but we have to do so with genuine love for them, not a desire to publicly defeat and humiliate them.
How, then, can I cultivate this love of God that is so great that I can't help but love my enemies?
"Deep Peace" helped me recommit to times of silence, practices of noticing good and beautiful things in my life, and short prayers that encourage my heart and mind to seek peace.
Plus I took an inventory of everyday activities that seem to bring me peace: playing with my godson and his sister, doing yardwork, going on a run, cooking, listening to jazz or classical music, and eating good food with friends.
I pray 2022 is filled with peace-seeking practices.
Bp Todd, thanks for this book and your wisdom for the Church!
