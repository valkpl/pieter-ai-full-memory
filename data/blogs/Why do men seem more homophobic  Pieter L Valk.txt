Check out the answer to this question and more on the latest episode of the Kent Lapp Podcast:
When someone makes a joke about close friendship between two men, some men feel the need to prove that they aren't gay by responding strongly.
Cruelty toward gay people—homophobia—is one way to "prove" that.
Perhaps men are more homophobic, in part, because they police each others' friendship more than women do.
Why? Maybe men are afraid of healthy friendship and our own emotions.
