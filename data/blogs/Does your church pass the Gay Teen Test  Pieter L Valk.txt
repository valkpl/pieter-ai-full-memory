Jeremy Jenkins had me on the All Things All People Podcast to talk about the Gay Teen Test.
EQUIP developed this 5-question assessment to help leaders measure if their churches are places where gay teens will embrace God's love and wisdom for sexuality.
Here's the Gay Teen Test (briefly):
1️⃣ Is your church a place where everyone is thinking theologically about their sexual stewardship?
2️⃣ Does your church talk publicly about the challenges LGBT+ Christians face so that they know it’s safe?
3️⃣ Does your church make sure every child knows that God loves gay people and has good plans for them?
4️⃣ Do pastors and lay leaders in your church know how to minister to LGBT+ Christians well?
5️⃣ Is your church a place where LGBT+ people could thrive in celibacy or Christian marriage?
I'll be honest, I've yet to meet a church that scores higher than 2 out of 5 on EQUIP's Gay Teen Test.
That's why my full-time job is long-term partnership with churches to help them become places that score a 5 out of 5 by confident answering "Yes!" to each of those questions.
