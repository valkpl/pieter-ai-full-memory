After recent losses, I was reminded that (somehow) Christians who've died are watching and hoping for God's goodness and beauty in our lives here on earth. Icons are a visible and comforting reminder of their hopeful watching.Yall have heard me rave about Max Thurian before. He helped start the Taize Community in France (the largest ecumenical Christian monastery in the world) and the author of my #1 book on vocational singleness: Marriage and Celibacy.Imagine a seminary professor asked a brilliant student to write a brief argument for historical teachings about Christian celibacy, but he's not allowed to appeal to tradition. He can only use evidence from Scripture. That’s this book.His theology and his community were a significant inspiration for the Nashville Family of Brothers, so I commissioned Tony Esser to write this icon for us.The icon shows the connection between Tennessee and France (where Taize is). The boat with a cross in it is a common symbol for Christian ecumenism.The Anglo-Catholic flag in the top left hints at Thurian's conversion from Anglicanism to Catholicism. I identify as Anglo-Catholic, although on the Anglican side.And of course, he's holding and pointing to "Marriage and Celibacy".I'm grateful for comforting glances from Max Thurian when I see his icon from across the room. Tony, thanks for blessing the Nashville Family of Brothers!P.S. It's difficult to find a copy of "Marriage and Celibacy", but I have a pdf copy and some loaner physical copies. Comment if you're interested in me sending you either!
