Check out the Jubilee Freedom Shalom Podcast episode titled "Gay, Straight, Married, Single, Sex, and Jesus" where we discussed my Christianity Today article about discernment and vocational singleness.
We asked, "WHY should a Christian PAUSE and ask God if He has a preference?"
The answer: GIFT
Jesus and Paul use the word give/gift in Matthew 19 and 1 Corinthians 7. These words suggest that
1️⃣ we NEED something and
2️⃣ there's a GIVER
First, we should discern because we NEED something: a gift of grace. Lifetime singleness for the kingdom is difficult. Scripture promises help from God, a gift of grace, to thrive in vocational singleness.
At the same time, Christian marrieds raising children also feel like their kingdom work is IMPOSSIBLE without God's help. Scripture promises a gift of grace to thrive in Christian marriage.
Second, we should discern because there is a GIVER: God. Scripture says that God gives, not us. He CHOOSES whether He wants to offer the gift of vocational singleness or Christian marriage to each of us.
Discernment leads us to discovering God's preference.
For each of us, God has imagined whether vocational singleness or Christian marriage would PERSONALLY lead us to more goodness and bring God more glory.
If we want the life of most goodness, beauty, and PLEASURE, then we should trust God's wisdom.
