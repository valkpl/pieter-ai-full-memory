Parents, choose vocational singles as godparents
Vocational Singleness

Easter 2021 marked two years since Bentley was baptized and I became his godfather. Being a godfather has changed the way I love Bentley and see myself.
Normally when I hold a baby, I'm hesitant and afraid. I'm deeply aware that the child is not mine. I look to the parents for confirmation that I'm caring well.
But days after Hannah and Chase told me I'd be Bentley's godfather, I started noticing changes. Apprehension and fear were gone. I felt like Bentley was mine, in a small but meaningful way.
I was more comfortable being affectionate with Bentley. That same night his parents told me I'd be his godfather, I laid down on the couch and cuddled next to him.
Becoming a godfather has also changed how I se myself. Those of us called to vocational singleness often lack external motivations to take care of ourselves.
But being committed to my godson motivates me to lean into my sanctification for Bentley's sake. I want to be healthy so I can serve him well.
Parents, let me encourage you to intentionally choose celibate people to be godparents, particularly if they plan to live in close proximity long-term.
On a practical side, vocational singles often have more availability to help. Our commitments are more flexible.
We may also be more emotionally available. Because we don't have a spouse or our own children, our godchildren and their parents can occupy higher-priority spots in our hearts.
Plus, vocational singles need it more. Becoming a godparent grafted me into another family. It honored the availability of my vocation by providing me with a concrete opportunity to be a spiritual parent.
Hannah and Chase, thank you! Bentley, I love you!
