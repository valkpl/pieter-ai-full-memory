Our Mission
Equip is a premier consulting and training solution for churches aspiring to be places where LGBT+ people embrace and thrive according to historic sexual ethics.
See our mission in action
Vision
In addition to equipping Christian leaders to better care for gay people according to a historic sexual ethic and teach everyone about God’s love and wisdom for gay people, Equip takes it a step further…
Read more
We help churches prevent the wounds of the closet, raise the bar for everyone’s sexual stewardship, and ensure that vocational singles find lifelong family, not loneliness. We yearn for the Church to become a place where children hear their parents and pastors talk about same-sex attraction in theologically accurate and compassionate ways. So that when, in late elementary school or early middle school, some children realize they are attracted to other boys and girls of the same sex, they no longer respond with shame, fear, or hiding. Instead, we desire for them to share with their parents and pastors because they have heard that God still loves them and has good things for them. We help everyone in your church thrive according to God’s good and weighty wisdom. We do this through long-term partnerships that lead to long-lasting results, beginning with our signature Blueprint Process to identify a vision and strategy customized for your church.

Beliefs
God has revealed His wisdom for every person’s sexual stewardship through the Church and the Scriptures, including God’s good and weighty wisdom for gay* people…
Read more
God calls the Church to love and serve those who experience same-sex attraction regardless of what their journeys look like.
God loves LGBT+ people and values the gifts, talents, and fellowship they can offer the Body of Christ.
God promises a lifetime of sanctification and provision of fullness through Christ to all who seek Him faithfully.
People do not choose who they are attracted to, but they do choose how they respond. While we affirm and teach from a historic sexual ethic, we respect all people’s right to follow their own paths.
Equip does not promise change in a person’s same-sex attraction. Equip does not advocate for reparative therapy or sexual orientation change therapy. Learn more about our perspective on “pray the gay away” practices inside churches and counseling centers

Statement of Faith

Meet the Staff
Pieter Valk, LPC
Executive Director
Pieter established Equip in 2014. He’s a writer and speaker about discernment, vocational singleness, and LGBT+ topics according to a historic sexual ethic published in places like
Christianity
Today
and
Mere
Orthodoxy
. Pieter is a teacher and aspiring deacon in the Anglican Church in North America about celibacy and sexuality. He is a founding brother of the Nashville Family of Brothers, an ecumenical monastery building lifelong family for men called to vocational singleness. Pieter is a licensed professional counselor and  specializes in serving gay Christians hoping to steward their sexualities according to a historic sexual ethic. He graduated with Highest Honors in Chemistry from Vanderbilt University, studied at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and earned a Master’s in Clinical Mental Health Counseling at Lipscomb University.

Amber Carroll
Vice President of Impact and Parent Resources
Amber joined Equip in 2019. She leads the prayer team, manages volunteer opportunities, and teaches parents of young kids how to talk to their kids about sex and sexuality, marriage and singleness, intimacy and family, and gender and gender incongruence. She’s the creator of  Equip’s
Parent Course,
an on-demand resource designed to help parents and caregivers of all types have conversations with kids about God’s wisdom for sexual stewardship.
She graduated from Union University in 2008 with a BA in English Literature and Secondary Education. After graduation, Amber taught middle and high school in the public school system for six years then spent five years raising children and freelance editing before joining Equip.
This work matters to Amber because her ex-husband is gay, and she’s seen firsthand some of the ways the Church didn’t offer the things he needed to thrive in his faith. Amber also has two young kids, and if one of them happens to be LGBT+, she wants them to grow up hearing from the Church that God loves LGBT+ people and has good things for them.
