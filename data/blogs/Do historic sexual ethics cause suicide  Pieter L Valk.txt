The short answer: No, and there's scientific evidence to prove it.
Scientific studies have found
that participation in sexual orientation changes efforts nearly doubles your risk of suicide (increases by 92%).
So pray-the-gay-away theology does cause suicide.
On the other extreme, while a revisionist sexual ethic may not commonly lead to suicide,
I've explored before
how it often leads to deconstruction and abandoning one's faith.
That is a death of another kind.
Then in the middle of these two extremes, how does
a compassionate embodiment of historic sexual ethics
impact mental and spiritual health?
Research by Olya Zaporozhet and Mark Yarhouse published in 2019
found that gay celibate Christians scored in the normal range of mental health compared to the average American.
But then gay celibate Christians scored higher than average overall life satisfaction.
While limited, this evidence suggests that a compassionate historic sexual ethic promotes mental and spiritual health, unlike theological extremes in each direction.
So, if your primary concern is the health of kids and teens, don't be fooled into thinking you must abandon God's wisdom or compassion.
Embrace both, and take practical steps to help children in your church steward their sexualities in God-honoring and life-giving ways!
