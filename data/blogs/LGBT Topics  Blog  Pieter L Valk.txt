From Pray-the-Gay-Away to Pansexual Pragmatism
Over the past decade the number of people who identify as LGBT+ has doubled, particularly among those who identify as pansexual and are opening to choosing a life partner based on something other than greatest physical attraction. Yet over the same time span, the son of conversion therapy creator Joseph Nicolosi Sr. has created and popularized a new conversion therapy call "reintegrative therapy" for gay people trying to get straight married. What do we do with these seemingly parallel but also contradictory trends?

‚ÄúA Better Trans Conversation‚Äù in Christianity Today
As the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on youth gender medicine, Christians must prepare to speak with love while holding fast to biblical truth.

A brief explainer of my views on biblical gender ethics
Christian leaders need to first prioritize relationship with trans people, build trust, address any mental health challenges unrelated to gender incongruence, and patiently wait for the Holy Spirit to move. But eventually, conversation may get to theological questions. Even more often, cisgender straight Christians press me to answer the question, ‚ÄúIs transition permissible for Christians navigating gender incongruence?‚Äù How do I answer that question and others?

Beware of the New Ex-Gay
The ex-gay movement seemingly died in the 2010s. Exodus International (the umbrella organization of sexual orientation change effort "SOCE" ministries) closed in 2013, admitting that "99.9% of [participants] have not experienced a change in their orientation." By the end of the 2010s, it seemed that evangelical Christians had widely accepted that people don't choose who they're attracted to, SOCEs were harmfully ineffective, and a different solution was needed. But over the past few years, the ex-gay movement appears to be making a comeback.

‚ÄúAn Orthodox Challenge to Systemic Homophobia‚Äù in The Living Church
Have you sensed a tension between racial justice and biblical justice for gay people? In my latest article in The Living Church, I explore how Christians can use the concepts of systemic racism and biblical racial justice to think about biblical justice for sexual minorities.

What if a same-sex couple with kids converts?
Pastors and Christian leaders often ask me what seems like a bit of a sensationalist ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù question: They ask, ‚ÄúWhat if a same-sex married couple with kids starts coming to your church, all of them become Christians, and the couple both become convinced of historic sexual ethics? What do they do next?‚Äù

Is internalized homophobia holding you back?
People on the left who disagree with gay Christians like me (who hold a historic sexual ethic) often accuse us of internalized homophobia. While they intend to discredit our beliefs with this accusation‚Äîsuggesting we're only committed to God's wisdom because of deep-seated shame, they're right (in part). I've definitely been haunted by internalized homophobia...

What does it mean to be pansexual?
Do any of your friends identify as pansexual? Over the past year, I've increasingly noticed teens, celebrities, and some Christians identifying as pan or pansexual. I've read the internet definitions, and as someone who teaches about sexuality for a living I'm supposed to know what it means to be pan, with precision. But I'm gonna be honest. I feel a little lost.

‚ÄúUnpacking the Closet: How Inside Out 2 Resurfaced my Trauma‚Äù in Christ & Pop
I have a confession. I‚Äôm a Licensed Professional Counselor, but until two days before seeing Inside Out 2, I still hadn‚Äôt even seen the first Inside Out. I know. Malpractice. Despite the hype, Inside Out met and exceeded my expectations...

Yes, Rosaria, Christians do have LGBT+ neighbors...
In a recent article on Clear Truth Media, Rosaria Butterfield argues that none of us have LGBT+/queer neighbors because LGBT+ people do not exist. She goes on to explain that God did not intend for anyone to be queer (no one is ontologically a sexual or gender minority); therefore a Christian who concedes to their neighbor being an LGBT+ person is complicit in a lie that will lead them further away from Jesus. So, what did Rosaria Butterfield get right (and wrong) in her recent article about sexual orientation and ontology?

The closet created my sex addiction.
I recently shared about my ongoing sexual addiction recovery. And I‚Äôve posted in the past about the fact that same-sex attraction does not inherently lead to sexual addiction. But it‚Äôs true that gay people struggle with sexual addiction at higher rates than some other populations. Why? The closet.

Coming Out as Celibate (to my Gay Hairstylist)
Nervous about sharing your beliefs on sex ethics outside of church?! I was, and then a TikTok notification made it unavoidable. This is how I faced my fears. üò¨
‚ÄúA year ago when I downloaded Tiktok, I enabled a feature that allows you to see who's viewed your Tiktok profile (and vice versa)‚Ä¶‚Äù

Where have I experienced ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù in my sexuality?
I recently went on the Head to Heart Podcast with Jenny Marcum, and she opened with a question she asks many of her guests: What has Jesus freed you from? If I‚Äôm honest, hearing the question brought back painful memories. As a gay Christian committed to historic sex ethics, I‚Äôve often been asked why God hasn‚Äôt yet freed me from my same-sex attractions.

Don‚Äôt worry..God has a beautiful plan for your life‚Ä¶
You may have seen this demotivational poster of St. Sebastian in the background of one of my recent videos. I read about something similar in Eve Tushnet‚Äôs book ‚ÄúTenderness‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt resist designing and printing a version for myself. The sarcasm and double meaning are deeply satisfying.

Wait, gay sex isn't a salvation issue?!
I recently posted a video sharing why I think God's wisdom for our sexualities is worth following (Proverbs 4:6-7, Matthew 7:24-25). I made a passing comment at the start of the video that I don't believe gay sex is a salvation issue. Some were surprised, so I wanted to explain.

If it‚Äôs not a salvation issue, why not just be with a man?
You guys know that I don‚Äôt think our beliefs or behavior around sexual ethics is a salvation issue. There are people I disagree with about gay marriage, gay romance, and gay sex who will be in heaven. I recently shared about that at a church. While the head pastor and I were later debriefing the training, he asked me an honest question: if it‚Äôs not a salvation issue, why not just be with a man? Why not have your cake and eat it too?

‚ÄúWhen Heavyweights Change their Minds‚Äù in Firebrand Magazine
A blurb recently appeared on the Yale University Press website for a new book by Dr. Richard Hays and his son (out Sept 2024) in which it seems he'll reveal his change to a revisionist sexual ethic. Like me, many Christians over the past few decades have read Hays's 1996 "Moral Vision of the New Testament" and referred back to his earlier work to justify our commitment to historic sexual ethics. When theological heavyweights like Hays change their minds, it's disorienting for many. For me, it led to a now all-too-familiar cycle of fear, disappointment, betrayal, and hop

Is giving up romance a sacrifice?
Some Christians are theologically convinced that gay romance/sex are sins, but deep down they still feel like people need romance to be happy. Deep down, it doesn‚Äôt feel fair that celibacy often seems like the only option God offers to gay people. Some earnestly wonder whether God is asking gay people to sacrifice more than other Christians and whether that‚Äôs good.

Why would an LGBT+ person ever want to attend my church?
Why would an lgbt+ person every want to attend my church? particularly if they're not a Christian and disagree with our sexual ethics? Honestly, that's a pretty universal question: Why would anyone want to be a part of a church that calls him or her to inconvenient stewardship of any kind?

How do you share the gospel with an LGBT+ person?
How do you share the gospel with an LGBT+ person? In the same way you share the gospel with anyone else! LGBT+ people don‚Äôt need a different type of gospel or a different type of Jesus. Sometimes people respond, "Well, I guess I honestly don't know how to share the gospel with anyone unless the Holy Spirit has kind of teed me up for an easy home-run." There's no best way to share the gospel, but here's what I've noticed‚Ä¶
