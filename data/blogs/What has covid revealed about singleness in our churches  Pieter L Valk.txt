I joined Lorinda Pretorius (a Christian Sexologist in South Africa and host of the Chasing Something Podcast) for a conversation about singleness and intimacy.
At one point, we explored how the pandemic has been particularly painful for single Christians and highlighted churches' decades-long struggle to offer single people family in the body of Christ.
Social distancing measures forced Christians to choose a limited number of people for their covid-bubbles. Many singles found themselves living alone and left out of church family covid-bubbles.
No amount of video calls could make up for the lack of in-person, physically-embodied relationship—reminding Christians why it's important that God gives us bodies in this life & the life to come.
Plus, being left out of church family covid-bubbles revealed revealed the cost of not being a priority: single Christians awakened to their need to be prioritized.
I pray single people don't forget our need for committed, in-person friendship. I pray we are willing to take culturally-inconvenient steps to find lifelong, lived-in human family with other Christians.
