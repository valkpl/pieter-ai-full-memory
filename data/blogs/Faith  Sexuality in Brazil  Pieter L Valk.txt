Thales Moura had me on the Conflictu Podcast for an international conversation about faith and sexuality.
(The introduction is in Portuguese but the main content is in English. They'll release a Portuguese-only version soon.)
We explored three big ways churches can better love gay people according to God's wisdom:
1) Equip parents to lead kids ages 2-12 in conversation about God-honoring sexuality for all people that makes it easier for gay kids to share with parents and never enter the closet
2) Help pastors help committed singles enjoy lifelong, lived-in family instead of being stuck in the revolving door of roommates
3) Train pastors and parents to teach about sexual stewardship for all people, consistently calling God's people to his high standard of faithfulness
EQUIP offers all of this to churches as part of a long-term, highly collaborative partnership driven by a vision and strategy customized for your church so that we can help your church achieve real, long-lasting results.

to hear more about how gay people can safely come out to biological family, how parents can respond compassionately, and how pastors can support families with gay loved ones.
