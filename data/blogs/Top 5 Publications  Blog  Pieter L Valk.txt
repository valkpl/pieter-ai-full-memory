Coming Out as Celibate (to my Gay Hairstylist)
Nervous about sharing your beliefs on sex ethics outside of church?! I was, and then a TikTok notification made it unavoidable. This is how I faced my fears. üò¨
‚ÄúA year ago when I downloaded Tiktok, I enabled a feature that allows you to see who's viewed your Tiktok profile (and vice versa)‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen Heavyweights Change their Minds‚Äù in Firebrand Magazine
A blurb recently appeared on the Yale University Press website for a new book by Dr. Richard Hays and his son (out Sept 2024) in which it seems he'll reveal his change to a revisionist sexual ethic. Like me, many Christians over the past few decades have read Hays's 1996 "Moral Vision of the New Testament" and referred back to his earlier work to justify our commitment to historic sexual ethics. When theological heavyweights like Hays change their minds, it's disorienting for many. For me, it led to a now all-too-familiar cycle of fear, disappointment, betrayal, and hop

The Ascetic Fetish
Christian celibacy is a tragically misunderstood concept. Depictions of kingdom singleness, from Renaissance paintings to modern television shows, often misrepresent Christ's invitation and early Church practices, tempting some ordinary Christians to ignore their calling and others to indulge in a caricature of the vocation of Jesus. These thoughts swirled through my mind as I took up an invitation to spend a holiday weekend at a friend‚Äôs house in the land of 1000 lakes‚Ä¶

How a Deconstructed Evangelical Found Reconstruction as an Anglican
Can God's wisdom be known? What should we do when God feels absent? I'm grateful for the opportunity to write for "The Living Church" in a more extended way about my evangelical deconstruction and Anglican reconstruction.

Netflix's "Pray Away": Beware of False Dichotomies
Netflix's "Pray Away" presents a false dichotomy between ex-gay theology and progressive sexual ethics, erasing gay celibate Christians who hold fast to Biblical wisdom while accepting that sexual orientation rarely changes.

Is it really better to marry than burn with desire?
From Fathom Magazine - Today, more Christian young adults are postponing marriage or considering never marrying than ever before, and the church at large fears plummeting marriage percentages and the declining birth rates that follow. As those numbers soften, their refrain booms louder: ‚ÄúIf abstinent singleness isn‚Äôt easy for you, don‚Äôt worry. Just get married.‚Äù Armed with 1 Corinthians 7:9, they plead with the under-thirty crowd, ‚ÄúPLEASE. Get married.‚Äù

Why say gay? A response to ‚ÄúYes to Gay Identity, No to Gay Sex?‚Äù
From Juicy Ecumenism - Won't people think I'm having gay sex? That God made me gay? Am I identifying with sin? Compromising my identity in Christ? I've finally written what I hope is the last explanation I'll ever have to give for why I call myself a gay Christian.

The Case for Vocational Singleness
From Christianity Today - How can our churches raise up more kingdom workers to heal our communities with undivided attention? Our churches need to become places where young adults genuinely discern whether God is calling them to vocational singleness or Christian marriage.

Can Anglicans in North America Offer Something Better Than Gay Marriage?
The congregations that would become the ACNA endured decades of TEC slowly (or not so slowly) abandoning orthodoxy on many fronts, but sexual ethics served as the breaking point. At least in the eyes of this cradle Anglican, a belief that God had something better to offer gay people than gay marriage was at the very center of the ACNA‚Äôs origins. Plus, many perceive the ACNA as the first major group to leave a mainline denomination over gay marriage. For these reasons, fulfilling our commitment to offering gay people a viable path for thriving according to God‚Äôs wisdom is central to our credibility. To put it simply, many people have been waiting to see if we meant what we promised or if we just didn‚Äôt like gay people.
