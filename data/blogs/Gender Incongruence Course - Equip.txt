About the Course
Course Objectives and Content
“Understanding Gender Incongruence & Caring for Trans* People” is a 4-session course that (1) helps Christian leaders and parents think empathetically and theologically about gender incongruence and (2) equips Christian leaders and parents to offer God’s love and wisdom to trans* people.
Session 1: Empathize with the stories of people navigating gender incongruence and ground conversation in shared terminology
Session 2: Examine passages of Scripture often cited in conversations about gender ethics and explore how Equip invites Christian leaders and pastors to think theologically about ministering to trans* people
Session 3: Survey alternate Christian and non-Christian perspectives on gender ethics and learn how you can better care for those navigating gender incongruence in your churches and families
Session 4: Learn how to care for kids and teens who share about incongruence and consider a series of case studies spanning a range of scenarios you might encounter
About Jesse White
Equip’s Gender Incongruence Content Specialist
Jesse began working with Equip in the fall of 2022. A graduate from the College at Southeastern in 2021 with a Bachelors in Global Studies, Jesse is currently working on a Master’s in Marriage and Family Counseling at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Once graduating with an LMFT, Jesse wants to focus on abuse and trauma therapy and then practice counseling as a missionary in Southeast Asia (hopefully Thailand or Cambodia).
Alongside working with Equip, Jesse started a support group for sexual and gender minorities at a local church and offered training and equipping opportunities to the broader congregation on how to better engage people outside the church who share these experiences.
Jesse is driven by a desire for other sexual and gender minorities to experience God’s love. Despite years of hurt and abuse from former churches, Jesse has undeniably seen God’s faithfulness through the church and wants to continue to better equip the church to care well for the hurting and broken.
Jesse’s preferred pronouns are he/they. To learn more about Jesse’s pronoun preference and why Equip practices pronoun hospitality, read
