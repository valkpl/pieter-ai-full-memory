Did Jesus talk about gay sex?
That's 1 of 9 arguments for gay-affirming theology I tackled in a seminar in 2020. Here's my summary of the most convincing arguments for a progressive sexual ethic:
1. Jesus didn’t talk about gay sex
2. Christians were wrong about slavery and women
3. God makes people gay
4. Celibacy shouldn’t be forced
5. Mixed-orientation marriages don’t work
6. Traditional sexual ethics bear bad fruit
7. A loving God wouldn’t deny a loving marriage
How would you respond?
