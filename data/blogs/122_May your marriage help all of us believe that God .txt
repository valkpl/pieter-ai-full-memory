Checkout this recording of a toast I gave for my brother and sister-in-law, praying that their marriage embodies and displays God’s mysterious love in ways that makes it easier for them and the people around tme to know God’s love. 



May the intimacy you share remind us that God wants to intimately love each one of us.When you raise kids, whether kids you give birth to or through foster or adoption, may we be reminded that Jesus lived and died so that we may have new life—that God’s love is life-giving and life-sustaining.May the differentness between the two of you as man and women remind each of us that there is a beautiful differentness between us and God.When you invite people outside of your nuclear family into your home for a meal or perhaps even give them a room to call home, may we be reminded that Christ’s work on the cross was ultimately an act of hospitality, making a way for us to return home to God’s love.And despite the many challenges you will face because you’re two imperfect people doing life together, when you faithfully continue in marriage until you die, may your faithfulness remind us that God’s love is perfectly faithful. No matter what we do, God does not abandon those He loves.Amen!Want to watch the rest of the toast? Check it out at http://vimeo.com/476951550
