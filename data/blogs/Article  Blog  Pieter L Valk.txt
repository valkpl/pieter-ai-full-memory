From Pray-the-Gay-Away to Pansexual Pragmatism
Over the past decade the number of people who identify as LGBT+ has doubled, particularly among those who identify as pansexual and are opening to choosing a life partner based on something other than greatest physical attraction. Yet over the same time span, the son of conversion therapy creator Joseph Nicolosi Sr. has created and popularized a new conversion therapy call "reintegrative therapy" for gay people trying to get straight married. What do we do with these seemingly parallel but also contradictory trends?

‚ÄúChasing After Earnest Confession‚Äù in Anglican Compass
Ever woken up with a moral hangover? Here's how I chased after earnest confession while on a cold morning run. In my latest article in Anglican Compass, I recount a time years ago when I recited the common confession after a moral failure and wrestled with whether I meant the memorized words: "I woke up with a moral hangover..."

Yes, Rosaria, Christians do have LGBT+ neighbors...
In a recent article on Clear Truth Media, Rosaria Butterfield argues that none of us have LGBT+/queer neighbors because LGBT+ people do not exist. She goes on to explain that God did not intend for anyone to be queer (no one is ontologically a sexual or gender minority); therefore a Christian who concedes to their neighbor being an LGBT+ person is complicit in a lie that will lead them further away from Jesus. So, what did Rosaria Butterfield get right (and wrong) in her recent article about sexual orientation and ontology?

‚ÄúWhen Heavyweights Change their Minds‚Äù in Firebrand Magazine
A blurb recently appeared on the Yale University Press website for a new book by Dr. Richard Hays and his son (out Sept 2024) in which it seems he'll reveal his change to a revisionist sexual ethic. Like me, many Christians over the past few decades have read Hays's 1996 "Moral Vision of the New Testament" and referred back to his earlier work to justify our commitment to historic sexual ethics. When theological heavyweights like Hays change their minds, it's disorienting for many. For me, it led to a now all-too-familiar cycle of fear, disappointment, betrayal, and hop

Is giving up romance a sacrifice?
Some Christians are theologically convinced that gay romance/sex are sins, but deep down they still feel like people need romance to be happy. Deep down, it doesn‚Äôt feel fair that celibacy often seems like the only option God offers to gay people. Some earnestly wonder whether God is asking gay people to sacrifice more than other Christians and whether that‚Äôs good.

How can you respond to convincing arguments for revisionist sexual ethics?
Christians need to be able to make a winsome, positive case for a historic sexual ethic. But sometimes you get an email or someone knocks on your door, and the conversation goes something like, ‚ÄùYeah, I understand your arguments for a historic sexual ethic, but what about‚Ä¶‚Äù and they go on to list one of the convincing arguments for a revisionist sexual ethic. How can you respond?

Vocational Singleness is a Gospel Cornerstone
Some who know Jesus experience crippling doubt. Others who don‚Äôt yet know Jesus see a Creation in chaos. Christ‚Äôs promises seem to ring hollow, the kingdom is coming too slowly, the gospel feels feeble. Thankfully a potent vehicle of kingdom work and kingdom hope for the early Church is available to God‚Äôs people today, if we will only embrace and nourish it. Amid Christ‚Äôs ministry on earth, he instituted a vocation meant to give us hope for the kingdom to come and to bring forth that kingdom with undivided attention: the vocation of singleness.

Do Christians Have ‚ÄòRespect for Marriage‚Äô?
As the Respect for Marriage Act is set to pass, some Christians will mourn the further entrenching of secular values. Others will cheer the loosening grip of the Religious Right. To those of us holding tightly to God‚Äôs Word and praying that godly marriage would bless our country, can I ask an honest question:
Do we have respect for Christian marriage?
