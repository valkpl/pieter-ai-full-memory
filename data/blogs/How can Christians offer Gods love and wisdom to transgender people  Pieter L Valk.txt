Over the past year, Equip has partnered with Jesse White, a seminary-trained Christian leader who has been faithfully stewarding his own gender incongruence. Together, we’ve developed a brand-new resource to help pastors and Christians navigate this conversation in their communities:
“Understanding Gender Incongruence & Caring for Trans* People” is a 4-session course that (1) helps Christian leaders and parents think empathetically and theologically about gender incongruence and (2) equips Christian leaders and parents to offer God’s love and wisdom to trans* people.
Session 1: Empathize with the stories of people navigating gender incongruence and ground conversation in shared terminology
Session 2: Examine passages of Scripture often cited in conversations about gender ethics and explore how Equip invites Christian leaders and pastors to think theologically about ministering to trans* people
Session 3: Survey alternate Christian and non-Christian perspectives on gender ethics and learn how you can better care for those navigating gender incongruence in your churches and families
Session 4: Learn how to care for kids and teens who share about incongruence and consider a series of case studies spanning a range of scenarios you might encounter
Get on-demand access to Equip’s Gender Incongruence Course today for just $50. On your own or in a group, you can watch all course sessions led by Jesse, reflect and discuss using course handouts, and review what you’ve learned with detailed notes.
Or, if you’re not ready to jump in just yet, read samples of “Understanding Gender Incongruence & Caring for Trans* People” on Equip’s Blog, including articles about pronouns and name changes, who trans* people are in God’s eye, and suicide prevention.
