You may have seen this demotivational poster of St. Sebastian in the background of one of my recent videos. I read about something similar in Eve Tushnet’s book “Tenderness” and I couldn’t resist designing and printing a version for myself.
The sarcasm and double meaning are deeply satisfying.
A quick glance might lead the viewer to think it’s merely a baroque image with a trite-yet-encouraging Christian message.
But then you notice that the image shows St. Sebastian, particularly known for his martyrdom. And the caption takes on new meaning.
We like the idea of trusting God when we assume that He’s got plans of worldly comfort, wealth, and prosperity for us.
But what if God’s roadmap for us leads to martyrdom of some sort? What if He’s planned humiliation, pain, and abandonment for us?
Are you still interested? Am I?
That’s why I find the tongue-in-cheek message of this poster so satisfying. Many days, it feels like it accurately contains my doubt and hope and surrender.
The cherry on top?
St. Sebastian is considered by some to be the patron saint of the gays :)
