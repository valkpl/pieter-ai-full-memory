 Hi there. If this video is coming up in your subscription box, there's a good chance about five or six years ago you subscribe to an eighth grader reviewing some technology on here. I have since dropped the bulk cut, which is disappointing I know, but yeah, I am posting a video on here. Lots happen since then. The main thing being that I am a Christian. I've been a Christian for about three years now. Going into my junior year of college right now. I met a really critical age of just asking a lot of questions and trying to figure things out. That's what this is for. I reached out to the guest of the podcast today, Peter, because I came across as an industry and just to story and I had some questions. He sent me an email that just rocked my world with so much new information. I was like, hey, I think this information should be out there. Why don't we talk and record it? That's this is. I didn't know if it was going to be like a one-off thing. I like a new thing or not, but you'll see in the video that there's more things I want to talk to him about. So at least with Peter, I'm hoping there's more videos. But yeah, I'm excited about this. I've gotten a connect with some really cool people online with asking questions and stuff like that. And I hope that this is another way to do that. Yeah, I have no idea what this is going to become. I don't even know what it's called yet. But my goal is just to ask some questions, kind of disable some of the caricatures or stereotypes or assumptions around ideas. I'm just going to make some friends doing it. So I hope you enjoy the video today. And yeah. Cool. All right, guys. So my guest today is Peter Bach from National Tennessee. I'm reading the introduction up here to the side because it is very likely you're a very busy man. Peter is a gay Christian committed to a traditional sexual ethic and he is intentional about that terminology. He's an executive director of EQUIP, a nonprofit Christian counseling ministry that helps churches become places where gay people can survive according to God's wisdom. Peter is also a licensed professional counselor and needs a therapy client to navigate questions of faith and sexuality. Then outside of work, he helps start the Nashville family of brothers in ecumenically Christian monastery in Nashville that offers family to men called the single mischievous sake of the kingdom. Peter studied at Vanderbilt University, lived in the university and Gordon Conwell, theological seminary. So yeah, Peter is a very, very busy man. So I'm thankful that I got to steal for a little bit of this conversation. Peter, thanks again, just for joining me. Yeah, thank you for creating this opportunity. And I guess the short version of it could be Peter and the recovering work of all it. Hey, the first steps have been the problem, right? Yeah, the first steps were the curriculum. No, they're all fantastic and so identifying the so needed today. So I'm really thankful that I have this perspective here. Just kind of starting off of like a general introduction. I noticed in your material the terminology gay Christian being very specific in the traditional sexual ethic, also being very specific terminology that comes up again, again, again, in your material. Can you kind of just talk a little bit about maybe your story with same sex attraction? And then how your church and your community handled that as to your coming up? Yeah, and I'll at the end I'll also explain kind of why I tend to use those two phrases. But they tend to be pretty clear. Kind of senses on kind of different sides of the field to the speak. So you know, using the phrase gay Christian, perhaps signals to people that, you know, this is this is an exact attraction is an enduring part of my story. It is shaped the way I see the world and the way I see God and and it's obviously shaped kind of the work I do, my nine to five job. And so that's a meaningful reality for me. It's not a, it's not ontologically who I am, but it's a meaningful reality for me. So so by using that word, I'm clarifying on one side of the fence, you know, I don't think that the phrase gay away works. I'm not attempting to become a straight person. I'm also making clear that I believe that God calls it all people to all Christians to a traditional sexual ethic. And that is what I am called to. And so on the other side of the fence, I don't think abandoning a traditional psychological or psychological aspect is good for me. And find myself in between those two fences. And it's admittedly a strange place. It's a narrow space. It can be a kind of lonely space. It's a space that neither the, neither culture nor the church wants to help. It tends to be demonized by people on both, both in both sides of the fence on the other side of the fence and both direction. So but yeah, long story short, I grew up in a Christian family in kind of rural northeast Tennessee. And you know, I've heard anyone talk about homosexuality growing up. It was a brief kind of statement that God has against homosexuality that God hates gay people. So when I realized in early middle school that I was attracted to other guys at the same sex that I was gay, I was, well, first I, I was more decided and I tried to ignore it for a long time, pretend it wasn't a case. And then once I stopped pretending that it wasn't the case, I tried to make it go away. I started praying asking God to change my sexual orientation to heal me to remove my things like the fractions and I started the next decade. I had three different trips to promise they could increase my opposite sex attraction. I prayed hundreds of times God would remove my same sex attraction. I went to multiple kind of men's weekends, particularly from men who experience things like the practice and coping that it was. Those are these experiential therapy weekends with boost my masculinity and you know, fix my gay problem. And I even intern for a crazy gay way of ministry, I'd have to call it for nine months, hoping that maybe if I just eat less and breathe enough, that'll do the truth. And none of it changed one bit my same sex attraction. And and that's not surprising. You know, all the research out there about sexual orientation change efforts shows that 96% of people who would change sexual orientation change efforts, it's very no meaningful change and they're same sex attraction, but they're same individual experiencing 92 increase into a sideality. And just to say more briefly, that the attempting of sexual orientation change nearly doubles some of what we've been attempting to do. Now, definitely the case for me. Thankfully, I know the guy ever seriously contemplated through this side, but I dealt with deep levels of shame and anxiety and isolation and loneliness because of the clock because I believe that the only way that God would love me is this I can come straight or at least appear straight. And that was really destructive. But throughout this time, I continued to believe be a Christian and believe that the Bible is how I know who God is and that even when it's in convenience, what God thinks about the topic is what is best for me. You know, it's not what I wish. God is a thing you know would be you on a particular topic. So yeah, you know, in time, I shared my story with some people in my world and I wasn't as alone in my story anymore. I shared my parents sophomore year of high school and they didn't know how to help me anymore than I knew how to help myself, but at least I wasn't alone in this anymore. I shared with the campus ministry that I worked for or seen that I come with a student leader for in college and I led a Bible studies and I led recruitment efforts for freshmen and I was a representative for the campus ministry too, the university and was given every reason to believe that if I wanted to go on staff at this campus ministry when I graduated that I could and then at the end, toward the middle of my senior year, without any warning, I was told not to apply to go on staff at that campus ministry or that at that university or that campus ministry and the other university. The only explanation I was given was we don't know what to do with your same sex interactions. So those really painful, but thankfully many of the times that I shared my story, you know people have responded well, responded very beautifully. I mean one, from example, that comes to mind is that during my sophomore year of college, there was a guy who left our Christian fraternity that I was a part of because he decided he wanted to continue in a romantic and sexual relationship with a man and that was against our our Christian fraternity's code of conduct and some of the brothers and some of the people on campus are going to respond to that whole situation poorly and so I wanted to share my testimony with all of the brothers, the 100 guys in our fraternity. Because I wanted the guys in there who were strange, they'll have a better love hanging with like me and I wanted the guys in that fraternity who were gay and had this in convictions as me so that they weren't alone. And terrifying shared my story and my surprise that I had to go online up, afterwards, shoes, your share, your shoes, you know, bring it up their phone and say hey, let's take off your heels to me, I want to get to know you better, like what's your story and then over the kind of six months after that, ten or so guys in the fraternity, privately share with me that they have the same story and the same conviction for most of them first time they'd ever told anyone. That was a beautiful result of that and kind of over the news in the next two or three years I did a lot of life with those guys in particular in college. I am Christian and committed to a traditional sexual ethic and one thing we all had in common was we all seem to be afraid that if we followed God's teaching, we would be alone and not of a select we had parents or pastors who knew how to care for as well. And so many ways that became I was the beginning of what would come equipped for me. It would become this ministry effort that I started seven years ago. Two equipment parents and pastors with you understanding skills that they need to better love and minister to. According to a traditional sexual ethic and that's what it quick does today we've partnered with my primary job as running equipped. We work for church and come to the complex as we're gay people from the front of the police way. Traditional sexual ethics. So yeah I kind of leave it there. We'll probably come back to the whole gay Christian conversation, the whole traditional sexual ethic conversation but yeah that's a bit of my story and kind of where I'm at. That's incredible. Wow I just like there's so many times in this story that I just filled with like it's like my heart's like broken and there's just like hope in my heart broken and it's like hope. Wow like I really hope everyone is feeling that. Before getting even into the other topics just because I think that there's so much value in that. For churches that are looking to become educated on this like maybe it is the first time hearing about it reasantly do kind of have this lacking just before we even get anything else. How can churches get in contact with you and with Equip to kind of learn more about about where they're hurting and this and how they can get better. Currently, the easiest way to find me is my social media handle is PIEPRL. These are the Victor A-L-K. Peter LVolk with an extra eye in Peter. That's my kind of handle on all platforms social media platforms. Or you can go to Equip's website which is EquipYourCommunity.org and find some more information about Equip and also contact our team to get some to see if Equip is a good fit for your church. Awesome. Swades. Yeah, the extra eye in Peter by the way. The last like two weeks up until yesterday when I double checked on another podcast to see what actually was Peter I've been referring to you as Peter. So. Yeah, actually I was getting hand personally. That's Prim mother. Turned out since it's differently but I don't know if that's because you just have an accent or because I should be pronouncing it differently in an American English like I don't know. Yeah. I love it. Well, cool. I thank you for getting that out there. I just for churches that are realizing this right now. I just wanted to make sure it was out there. Yeah, I think there's so many different things from Boffe's story. But I would love to kind of come back to this idea of God's best as I said, waiting to us, just talking about same-sex attraction and then privacy at marriage. Like you talk about what the scripture teaches is being inconvenient but being God's best. Can you talk a little bit about that kind of you're realizing that? Because I'm sure in the beginning you have frustrations of really being challenged by the scripture, but it seems to come really come to love it and to see it as the best. Yeah, I wouldn't say best as in it's easy or at the beginning. Or even at the time, up here is the most good or more most beautiful. But I know what is the most likely to be true. And it also helps point out the ways maybe our churches are falling short. I'm embodying what is true in ways that are good. Beautiful. And many of the work of the quit of the work of the National Family Brothers is the health churches and the visuals and body and traditional sexual equality. What I would is true in a way that leads to goodness and beauty. Yeah, I mean, I think a fundamental level I'm convinced that I got exist. I'm convinced that that God knows better than me what is best for me and I believe that the Bible and the church is how we know who that God is and what that God thinks about different things and what God wins in this world. And, on all the other this story of God made us to be in relation to what God gave us free will and choice. And even though we chose not God and that for our brokenness and for the world, made an even larger effort of becoming man and dying on the cross to try to reunite us with him to invite us back into relationship with him fully. So, sorry, the car passing. I'm doing this while I'm going on a walk in my neighborhood which I found helps me focus on phone calls. Anyway, I love it. Yep, yep. So, yeah, I think so, you know, I said I'm convinced of a traditional sexual equality. Well, what do I mean by that? Well, what is that exactly? Why am I convinced of that? What does that mean for gay people? So, as I understand it, a traditional sexual ethic, what the church, how the church has consistently understood the Bible to teach about God's wisdom, for sexual stewardship, for all people and particularly for Christians, is that God best for every Christian is either a lifetime vocation of abstinent singleton for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention. Or a lifetime vocation of marriage between one man and one woman, but then ultimately, it's the importance of union work, embracing children. So, that's what I believe that God best is for a Christian, but that's how the church is consistently understood the Bible to teach is not best. How do I know that we see this, this, this consistently promotes culture, and Genesis 1, God's original order in creation, confirmed in Matthew 19, but Jesus teaches us about calling these people back to God's high standards, for what marriage is that God joins us with faith, and then offering this alternative to marriage, which is the thing on this for the sake of the kingdom. We got it also honored. In 1st, 27, where we're affirmed these teachings, how you teaching of marriage in the field of teachings, why we're polypurn, how you teach in the language, and how you teach in the community. It makes clear for us why the sexual difference marriage is important because marriage is supposed to be an image of sacrament that helps us teach us about God's love, which is mysterious and hard to understand, and so God gives us these ordinary things that we ought to treat in sacred ways, and then when we treat them, when we properly care for them and build them up as devices and beautiful devices that teach us about God's, then they can remind us about what's through about God. So anyway, so you have the whole of this group for convinces me that that is the fact of how God thinks about this. And then of course that's how the church has consistently understood the scriptures, that the Jesus A's, the authority of His teaching to the Apostle. And those Apostles pass down by laying on a hand that the content of Christ's teaching, I mean authority of Christ to to to generations of leaders in the church, tracing all my tips today, and those leaders have consistently taught on the subject. So that's why I'm convinced of that. So what does that mean? What does that mean for gay people? Well, what that means is that it's also not for gay people. When God inspired the author of the scripture to write now these passages of scripture that that convinced us to make clear God was in his dining these ways, God wasn't, they were gay people then. And God was not surprised by the reality of gay people. And he kind of, oh, what's that? For God to make some accommodations for them. I forgot to bend the rules or change the rules a little bit for them. No, I got God had to still God's tree for all people. That's not a surprise to him. So what does that mean? I think those things are also not for gay Christians. Absolutely, I'm just going to say that the kingdom or navigating the complexities of opposite sex marriage was an openness to the important team to work of raising kids. So, you know, I don't think there's any context, there's no context for same sexual and romantic activity that God blesses in scripture or to put a finer point on it. I think same sexual and romantic activity are since in any context. But I want to add a couple of kind of clarification. The first being that I don't think that God intended for me to be gay. Okay, I don't think that when God first imagined me and imagined what if Peter was born into a perfect world that he intended for me to have same sexual attraction. But because the world is fallen because because I am broken, the genetic level, because I was floored in my mother's room. And perfectly because I was born into an imperfect world that injured me much, much, long before I ever named agency myself and was able to make decisions for myself and that it would impact me. Yeah, I, I, the fall act right and it affects all and so I think because of that broken relationship, I develop these things to the traction. So I think they're, I think they're a brokenness. I think they are a situation. But it's not a sin to be broken. It's not a sin to be tempted. I don't, I don't sin by merely experiencing things like the fraction. But it's a sin to be how merely for being gay, merely for being like employees are proletting you girl. But I answer a thought for how I respond to it. I feel, I feel, I'm also, I'm also, I'm also, I'm a steward, I'm a steward, I temptation to respond to them. And I have to clarify earlier that the solution isn't sexual orientation change. You know, people don't first, first, to clarify, people don't choose to be gay, but also there's no formula for changing people sexual orientation. So where does that lead to? Still gay and God, best for me. You don't want to go with Ben and scripture. And we'll got a calling to is to daily steward, mind sexual orientation, according to a traditional sexual orientation, so men to God with them, to seek the best things that he has offering. And also to recognize that experiencing sexual interaction that gay is a word that our culture uses to describe people like me, that when I use that word, I'm not implying anyone's theological convictions or anyone's sexual conduct. It's just the word that middle schoolers today, and elementary school kids today use to describe girls who like girls and boys who like boys. That's the word I'm using. And it's true that like in the US, the cultural identity matters. We're very tribal is country, even those who claim to not be a part of a tribe. That's actually those are actually tribes in themselves. So all of us, like, it's kind of baked into who we are as American to see ourselves as the same as people who are like us. And then feel like camaraderie with them, feel like a saying this. And benefit when they're helping ways of this is done. I have heard from the maybe some of the ways that those different cultures have intentionally or accidentally happened upon some of the virtues, some of the fruits of the spirit that God wants for us, the scripture, and ways that they can give us courage, as they can give us tenderness, ways that they can help us persist in the midst of brokenness. So, yeah, I think I touched on all of it there. Yeah, that was fantastic. I was thinking about all your listening to it. I was like, dang, he's hitting like everything. No, I think that's so valuable understanding the specifics of that terminology. Now, I know for me, even as I'm listening to this now, it's helping me understand a little bit more how to interact with these topics in our modern context, where it's like, yeah, like use the word gay. I think there's definitely a reluctance to do that, but it just makes sense. And it makes a very powerful statement of what God's will is in the scriptures. And then it's so clear. I remember one last thing I'm going to tell you. I want yeah, I do it. And the last thing was, someone's probably wondering, okay, it's a peer, what does mean for you personally, which may have been a question you were about to ask. And so I, while I'm not quite sexual and not generally attracted to women as well, I did kind of date a couple of women in college with very transparent with them about my sexuality and we just kind of, I thought they were cool. They thought I was cool. I was like, well, I mean, I'm gay, but I mean, we could go out some dates and see what happens. You know, and with a couple of them, I actually ended up developing some kind of specific kind of unique desires for them. And and and, and, and sharing you the details, like I know that Christian marriage would have worked with them that it thought was calling it that. The Christian marriage could work for me if God called me to that. So, but I also needed to this thing on the Jesus and feel it's a Paul and scripture of a telecomption for me. And I don't know, I was playing other than just the Holy Spirit made clear to me that I'm not, I wasn't supposed to just go to take what I wanted. And I was supposed to ask God, not you and a friend. Or which of those I pursue, which of those I've done to and over kind of an accidental discerning process over three or four years, God made certain of the key what's calling to that lifetime vocation of the absolute thing on this for the sake of key to work with undivided potential. So, that's what I'm committed to and that's why I have the time and energy to do that laundry list of kind of kind of kind of work that you share at the beginning of the podcast. But, but I don't think that that's a call to like loneliness for the sake of the gospel. I think that vocation will singleness as I call it is still a call to to permanent lived in human family. And so, the way that I'm finding that is I'm a part of helping start with called the National Family Brothers, which you shared about, which is essentially like a modern-day monastery kind of, but it's a house where where I do life with other men called to singleness for the sake of the kingdom and we do kind of typical family rhythms together and work kind of increasingly making commitments to a community. And eventually we may launch a pandemic lifetime commitment to the community. This should be my family. This will be the people I'm home to after work and the people who take me out from the airport and the people that I go on vacation with and the people that I cry with effort and people that I grow old with and I holding hands with. So, yeah. Pottery in the heart on that one. That is like I was so I first listened to this, I promise to solve the next. I first listened to your podcast with President Sprink on Theology and the Rock. And when you started talking about the National Family Brothers, I was just like, it was so new to me. And I think it's actually hearing you describe it there. That is so beautiful. That is just so beautiful. I think that's something that I've as I've wrestled with first Corinthians 7 and just celibacy and marriage in these topics as a adult. There is that connotation of loneliness. You know, it's, oh, I'm going to go home to my empty apartment at the end of the day. And yeah, that's not appealing. So I think finding that. And I argue that that's not really what's in. Yeah, I argue that I don't think this is this son of a lonelyness with celibacy. I don't think that's in scripture. I actually think something opposite of that may be in scripture. But it is one of the ways that I think sometimes churches, Catholic and Protestant have poorly embodied scripture is to kind of capitulate to well, celibacy are just going to be well. And that is effectively re-inscription. We don't read what's on the page anymore. We read into it. Well, that's a lot of the composition. I was going to say, I was thinking that way, I thought, I'm like, there's no way this can be our only conversation. I know I'm going to go back through this and see like four threads that need attention. So definitely, I'm trying to take a direction to take it right here. And I think we touched on this a while ago, but it's I want to touch on it now. You talked about basically, and I've seen this to another places. And you didn't mention this part but specifically, but in the Old Testament, we have marriage being like in a automatic. We have that's the way the Israelites are going to grow. And we do have some like speaking to Unix to the celibate, like an Isaiah, but it's pretty consistent. Like, okay, yeah, if this family's going to be as numerous as the stars, but like we got to get some bread, we got to get some pink and blue. We got to start making some purple, you know. And then coming into the New Testament, it is very, I would say celibacy, not focused, but I think it's more an unsy-a-dly. I think Jesus can Paul really kind of punch up against this idea that marriage is an automatic. And you talked about that with like Matthew 19 and 1st Corinthians 7, but you also said something interesting about the way that church has portrayed it through history as well. I know in my personal wrestle with this, that's been really challenging because I'm sure you come across some of the quotations from early church fathers like Justin Martyr being so proud of the number of celibate singing. Hey, one thing I'll elaborate a little bit on how the church has handled this over the last 2000 years. Yeah, and I think what's really cool here is to look at, you know, the first 300 years of the church and then like the next 1000 years of the church and then the Protestant Reformation and everything comes in because there's been an evolution of sorts. And when you track it, it makes a lot of sense. Yeah, a couple years ago, started asking the question, and particularly for the sake of kind of more Protestant audiences who maybe don't give a lot of ways to how the church, what the church taught about this a thousand years ago. Okay, but give more way to, okay, well around the same time that we put the Bible together and we, and we, and we can the nice and creed and we clarified our theology of the Trinity and our theology of the person who had Christ like when most Protestants still agree that church had its mojo and had its authority. What were they teaching? What were they thinking about shallows these in? Yeah. And because that's happened much worse for us, how the nice and creed does. As the theology of the Trinity, the old theology of the person who had Jesus should have in terms of trusting the wisdom of the church, right, because the same people same time cured. So, and also, you know, we're talking about the people that Jesus taught, the people that the apostle taught, the people that they heard from, you know, like when I imagine kind of this conversation that happens in Matthew 19, you got Jesus talking of these different kind of religious leaders and also with disciples around and they're kind of talking about these things. Or first Corinthians seven, I imagine, you know, Paul pinning or dictating this letter to the church and Corinth, you know, that's just a small part of the conversation, right? I mean, what, you know, Matthew 19 after, you know, Jesus said these kinds of strange things about being like a unit for the sake of the kingdom. You know, you got to imagine that after that, the disciples from the asking a lot more questions and maybe you don't get a lot more content. And we don't have that recorded, you know, that's not what God chose to give up, right? Lord, gosh, I got to imagine that the scribes were helping Paul write down the letter to the Corinthian and ask for Paul says to what these things and chapter seven about his preference, at least practical preference for resiliency and guidance and the scribes saying, okay, so what I'm waiting for, I got a couple questions, you know, and so the people that were around and were taught by the apostle, maybe they even have poor information. Then we have now about how Jesus and Paul thought about this. Okay, so first two, three hundred years of the church, how do they understand Jesus and Paul, Jesus, and Paul, Jesus, and Paul? First, clear everything. Unanimously, unanimously, every source of those first three hundred years, they believe it would you just empower talking about him after you mentioned in Christcham B.7, was a permanent giving up of the possibility of dating a Roman numerage. There was no question of whether or not this is a lifetime commitment that we were talking about. It absolutely, lifetime commitment. That's number one. Number two, then it's well documented that like, you know, people didn't, when they made his commitment to cellulosee, they didn't go then run off into caves, run off into the desert, or run away from their local church, or or or or or kind of give up all of their money in the just become beggars on the street. No, consistent documentation showed you these these these kind of city cellulose continue to attend their local church. Continue to live in the city. We're participating in the economic system of this city. They had jobs, they were jobs like everybody else. And and they consistently understood that they were supposed to use their availability, not raising to serve their city to serve the church. And then last thing that we had learned from the first two, three hundred years of the church, how did they do community? Well, for a while, some of them thought, oh, maybe it would just continue to live with kind of our biological family. I think of people, you know, and not work out for some people, but like think Jerome and some other people commented that that and people committed to cellulosee living among other married, but not living with other single people committed to cellulosee, they helped it kind of loneliness from this lack, you know, but that didn't seem to really work out. Okay, they tried that option, didn't really work out. It's great. Um, another thing that we see kind of hints at even in first Corinthians seven is this idea of like a spiritual but trotal, almost like a celibate partnership, like two people of the opposite sex who both were committed to cellulosee, but said, hey, let's pair up, let's kind of live in the same house, provide financially and kind of, and I'm, I'm proud for protection for each other and provide stability and some companionship. But as you can imagine, those weren't always very faithful either. Okay, so that's not very very good solution. Then they landed on the third solution, which I'm not the kind of the most popular, which was living in small communities of cellulosee people of the same family, a family of the same family, a proud homonocere, but in the middle of the city. So a group of five or two men all committed to cellulosee living together in a house together as if the family unit. Um, that was kind of what the early church landed on in terms of the most common way for cellulosee people to find family to find community. Um, and, and some of these, some of these cities with the with with, so the cellulosee people in it, um, that number of the questions had 10, 20, 30, cellulosee questions in the city. Huge, huge numbers. Very common. Um, so then what happened? Well, we're from New York, how do we get off track? And what's the theory of why? Getting to then like kind of the fourth century. This whole thing of the city's cellulosee. It seems to kind of like suddenly go away. And in all the cellulosee, it's now, are either being a doctor or engaged or in solitary ways or in these like monasteries away from the city. You know, some of the motivations may have been fully from persecution. Some of the motivations, if you look at the text, seem to be that, uh, that clergy actually were kind of like coming kind of a power struggle with all of these, uh, these, celibates in the city. Uh, because these celibates weren't clergy themselves, so they weren't, they were not submitted to the clergy. They didn't have to do with the clergy told them to do. I got there where this kind of influential, very active part of the community. And so they'll see a political struggle between clergy and celibate people. Uh, hopefully the clergy were able to force the celibate people into monasteries so that the clergy could then have authority and power over them. Anyway, so whatever the reasons were, we find ourselves in the fourth to century and going on is the very escapism, um, navel gazing version of celibate. Away from the city, away from the poor, away from married people and kids, away from King Dumpark. Running away. Um, and, you know, things get better over the next 1000 years until the reformation, um, the certainly loft of movements of monasteries, um, the deference dyscoons and the deptings, that, uh, that became more engaged in their communities and and saw their celibates as an opportunity for service. Um, but kind of coming up to the Protestant reformation, one of the things we have is, is a celibacy becoming, uh, mandatory for the priesthood on the Catholic Church. Um, and the, the, the Catholic Church doing a couple things that weren't super-wise. One, they weren't kind of, uh, carefully, making sure that people were discerning whether they were called the celibate of your marriage. And that's a, that, that, that, that, peacefully pushing into, um, into celibacy and into the priesthood. So many of you have some people who are committed to celibacy, who are not out of someone's capital, or, the second thing they were doing. They were doing, they were teaching the celibacy with better than marriage, right? That's not inscripture. That's not biblical, but they were, so they were giving a false teaching that it was better to me, celibate than it was to be married. On 30th of the Catholic Church was doing poorly is, and they weren't, um, providing practical circumstances in which celibate people could, could find family and thrive. They were, instead, they were sending a much of priest, kind of outstated across the country, um, loving alone or not living with much of a, a support of a local church, and then in that loneliness and that lack of support to all the intersection. And the church was excusing their section with them. And those two, dealing with the problem, you know. So that and many other things, they are, are not the reformers, risk react to, this abuse of celibacy. Unfortunately, what the reformers do is not to go back to scripture and correct the abusees, but instead it's to throw away the category of celibacy. Um, what was to say that, the problem is, not as really only calling one out of a thousand people to have a single list for the sake of the kingdom, but really functionally, everyone's supposed to be married. And we need to stop teaching what the Bible has to say about celibacy. We need to, we don't need to value what the Bible has to say about celibacy. We don't need to help anyone discern what they're called the celibacy. We don't think it's good for anyone to make any kind of commitments to celibacy. We are going to abolish these monasteries. Um, and we see the legacy of all of that today in Protestant churches. Protestant churches don't teach passages of scripture that talk about celibacy. They do teach about it. They teach about it as this kind of, it's just for a couple of people who are called to go to the Emissionary as an Africa and Yadiyada, Yadada, and be alone, right? God will magically sustain them in their ministry. Um, there's definitely no encouragement for the average teenager or young adults discern between marriage and celibacy and there are no monasteries, right? There's no community. It's the secret soft that the early church discovered was the way that celibacy people find family in celibacy and therefore are spacial to their celibacy and spacial to their communities. It's the living kind of groups of five to ten people, celibacy people of the same sex. Um, in their cities connected to their local churches and a part of the local economy. We don't think any of our churches do in that today. Um, how I think there's a, that's all to say I think in scripture and and the wisdom of the early church, we've got a clear template for for how to do this well, how to do this, you know, this is a beautiful, well, and there's definitely ways to both the Catholic church and Protestant churches, I kind of fall in short of that. We seem to have lost that. There's so much in that that I did not know. Um, thank you so much for sharing all of that. Oh, I'm so happy. I don't even, yeah, I just appreciate it. I don't even know where it's going to go. Um, I have to wrap up in a couple of minutes because I'm actually at work right now. You missed it in my lunch hour ends. Um, but I would love to get some more time with you and maybe kind of give Christians some more guidance on what is that discernment process? Look like what are ways that even if we are called to pursue marriage, how can we be there for some more time? Um, so, um, I think we're going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of time to do with the church. Um, and then a bunch of the points earlier that we hit on to, I would love to get another chance to to steal some of your insight. Could I be great. I look forward to it. Great. Well, with that, Peter again, thank you so much for taking the time. I really appreciate it. I think this was so insightful. I think a lot of people are probably going to be a little challenged by this. And I think that's exciting. So yeah, thank you for your insight. Thank you for what you're doing. I know that there's a ton of people out there that don't know it yet, but they're really grateful for what you're doing right now. You're all thanks for the opportunity. Yeah, absolutely. All right. I'll talk to you soon, Peter. All right, let her do it. Right. All right. So I have two minutes. Thank you guys for listening to this. Still don't know what this is going to be called. Don't know. I guess we know another one's probably going to happen now. God willing. Yeah, I think Peter is a fantastic guy. I think he's a stud. I think in that 45 minutes, I've just had so much like transformed up here. A little kind of just sharing like on why this was the first thing. I wrestled with Frisprintheon7 and the early churches perspective on silvesty for the past seven months. And I have like clinical anxiety, so it's been really, really rough, especially because I'm in a relationship that I hope ends in America. And it's really challenging looking to pause practical praise. How I'm using Peter's language that I want to ask more about what he means by Paul practically praising it. But like undivided devotion to the Lord, because I think it's so assumed today the marriages for one in the church. I was part of a biblical manhood program last semester and we had agreed and a sixth of it was how we would be as husband's fathers. So it's definitely an assumption, it's definitely an frame. I think we all see that. And I think Peter has a really valuable perspective. I feel personally for me kind of a caballi-mines idea. I trust his perspective a lot because he doesn't have a whole lot to gain from it. I think when I listen to some maybe some pastures online where they're married and they're preaching on the subject and they maybe just write off first grade seven as oh, that was a famine in Frisprintheon. But it's definitely could have been. I'm just saying I don't think it's been fully flushed out. I really trust Peter's perspective to tell me what marriage should look like. If that makes sense. So really excited. I'll get something else in the calendar with him soon. Thank you guys for watching and I've noticed this is going to go but I'm excited about it. So all right. I'll see you guys soon.
