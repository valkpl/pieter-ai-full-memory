 Hey everyone, it's Josh. Welcome to Life on Side B. Today we're going to be doing something special. We're going to be talking with Peter Volk about his talk at Revoice on Theology. And I wanted to take this moment really quickly before we start to say that in this conversation you're going to be hearing us telling you to go watch his talk that happened at Revoice on the Revoice website before it goes down at the end of August. Well, this episode is being published in the last day of August. Originally this episode was planned to be published earlier, but I ended up getting sick and don't worry. It was not Corona. Thank God. So I was just finally able to get the editing done for this episode to publish it now. So if you are listening to this episode on the day of airing, you still have time to go watch the talks at Revoice if you have not. If you have awesome, if you haven't, you can still go over and register for the conference and watch it before it goes down at the end of today. So make sure you do that. Not just Peter's talk. All of the talks are amazing. It's so worth it. And you still have time. So I just wanted to encourage you all about that before we get into it today. So with that, let's head into the episode. Well, hello everyone. Welcome back for another episode of Life on Side B. It is good to be coming back. And I am here joined by our very own grant heartly. Hello, grand. Hey, hello. We haven't heard your voice in a while. Well, it's been a minute. Yes, it has. You did the one Patreon episode, but on the regular podcast, we heard you in a little bit. So I'm so glad you're excited to be back. Yeah, today is going to be a really good topic because we are joined by a familiar voice on the podcast from season one. The one and only Peter Volk. Hey, Peter. Oh, hey. Hey. Why did you? Yes. I'm so glad to be able to talk today. You know, for everyone listening for all of you who were listening to the voice back last month. First of all, if you haven't listened to voice, you need to go ahead and go, you can still register for it and actually rewatch is that correct. Can you still do that? I think it's open till the end of all guests. Okay. I think that's true. All right. Well, if it is, do it. If for some reason, you're listening after that, well, you should have known. It was a really, really good conference. I honestly really enjoyed it. But how did, well, you would you were there? So you guys were both in person. How did it feel for you guys being in person at a virtual voice? Yeah. It was maybe better sweet for me. I definitely missed the in person fellowship. And I was there with some of the other people speaking, but it wasn't the same as the big real voice. And I know for my friends back here in Nashville who weren't there. It wasn't the same. Yeah. So bummed about that. It's not the same without a real audience and without being able to have discussion back and forth. And, you know, the line of one on one afterward, I missed that. But also like so glad that so many people had access to this that wouldn't have normally. Yeah. And it was really parents who like in past years they couldn't have traveled to get to this, but they were able to listen in this time. Pastures and youth passers are usually busy with summer stuff. We're able to join in, you know, maybe people from across the world who wouldn't have been able to fly to St. Louis. So, you know, I don't, maybe the trade-offs worth it. We'll see what happens next year. But yeah, bittersweet. Yeah. What about for you, Grant? Well, I was kind of lucky in that I live in St. Louis. And so I got to visit the place where it was filmed. And I got to sit on the couch in front, the very front row. I mean, there was only one row, actually, because it was just the couch. I've got to sit on the couch and begin it because I saw your face. Oh, that's true. I think I made people uncomfortable enough that they let me in front of the camera. I guilted them into it. No. Yeah, it was fun to be able to see some of the people in person. And I guess to be able to react to what they were saying as it was happening. I was busy live tweeting basically the whole thing. Yeah. So that was really, really fun. And yeah, the reach this year was incredible. It was like 1500 people were registered from 20 something. I think countries, maybe more. Which is just mind blowing. Last year was like 400 people, I think. I think it's like 600 last year. Wasn't it 400 the first year? Maybe maybe right. Yeah, I think that makes it. Yeah. It was huge. Huge. Yeah. It was, it was fun for me. It was interesting because watching it as a participant, you know, on the TV, I really didn't have very high expectations because I was like, I've been going to a few virtual conferences that I was supposed to be physically. And kind of like, okay, cool. This is, you know, another video I'm going to sit down and watch. And I don't know if it wasn't even sure if I was going to watch everything. Just because I've kind of been virtual conference burned out a little bit. Kind of just watching TV. But I actually what really helped with it was, was definitely the tweets being able to, at least be able to interact with some people in that way, and like the chat that was going on during it and being able to see people's responses. Yeah. And I think it was also really nice that a few, a few people kind of coordinated just off, officially some like Zoom calls in between the talks, which for me was really nice as someone to like hop on and I hoped on with Mollinda and a few other people and kind of talking. And we got to Aldi brief about, okay, so what did you think of this one or what did you think of that? And I didn't get to get into all the Zoom calls, but I felt like that was a really nice kind of thing that some people did. That I've just getting into these small little Zoom calls in between and get to debrief with people. So you felt like I felt even being here that I was able to, and cool thing for me was that because it was here in the home, my parents actually watched some of it with me. Yeah. So that was fun because I just put it on the TV and they were like, what are you watching and some like, well, this is Reevoys, which I've told you guys about. So it was, it was also fun that we had like with you and Henry and Becca, we had the Riko host. Yes, from the top of the house. Yes, we did. From the podcast of the cameras. And then on top of that, I kept looking at everyone that was there. And like we've had them on the podcast. We've had them on the podcast. Yeah. I'm lucky. Yeah. I enjoyed that that was that was that was fun for me. The lineup this year was so great. It was just so good. Yeah. Well, we're just going to ask jokingly that are you sure the life on side B podcast is not just like the gay cellal bit keball going everything. I know right. We just are behind. Yeah. All the scenes. Yeah. The cool, the cool news that came out of Reevoys is that our very own Becca is now. The executive director of Reevoys. Yeah. Yeah. And that is super exciting. She's she's going to kill it. I have I haven't no doubt. He's going to be. Yeah. Good. And in fact, she's going to be on the next episode. So we are definitely going to be talking with her about that. Like that's on my priority list. But yeah. Yeah. Well, okay. So to get into it, first of all, we are going to be here talking with Peter about one of his talks. From Reevoys, especially on theology. It was a talk that I'm so glad you did Peter because I don't think we talk about theology and enough in this conversation sometimes. Sometimes we can talk about it too much. The other times we don't talk about it enough. And I thought it was really good. But there was also a lot of conversation afterwards. And so we wanted to kind of engage in that, you know, like you said, because there's not these off of the stage Conversations that normally happen at Reevoys where people get to talk about it. At least this can maybe serve as one of those opportunities. But before we get into it, I did have one announcement that I wanted to share with everyone here. Okay, everyone. So my future self is interrupting my past self because I actually have more information now than I did when we recorded originally. And I want to make sure you get all of the details. We are going to do something new to finish out the season. And you are invited to be part of it. If you love this podcast, if it fascinates you, if you are interested by what we talk about, you're not going to want to miss this. Mark your calendars Saturday, November 14th. We are launching the first ever B-Chats. The B-Chats is a virtual all-day event where we will be talking about real issues that have been discussed in the podcast as well as elsewhere that affect the lies of LGBT+. Or same-sex-attracted Christians who hold a historic Christian view of American sexuality. This is not simply an event where you listen to speakers talk. This will be a place where you get to interact, ask live questions, and discuss how these issues apply to your life or context. The idea is each year. We will talk about three topics or chats and discuss a variety of perspectives from side-by-crisis on those topics. This year, the topics of our three chats are going to be the gender conversation within side-by coming out as LGBT and Christian. And finally, viable side-by relationships. You can go to life on side-by.com and a pop-up rule here to direct you to the registration page for the event. You can also go to our social media as well as the episode notes for this episode and find the link for the registration page there. I'm so excited for us to be able to have this time to close out the season where we will be able to grow and learn together from all around the world. So go ahead and register today. You will want to miss it. And with that, I'll give it over back to my pathself to continue. That's really my only announcement for today. And so with that, let's head into the conversation. So I guess to start Peter, you know, like I said, this is theology related to this is something we, many times do not talk about too much. And I was interested that when you spoke on it, you took a little bit more of a response approach to different affirming theological arguments. I would love to hear more of what led you to take that format. Per suit. If you can talk a little bit more of that. Yeah, so, or if you want to kind of give an overview for people who may not have heard your talk as well, if you want to kind of give a overview about what you talked about. Yeah, so basically I responded to the nine most convincing arguments for a progressive sexual ethic from the perspective of the traditional sexual ethic. The title was arguments aren't enough because the key point I made over and over again was a convincing argument for a traditional sexual ethic or convincing responses to the convincing arguments for a progressive sexual ethic. That's not enough. But gay, Christian, including their sexual is according to a traditional sexual ethic are still experiencing bad fruit and of that and not because they're not trying hard enough because you are church it. Our places where gay people can actually thrive according to God's wisdom. And so, you know, if something is true, it should also be good and beautiful. And a lot of gay Christians, shooting their sexuality is according to a traditional sexual ethic aren't experiencing good or beautiful. So this work to be done. And if, you know, the audience for my talk was particularly pastors, straight pastors and leaders. And so what I wanted them to hear was making better arguments as a manna. If you want to convince people, particularly gay people to stew her sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic, you've got to offer them something good and beautiful. And there's a work done. Because your talk was, for context for everyone who's listening, your talk on theology came during the leaders kind of section of the conference. So, which was more geared towards pastors and pastors and everyone that was listening. Correct. Yeah. I was during the brown Friday. And while it doesn't say, you know, here's the space for straight pastors. It's generally understood that a vast majority of the people who show up for the pastors and leaders track are going to be straight. So it's particularly for the audience. So yeah. How did you come across or structure your talk? Like you listed a bunch of some of the most convincing argument you've heard. Where did you get those arguments from? Did you just hear them or was there a resource that you looked at? Yeah. So there's a couple of different really popular level books that are part story, part kind of theological argument for a progressive sexual ethic out there. And so in addition to doing the work I do with a quip, I'm also a licensed professional counselor. I meet with individuals. Gay people trying to navigate faith and sexuality. And I've had a number of clients who were kind of in this space in between society and side B and they're trying to make sense of that and maybe invited me to help them explore that theologically. And often what we do is we read one of those books together. Wow. Justin Lees, torn, got on the encryption by Matthew Bines. We'll read them together. We'll discuss what's convincing here, what's not convincing here. And so to be honest, the first outline for this talk I wrote a while ago, because I had a close friend or sorry, I had a client who kind of was in between A and B and really feeling like he was going to move to A and it was reading some of those books. And you know, previous to this, I had had both friends and clients who I felt like I was I was too weak. I was too afraid to make a strong case for a traditional sexual ethic and against a progressive sexual ethic. And they ended up adopting a more progressive sexual ethic and I ended up seeing more painful consequences in their lives downstream. And so I don't know that there's this most recent time I was like, okay, this time I'm going to try something different. I'm going to make a more a stronger case before a traditional sexual ethic, but but also against a progressive sexual ethic. And I think this is why I dressed as topic in the way I did. At Revoice, we often hear talks, we often hear messages of what is beautiful about a traditional sexual, right? A wins on the peel floor for a side B. But we seem to kind of back away from responding to the most convincing arguments for a side A, right? We're quick to push against the arguments for side X, understandably. But we seem to be slow to push against the arguments for a side A, which in my opinion is just as dangerous, but in different ways. So, yeah, so long story story, the outline for this talk first started when I was reading one of these books with with the client and trying to respond thoroughly to that the book, the argument in that book for a progressive sexual ethic and that's where these nine points came from. Yeah, I love that format because I've done that before sometimes with some friends of mine who were kind of wondering about theology and we kind of took a similar approach of, hey, let's pick up some books and let's read them together. And I think many times when we're talking with people that that's some of the best ways that we can do it is engage like I think many times pastors want to simply tell LGBTQ people like this is what you need to believe. Rather than sitting down with all of the information with them and being like let's look at it together. Like let's go through this you know this book or that book or and so I love that approach that you took with your friend. Yeah, I also love that like you don't have to be afraid to engage with sources that come from a different ideological camp and you can like you can actually engage with them and you don't have to be afraid that it's going to like persuade you like. I think that's really powerful to enter in through the conversation by looking at all the information. And being able to engage with it, I think that's really wise. Yeah, so after what's the moment that say something? Well, I was just going to say yeah, I know my advice for some of the people I meet with is a lot of these books or or podcasts for a progressive sexual ethic. They're they're very well done they're very emotionally powerful they're clever there sometimes I would say not the most intellectually honest and so I do. I encourage my clients or people I'm mentoring to engage with those sources when they can do it with someone particularly with this this person exploring the theology isn't a really vulnerable place. And they're going to be really susceptible to maybe the emotional appeals or intellectually dishonest appeals. So yeah, don't be afraid of the truth right ask the tough questions and sometimes where people maybe aren't in the the safest places to be challenged. Yeah, critically about things so there's a there's a balance there, but yeah, I definitely those those who just kind of completely avoid any of the strong arguments for a progressive sexual ethic. And so it's going to be the people that then years later it all just comes crashing down because we're completely never carefully tested. So yeah, I think sometimes we can let a traditional sexual ethic be supported mainly by fear and not by any active engagement. Part of that fear is is upheld by just an unwillingness to engage with any of any sources from another perspective. Yeah, so I think that's really encouraging. That for you to engage with this person. Yeah, and I think it's good because I think conversations like the this are needed because if we're not having a dialogue. There's going to be like ultimately if there's not a dialogue happening, then there's only one side voice being heard within the conversation that people are hearing in it like it's funny for my doctorate right now. I'm actually doing work on theology related to LGBT issues and all of that and it's crazy because I had to create a list of resources for my. For my my study and I had tons of affirming sources and I had tons of ex gay sources and I think I had like three deep theological side resources. That was a. And there's not a lot there's there's so much of the of the theology being done from the traditional perspective is very ex gay. There's like except for like people to be loved by somebody pressed in sprinkle and I mean I guess you could count Wesley Hills book, but he doesn't really get into theology he's more sharing history. Yeah, there's not a time there's not there's not these deep view like books like let's digest this theology from a traditional perspective that. Is not ex gay kind of thing. And kind of getting into this what what would you say where you know as you gave this talk what would you say the responses were like to your talk that you got. So really positive particularly from you know the target audience which was straight pathers and leaders you know too often I see. Straight pastors and leaders like shy away from like a full-throated defense of a traditional sexual ethic and being willing to really address the shortcomings of a progressive sexual ethic. You know and if they are convinced of what they believe or they're embarrassed to talk about it. They aren't going to be churches that take any practical steps towards really hoarding side to gay Christians. Really being a place where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic. So so my hope was to have been emboldened in straight pastor. And leaders to take action for the benefit of gay people but also point out that those better arguments weren't enough and there was a lot of positive responses from gay people as well. Some negative responses from you know side a gay people. I guess that's been expected and there were also some side-by-gay Christians who were a little put off. And I guess I think it would be good for me to speak to that briefly. You know it's difficult to speak to every audience well at the same time. And I probably could have said even more clearly at the beginning of the talk that this was particularly for straight pastors and leaders and that's why I was slaughtered in the pastors and leaders track. But if there were any side-by-gay Christians who watched this talk listen to this talk and were hurt by it, I am really sorry. You know too often we've heard straight pastors and parents argue with us about theology and ignore our pain. And if my talk triggered any of that, I'm so sorry. I don't want to add to that. I know that pain myself. I don't want to add to yours. I hope that you saw me holding straight pastors and leaders accountable in the talk. I hope you saw me pointing out the hypocrisy in the church. I hope you saw me arguing the better arguments aren't enough. But yeah again if there's any side-by-gay Christians who watch this talk and it caused them pain. I'm so sorry. You know that absolutely wasn't my intention. Yeah. Yeah. Well if you don't mind sharing some of that feedback from side-by people, what were some of the pushback you received? Well I guess from side-a-air side-by people did anything stick out to you. Yeah. I mean, so I think first, I think for some side-by people because every time they share with a parent or a pastor, side-by-gay people, every time they share with a parent or pastor about how challenging painful their life is. Again, not because they're doing it poorly, but because they don't have structural support from their churches that they ought to have. But we're going with the pain of being in the closet for so long and the wounds in the closet. Two often side-by-gay people go to pastors and parents share about their pain and the response they hear back is, wait a minute, are you not convinced of a traditional sexual ethic anymore? Or are you sharing this for one moment? Hey, I know this is true. But like, but does it have to be true? Is it really true? This is too painful? And the straight person doesn't respond by saying, you're right, this hurts. And it's something is true. It should be good and beautiful. And there's work that sure seems to do. No, instead they freak out that we're going to turn side-a or something and then argue with us more. So I just think a lot of people I heard from just any talk about this that really digs in both of the arguments and kind of combat. Some of the, maybe the side-a arguments that some side-b people who are hurting resonate with, it's just triggering. Mind some of those painful conversations they've had too many times. Yeah. Well, and I can speak to that even as a person who, you know, I spent many, many years in the X-Ga world. And it does become hard because, like, I remember many times hearing the, like, talks, refuting, you know, affirming theology or as they would call it, pro-gay theology in the X-Ga world. They would give these things of refuting it and it can bring up PTSD, especially for people who have experience in the X-Ga world of, like, Oh my gosh, this sounds so familiar, you know, because as you said, and I love one thing that you talked about in the talk you mentioned earlier is that even in responding to these things, the bigger things as you had the title of it being, responding to affirming theology arguments is not enough. And that if we're not creating a culture, we're not creating an environment within our theology that is allowing LGBTQ people to thrive, then it's not enough just to have responses. And I think that, like, when I think so many LGBTQ people will, especially say, be LGBTQ people are freed of engaging in theology because of the way theology has been used as a weapon against us. And I like that you talked about that and you're talking about how we have to make sure we're not using it as a weapon, to just simply make LGBTQ people do what we want them to do. And like, how, I think that's one of the healthy places that in this conversation we have to find how to engage theology, but not use it as a weapon against LGBTQ people. And what do you think are some of the, like, primers of how we can be able to start having that kind of conversation? Yeah, so I think if we're talking about, for asking this question about particularly straight pastors and parents, it's really hard for a side-by-gate Christian to see hypocrisy in their church or in their family when it comes to sexual ethics and sexual stewardship for all, and then take seriously any arguments for a traditional sexual everyday people. So, yeah, my suggestion to straight pastors and parents is that before you start arguing for a traditional sexual ethic for gay people, are you taking seriously with the Bible has to say about sexual stewardship for all people? I think that's really important. Yeah, because somehow convincing gay people to become more convinced of a traditional sexual ethic is not going to make them a magically experienced less pain from the church's poor supporter, gay people and so the people in people who mix orientation marriage. It's just not how it works. So, you know, for the straight pastor and parent, I think that's my first suggestion is kind of take care of your own house, your own people who have the same story as you, who are coming from the same space as you, and earn that credibility. I think if you're asking that question for the side-by-gate Christians, honestly, you know, once you're kind of convinced of a traditional sexual ethic, I don't see a point in spending time and energy and tears trying to like push the dial on your certainty from like 90% to 95% or 100% or whatever, or from 80% to 95%. Like, I think our time is better spent focusing on how can we meet our intimacy needs in healthy ways? How can we get what we need to thrive according to God's wisdom? You know, knowing that the church might not get too much better in our lifetime? I think that's a better use of our time than trying to get ourselves to 100% certain. That's my personal opinion. What do you think you talked a little bit about using theology, like not using theology as a weapon against LGBT people? And you talked about how it's easy to do when you talked about how important it is not to do that. What should be the goal or the focus when approaching theology about LGBT issues? Is there a goal beyond just figuring out what not to do or what to do sexually like boundary some stuff? What's the guiding goal behind all that for you? Yeah, great question. Yeah, so I mean, I think for me, like personally when I was in middle school, the first question I was asking was like, is gay sex a sin? The question we all ask. Yeah, I think that's the question middle school's ask. That's not the question for your pastor should be asking. Because like at least for me, when like I grew up, I realized that a much better use of my time and energy was focusing on the opposite question. Like right not what is bad, but instead would did God deny them for how did God order the world beautifully? What was I made for? Like if I made for intimacy in the context of family, what are the best paths God has laid out for me to enjoy those and focus on that? I can say yes to you. I mean, we've got so many different speakers at re-voice in different spaces in the side of the world. Talk about we've got to focus on the yes and not the no. So I think actually the goal, the focus when we're approaching theology on an LGBT plus topics and issues, we need to focus on what gay people can say yes to that will be good for them. That will bring goodness to their life, that will honor God, that will bring glory to God. So yeah, so for me, I first, I think we should first focus on God's design and wisdom for sexual stewardship for all people. And then ask how that informs how I, a gay person can thrive. Yeah, I don't think personally that I need maybe a special version of theology for me as a gay person to know what God's best is for me. So yeah, I don't focus on personally going to focus on whether or not gay sex is a sin or whatever whether God would bless a gay marriage. I ask God what is his best for his people? And then I can admit not for anything less. That's what I got. Yeah, that reminds me of one of the more formative books for me in my spiritual journey of reconciling, state and sexuality was Eve Fishnitz book gay and Catholic. And one of the winning lines. Oh, it's so good, it's so good. But one of the lines that got to me was she said, no one has a vocation of no. Everyone has a vocation of yes to something. And so we have to figure out what the yes is not just the no. So I think that's, yeah, that was really, really helpful, Peter. Yeah, that's that is really good. Like I when you talked about a book, like how this connects to a book that's influential to you. I thought I was literally about to talk about the same thing, but I was wondering if we were going to talk about the same book for me. Okay, the book that has been was just so beautifully done for me that helped in this. And you know, having, having earlier talked about that there aren't many books. I'll love to recommend books that I do know of that are really good for me. It was Deborah Hirsch's book redeeming sex. I haven't read that one. Oh my gosh. I moved her. She's here. All listening, please come on this podcast. You wrote it. We love you. We wanted to come to this podcast. Please. Well, you're an excellent. Oh, I know. I know. I've heard her speak. And I'm like, wow, I'm a fairly rich guy. Yeah, Australian. I love how she does very much what you're saying is like, rather than just focusing, if all we make this focus is on, like, is gay sex bad or is it good or whatever? We're missing the whole entire thing of really developing what was God's vision for sexuality. And I love that even for Deborah Hirsch, the vision of sexuality is even more than just about who you can have sex with. Because her vision of sexuality is that sexuality is how we relate to people, not just through sex, but through all of our relationships, whether that be through friendship, community. And she lays out, you know, sexuality is three parts of sexuality, gender sexuality, social sexuality and gender sexuality. Gender sexuality, how we understand their self is a male or female social sexuality, all of our interactions and gender sexuality, obviously, who we have intercourse with. And how each of these then reflect the eternal and different ways. And deals with it in a really great way of kind of like what you're saying of we have to be understanding how this fits for all people, straight people, queer people, all of this together. Because the moment that we focus on one small issue within it, we're losing the vision of the rest of it. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess then kind of getting into a few more of the details of your talk. And I think you know when we're talking about the things, some things that were brought up by side B people. You know, during your talk you mentioned that no one chooses their sexual orientation, or at the same time that God did not make us gay. Can you talk a little bit more about that topic? Like what what for you? Does it mean for God not to make us gay even though we don't choose our sexual orientation? Yeah. So okay, so it to be clear, you know, when I say doesn't make us gay, what I mean by that word gay is having romantic sexual same sex attractions. So it might be more precise for me to say I don't think God intended for us to have romantic sexual same sex attractions. We were not born with that kind of predetermined by God. So I'm not talking about like a culture. I'm not saying the gay culture. There's not good things in gay culture. I'm not talking about our capacity to recognize and appreciate beauty regardless of sexual orientation. I think God gives us that. I'm not talking about our desire for same sex friendship or platonic intimacy. Like God obviously gives us that. You know, also I think it's important to point out that like the consensus among scientists is that both genetic factors and environmental factors contribute to the development of same sex attraction. That the people don't choose to be gay but people also aren't born to turn into be gay. Like even the most progressive LGBT plus scientists have been correcting the movement by pointing out that no one is born gay. No one is born genetically determined to be gay. So so on that alone, you know, personally I think we can reject the idea that God misguided in the womb that he made us intending for us to experience romantic and sexual same-sex attractions. But you know, I kind of say this in the talk like even if we became convinced that sexual orientation is genetically determined. Like if some flood of new research outweigh the consistent data we have from the past you know decades of sexual orientation change research. Even if that were the case, that doesn't mean God intended for people to be gay. You know, God's intentions aren't a scientific question. There are theological one. And science can't answer the question God's intentions because none of us are how God made us to be none of us are born. How God first imagined us to be. We're all erupted at a dramatic level of our births, formed brokenly in the womb, quickly injured by the broken world we're born into. So then how do we answer that like the theological question on which science can't comment well, you know, it's my understanding that Romans one teaches that same-sex sexual desires are unnatural. That they're the broken that they're contrary to God's first intentions. So God doesn't intend for anyone to experience same-sex sexual or romantic attractions or engage in those kind of relationships. But yeah, we don't choose who we're attracted to. So yeah, to be clear as well, like I don't, I don't think God like cursed us with being gay or something like that. I think some people misread Romans one to think like, oh, these people looked at straight porn. So God, punter send by giving them the gayness. I don't know, I don't know. That's what our work's written. Unfortunately, I thought that was how it worked when I was like 10 years old and there's unfortunately many clients I met with, they thought that that's what Romans one meant. So that's a little bit of a deal. But clearly we're gay, right? I'm gay. Josh is gay, we gay. Oh, I'm joking. So at the very least, God allowed it, right? So if it's not, we've got intent. And it's broken. But God allowed it and it's not his will to change it for the vast majority of people. And what gives? Like, that doesn't fare. And like, for me, this is where we get into like the general question of evil, like that territory. Like, why does God allow painful things to happen to people? Well, it's an honor really no. They answer to that question. Many people, much, much smarter than me haven't been able to find the most satisfying enough interest of that question. But I can at least share with helpful for me. And then I'll quit chatting here. You're going to go in the way. So yeah, that's what you know, so okay. So the question of why does God allow painful things happen to innocent people? Generally, I think that God lets painful things happen. Because in one way or another, all pain is due to the sinful choices of someone. Now, often, it's not due to the sinful choices of ourselves. Often, the pain we experience in our life is due to the sinful choices of others. Recently, we're going all the way back to Adam, right? We experience pain because others have sinned. But because God wants our love to mean something, we need to have real choice. But for our capacity to choose to be real, like, to have to be consequences. If God just swooped in and undied the consequences of our decisions, or the consequences of other people's decisions, our choices wouldn't mean anything. So, at least as I understand it, like, in order to preserve our capacity to choose, God refrains from protecting us from the consequences of our decisions and the decisions of others often. Usually, that's his ammo. So, then I find this helpful to apply it to my own sexuality. I believe romantic and sexual scenes, sexual scenes are broken. And my hunch is, I develop same sex attractions because of generations of sin in the church and in my family. And in my own experience as growing up. And then this is borne out in genes and environmental factors. Like, I think I develop same sex attraction because of the sins of others. So, what God have preferred to block the consequences of the sins of others and protect me from the pain this broken is his cause. Me, absolutely. Like, I believe that is what God would prefer for me. But, I think, like, preserving those people who committed those sins, preserving their capacity to have real choice and human kinds capacity to have real choice is even more important to God. Because it means our love for each other and our love for God actually means some. So, he allowed the consequences of the sins of others to remain. He allowed me to develop same sex attraction and it doesn't seem to be his will to change anything about that. Yeah, I know this is not very comforting. Like, that's a pretty sucky story. It may be felt soffically satisfying, but it's not emotionally satisfying at all. It's really emotionally disturbing. So, so what I hold on to at the end of that for me is, well, I do have promises in Scripture that God seeks to redeem all painful things for my good in his glory. And I can't explain it all, but I do know that like, a vast majority of all the most beautiful things I've experienced in this life has been in the context of making sense of the fact that I'm gay. Making sense of it with other gay people, making sense of it with straight people, making sense of it with my church and with my parents and with my friends. Like, I found my life purpose and mission in making sense of my story and helping others make sense of their story and helping the church be a place where the next generation of gay Christian kids don't experience this. It's don't experience the same pain that I did. So, I absolutely see how God is making good on this pain for my good in his glory. So, anyway, that was a very long-winded response to your question, but that's what it goes for me. Yeah. Well, it's a complicated topic, you know, so obviously. Because I think sometimes when we get into this conversation about being gay or, you know, or the origins of sexuality and all this stuff, we get into so many of these intersection places of deep systematic theology on God's will. And I am not a systematic theologian. I more do Hebrew studies, so obviously I know that there's different words for different kinds of God's will and I don't pay attention. And I'm also not a Calvinist, so I did not pay attention to that. And so, but then also on top of that we get into science and we get into psychology and all these things. And I think sometimes it gets very hard because as you said, there's a thing of like, Well, God, we are gay, so somehow God allows us. And yet he's not surprised. Yeah. I think it's a good change if he really wanted to. He can pretty much change anything he wants to. And so he says, no, he's deciding not. So there must be some reason why. And I think I love Becka kind of mentioned this a little bit in one of her talks at Revoys. Is that kind of saying God obviously has me being LGBT for a reason, you know. And yet also understanding of the whole entire thing of, there are a lot of factors that play into that. Whether that's God's will of what has happened versus what his will of what he would intend to happen. And I think also we sometimes get into this mindset as modern people that I don't think occurred in the mind of people during biblical times. As this separation of God's intent in genetics versus God's intent in environment. Because I think sometimes we get into this very big mindset of like, if it happens in your genetics, oh God like just ordained it and done versus like if it happened in an environment, it's like, well, that's that humans and obviously there's all of these different factors and I think it's God has his hand over over all of this in some way. And we play a partner obviously as you said, you know, are we play a partner by. By the way that we influence people and we influence other people and are very fallenness influences other people as well. Our brokenness influences others. Yeah. Well, and I get add one little thing to make sure that I don't step in it, right? The other the other, another element that just added onto this whole conversation is there's there's points in some of the things I said that seems as a time. And I'm not going to really close to the like the the ugly pit of sidax right to one side of myself. And so that's also the trickiness of this right because like, I don't think I don't think any gay people did anything to make themselves gay. Yeah, I don't think it's sinned anyway and that's why they're gay, right? So I want to be just super super super clear. And also why these these conversations are difficult because even just talking even just denying the idea that we are born gay sounds like a sidax thing. Even though today LGBT scientists are saying people aren't born gay, right? But that sounds like a sidax thing. So this again, the reason why this is so triggering these conversations are triggering for people is that so many things just remind us of the jargon and the arguments and the phrases that sidax has did a tunnel. And and they and people can't really listen to what you're saying because they just get they just get turned off because they hear a couple of these phrases that that's this seem familiar in a painful way. Yeah, and I think that I think that's a really good clarification. Thank you for that. Because I think that it does get it does get freaked out like for many people. But at the same time, like if we're going to acknowledge the sexual fluidity like pan sexuality, the fluidity within bisexuality, asexuality, we're acknowledging that sexuality is much more complex than whether you're straight or gay. It's so much more complex than that. And if we're going to acknowledge that sexuality is much more complex than that, we are definitely acknowledging that it is much more complex than a simple gay gene. That's just how it is. I mean, look at the queer community. If it was simply a just a gay gene, we would not have so much fluidity within gender and sexuality represented within the community. Sure, get something that you really you did in your talk. I thought was really, really helpful. And I think you did it just now to for you, you sort of use a couple words and then you define those words very specifically before moving on. So I think in your talk, you define being gay as experiencing sexual attraction. And then you define same sex attraction as same sexual attraction, just for the purposes of the talk. So I think in the side B world, there's a lot, there's a lot of different ways of speaking about these things and not everyone uses those words the way you did in that in that talk. And so that can lead to a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding, but I thought that was super helpful. So with that in mind, I think one of the questions that people had about your talk more specifically was, is there anything about being gay that is not a burden, but something beautiful, not like a thorn, but more of a flower. Is there something that that we uniquely have as queer people that is a good thing and not just a struggle. Yeah, so yeah, you and you just you kind of just stated that we all have different definitions how we use these words. And precision is important, but maybe it would be great if we were all like at the UN and we all have little translate. And then it was just translated into the words they would use to describe that thing. Yeah, yeah, it's okay Peter, I'll be I'll be your quote unquote anger translator. I'll just translate everything you say into my language and then that'll that'll facilitate the whole dialogue. I'll just hear a circle around you when everything. Yeah, I mean, basically what we talking about is how do we how do we translate an any of your aim to a person with feelings right how do we like. Without getting turned off. I think there's a lot of money to do. And you'll you'll be sitting pretty. So to your question, right. Yeah, I tend to think that all there is, you know, inherently and lately universally uniquely to being gay are same sex attractions. Like I don't think there's some special capacity for friendship or aesthetics and stability that like travels with the gaging or part of the gaging set for all people. I think that most of what we actually experience as being gay is culturally created. It is constructed and hard earned from the experience of being gay in a certain context. And those things are good and beautiful. Like for example, I do think that side be gay Christians develop a unique capacity for an appreciation of deep or friendship because of our experiences. You know, we're forced by our circumstances to learn to do friendship better. So is there anything inherently and inherently universal unique to gay people that existed prefall. You know, we can only really speculate about like prefall human existence is what those were like. But what we do know today is there's not doesn't seem like there's much more than same sex attraction that isn't inherent in a universal uniquely gay. And I don't think that romantic or sexual same sex attractions were prefall, you know, at least how I define those things. And so it seems like there isn't anything prefall to being gay. I think some of what you're getting out of your question. I think what the better question is for gay people is what from the gay experience will remain in the new Jerusalem. Because we weren't made for the garden. We weren't made for Eden. We were made for the new heavens and the new earth. We were made for the city. So I think it matters like much more what we will be there than what we would have been in a never fallen garden. Yeah. And you know, at least as icy even coming from a more maybe conservative in some ways perspective on these things. The the scar from Christ wins on the cross could still be singing on his resurrected body. Like these physical signs of our sin that Christ took on those physical signs of our redemption through Christ sacrifice. They remain because they were a sign of God's glory, not of shame. So I think in the same way like a Christian who's gay, I think will continue to have an awareness of the fact that they're gay and appreciation of the fact that they were gay in this life. I think they'll continue to have that in the new heavens and the new earth because it was particularly through that experience that God was most glorified for those people. And and particularly three that experience that the most good came to the lives of gay Christians has certainly been my story, right. If somehow like I had like gay amnesia when I then the new heavens and the new earth and I forgot that I was gay or anything to do with gay. You're basically raising all the best parts of my life, right. So you know, I think we're than people though maybe bristle at this is okay, but like does that mean they'll be division in the new heavens and the new earth. And I think one of the differences between now and the new Jerusalem is right now while differences in this life bind some together more closely. It divides from others. What will be beautiful and different about the new heavens and the new earth is is our awareness of this common experience will continue to bind us to something but will not divide us from any. Yeah, that's really good. What is that remains? I have no idea. What exactly that is that is redeemed and is purified and is I have no idea. But it makes sense to me that there'd be something. Yeah, I. I really love that you said that you know, I was talking to a side B person and I really love what they said is like, you know, many times we try to emphasize to straight questions, you know, marriage is not going to be in in in you know, the new Jerusalem. So you're going to be like me and he's like, but also we have to remember that singleness is not going to remain in the new Jerusalem for the very reason of the very word single. No one is going to be independent. We are all going to be disconnected. So singleness and marriage are both going to be wasted away in the new Jerusalem because no one's going to be their own unit separate from everyone else. We will all be equally joined together as the body of Christ and therefore joined to our groom in a way that we can understand at this moment because we have that capacity to be can more connected to some than to others. And it's just something that doesn't seem like it's going to be that way and have an I never really thought about it that way. It's like, wow, so we we really won't be single using that term in the sense of being divided from other people the same way we won't be married elevating one relationship over the others. We're going to have this unique bond where all people bringing as you said our experiences and I love what you said about that because it's really important we cannot focus on eating but focusing on the new Jerusalem because there are things from this world that weren't any in that are going to be taking into the new Jerusalem we see that in Revelation. We see that true and and I will admit as someone who like for me many times thinking about being LGBT and thinking about that's relationship to eat that relationship to eat and versus the new Jerusalem. It's hard for me sometimes because I see so much beauty from my experience as an LGBT person that it's that hard to think about that. I think that's really in relationship to eat and whether or not that there are some connection there but I definitely do love what you're saying is that there are without a doubt parts of our experiences because they are the parts of our experiences that draw us to God regardless of whether they were an eating will be carried over into the New Jerusalem because it's it's the very part of our walk that drew us towards him. You have to say sometimes it's uncomfortable for me to think about like oh well you know I was fascinated in Greg Cole's book when he kind of theorized about this idea of like wood LGBT people have been different than straight people in the garden had there never been a fall. And that fascinated me I do not have theological grounds for it obviously because we don't have anything from it. But I think we all cling to this idea of wanting to know that there is something of our of our experience that comes from God's intent. But regardless of what God's intent was God definitely uses our experiences and and our lives to draw us to him. Yeah I think side be side be land side be people can disagree on how to frame what parts of our experience. Some what I think regardless it's really helpful for different perspectives to the New Jerusalem because the New Jerusalem is going to be better than the garden. We're not we're not having we're not sort of doing a return to the business that even for moving forward to an even greater good. We we go from a garden to a city so I think that's such a helpful. Yeah, because we can we can have this agreement that I think by and large a lot of us agree on some of the basics that some of the more superficial things we can we can articulate differently but yeah that shift is this is helpful. Yeah, I think that's good and I think that's really good and something I want to share with everyone listening is you know all of y'all out there listening. You know one of the biggest things that we do on this podcast is we acknowledge the fact that there are there are things that side be people have different perspectives on whether it comes to theology whether it comes to how we live out our lives but there is a core that we agree on and. So there may be parts of this conversation that you may not agree with and that's part of these conversations because we have to have discussions you know. And it's important to continue growing Peter and I disagree all the time and we. It's great it is fun he's my light and my life that we also argue and y'all if anyone out there does not have a family where you don't disagree please text me because I want to know how that happened. Yeah, please explain to me how that works. Well then one last question before we go is you know another and another part of the talk you addressed the argument of there being bad fruit on the traditional theology. And you said one of the main bad fruits of affirming theology is that it can be a slippery slope to losing faith and I know that this was also a part of tension for some people say be people listening and obviously affirming people listening but what would you say to those who disagree with that statement. So I emphasized this in the talk but I'll say I think it's good to say here again that like this has not been everyone's experience. I'm not claiming to know what what has been true for all people and I also like while I do think it is a slippery slope I'm not I wish it wasn't a slippery slope like I wish I saw. Side eight gay Christians holding on to their faiths thriving in their relationships with God and in kind of you know gay marriages. So much that like I questioned whether side B is really how God thinks about sexual ethics like I wish that was the case. Because I want good things for my gay Christian friends who have a progressive psychological effect but that hasn't been my consistent experience and and every time I share. About this slippery slope that I see including sharing at re-voice over and over again I get gay and straight people who connect with me afterwards and say oh I've seen that too and it makes me cry and I also feel like I'm not allowed to say it. So it's tricky right you know to give you just like one concrete example for example. You know in college I knew about 20 gay Christian guys in my Christian fraternity and of those 13 are still Christian and they are side B. Five of those went side A and are professing atheists now. One I'm not sure where he's at and then the last one is side A and professes to be a Christian but if I asked him whether he would kind of profess a historical understanding of the nice and creed and reject anything mutually exclusive with a nice and creed he would not be willing to do that. That's just 20 people in one space right I know that to make this claim most robustly I would need a standardized survey of a thousand random gay Christians right I don't have that but six out of six moving from side A to non Christian and 13 out of 14 at least staying side B and remaining Christian like that's that's meaningful evidence that's that's why I'm so convinced of this. That's how it's powerful for me and when I talk to people that's not inconsistent with other people's experiences but I want to add one one other things. It's a little bit more personal about why I'm convinced of a traditional sexual ethic and I don't always include this because over the past seven years of a full time ministry I realize that it can hurt mean to use my own story as a prop. I think that's not a good thing if not audience is straight. It can feel like I'm I'm tokenizing myself and that's not good for me. But because I know the audience of this podcast is mostly queer I think it's something good for me to share here. It's when also really convincing for me. Has been the bad fruit of my own experiences with a perceptual ethic. I felt like I heard from the enemy for years and years and years that got to if you just had a romantic relationship with the man everything would be better. Just had a sexual relationship with the man everything would be better and I finally have everything I need it. And I wish I could have just trusted God that the enemy slides were lots but I couldn't like I had to test them for myself and I made plenty of mistakes. And my own experiences have been that romantic and sexual relationships with men were not everything I hope they would be like they were painful. They were not as good as promise and while I'm not experienced everything under the sun like I cannot say a thwartatively that I know from experience that nothing would satisfy me. I can't say that. But one experience is just about the clearest contrast between sin and beauty that I could ask for when I was in a particularly dark place in college. I was connecting romantically sexually with another guy and despite the fact that I was doing the things that movies told me would make me feel more connected and loved and known than anything else. I felt so alone and and then after we stopped the reality of what we had just done set in and we sat there on the floor leaning against the wall shoulder to shoulder and we started crying both of us were crying. And mixed in with the crying we both verbalized what we were feeling. We shared how empty both of us felt how lonely we felt how messed up this world was and disconnected from God. We felt how confused we were the God would let us be this way and yet connections like we just shared and feel right. And and I didn't feel lonely anymore. I didn't suddenly I didn't feel disconnected anymore. You see the romantic and sexual connections that the enemy promised would satisfy me while those failed. But then in stark contrast to that the two of us confessing to each other and crying out to God together satisfied us more viewed in satisfied us and and felt more beautifully intimate than anything we had shared before. Yeah, even if I could convince myself logically of a progressive sexual ethic even if you know that fear that adopting a progressive sexual ethic might lead to someone losing their faith even if we could dismiss that. Like personally I couldn't get past the bad food I've seen personally in my own way. I don't share that say that like every gay person out there should go make lots of mistakes to convince themselves about traditional sexual ethic. I wish I hadn't made mistakes I did I plead with like friends and counseling clients to to learn from I'm a stakes and not have to test that themselves. But yeah, that's that's been what's convinced me for me. Yeah, I think that's that's really helpful context for for that section of your talk. I know we've talked a little bit about this behind the scenes but I haven't exactly had the same experience in talking with my my side a. Friends, I know several of them have really strong spiritual lives. But yeah, I definitely understand like moving from from side to unaffirming position on in sex sexuality. There's a lot of deconstruction that happened. And so something that struck me as you were talking. In addition to the point you were making about they're being possibly that fruit is often times I think side B people when a friend goes side A and sort of take several steps back and just sort of disengage. And so the unfortunate side effective that is that side A people are suddenly left without the Christian community to the need. And it sort of contributes to feeling like faith is just radically shifted for them. So in thinking about my my friendship with my side A friends, so I love dearly. I've just been so blessed to continue our relationship with them even though we don't see eye to eye on that more. Yeah, it's this this slippery slope argument is an interesting one for me because I will admit I've had friendships with people on both sides of this like person like situation like I have friends who are affirming who have. Sometimes I feel like stronger faith than I do and then I will have friends who in the process of deconstructing you know their faith related to sexuality deconstruct their faith entirely. And I remember even one time with one friend who I had like been arguing on their behalf against the slippery so argument and then they ended up deciding that they weren't a longer Christian even going to them being like I have been arguing for you and you are proving the point that I'm trying not. I'm not arguing against and being very frustrated with them like I'm you're trying to support you and you're not helping me. And I think in general I'm just not a fan of slippery so arguments and I don't think it's about this specifically it's about like I've had people argue this slippery so argument about side A is I be being to side A and this look like so argument of people saying sell with the partnerships leading to affirming or like. All these different kind of things where I'm like no I don't necessarily see that and so I personally I think just in general in arguments try to stay away from from slippery slope arguments but. I do understand what you're saying because I have had similar experiences with what you are conveying Peter and I want to say thank you so much for sharing about your personal you know experience. I think it's something that is really really great for people to hear because obviously it I think our experiences play such an important role in what leads us to where we are at you know. I don't know if you're doing something like that. I just want to say this and if you all have any pushback on this please feel free to do so. I think it is important to acknowledge that there are some side people that separate the morality of romantic attractions and sexual attractions. Because and I'm not saying that I necessarily have solidified thoughts on that I just know that that is something that is real for some side people and. And I mean honestly I can I can share from my own life of someone who has been in a period of committed relationship in affirming relationship and sometimes it's hard when you come from a. From having a relationship where there was great things shared in a romantic sense and then trying to make sense of once your theology changes going wait so it's bad but I had a really good experience. And trying to make sense then of how something that you experienced so great. Can all of the sudden be maybe not so great according to the theology that you hold and so. I think with that I just not that we need to go into that discussion because I know that that's another tend to a point that can lead into a whole rabbit trail of talks. But I also wanted to acknowledge for anyone listening that there is that understanding that happens for some people and but if you guys have any thoughts on that feel free to share. I know I don't want conversation definitely worth some time when it can be addressed thoroughly. Here point of you know even. You know setting aside people beliefs about romance even if. The kind of same sexual aspect of of a same sex relationship isn't God's best like that's not to say that all of the rest there wasn't beauty there. And with with any of these people that I've unfortunately crossed boundaries with and send against myself and send against them and that a lot of them those began as friendships that were really awesome like I. I love these men in all the. The pierists and best ways and so that's some of the reasons why the sin the sin that I committed the sins that they committed were so painful because the enemy succeeded in convincing me to spoil something so good. And for most of those people that I cross boundaries with for all of them at least wounded the friendship deeply and for most of them in a way that could never be repaired so yeah I. There there is good in those relationships and in some ways that's why I feel so strongly about. Traditional sex. And avoiding. These things that God says is not best for us is because I don't want to. So good and beautiful. I want to keep absolutely so yeah I agree with that 100%. Well that is it for the episode today.
