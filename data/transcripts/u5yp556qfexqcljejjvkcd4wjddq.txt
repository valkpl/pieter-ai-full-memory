 Hello and welcome to Solid D. I'm really excited about today's guest from the equipped team. I think that's a great way to introduce you. Peter, can you introduce yourself and tell my listeners who you are? Maybe even tell them why you reached out to me to be on my podcast, which is sort of funny that's never happened to be before actually. Hey, Bridget. Yeah. Glad to be here. Thanks for having me on the podcast. Yeah, a little bit about me and then I'll tell a funny story about how shameless I am about social media and why. The shameless methods are necessary. But yeah, a little bit about me. My full-time job is help running a ministry called Equip, which is the premier consulting and training solution for churches who aspire to me places where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic. I'm also a licensed professional counselor, so I meet with some clients in private practice who are exploring similar questions about a half day week. And then I am a founding brother of the Nashville family of brothers, which is a place for men and Nashville who call to singleness for the sake of the kingdom to find permanent lived in human family. So that's pretty cool. And then increasingly, I at least hope to be involved in helping Christians think better about discernment between vocational, singleness and Christian marriage. And that's how I got connected with Bridget here because like two or so years ago, I pitched a manuscript for a book about discerning between celibacy and marriage in young adult years to some Christian publishers. And the response I got back was we love your book, but we love for you to have more followers so that it's a less risky endeavor for us. So I for the past two years, then I've been pretty intentional about connecting with people on social media who have similar kind of interest and and as a rule, if someone follows me or likes one of my posts and I see a post to podcast, I shoot them a message and say, hey, we'd love to come on the pod. So I'm glad that Bridget responded and we get to have conversation because, yeah, this has been fun getting to know you Bridget and I'm so like jazz about the ways that you're getting to tell your story about, you know, singleness for the Lord and the ways that you're helping Christian young adults think better about this. So yeah, so glad to be here. Yeah, thank you so much and you and I actually probably have this in common. We wear a lot of hats. It seems like can't just stick to one thing apparently, but that's fine. That's I think part of me we can talk about it a little bit because getting to talk to the other day, realizing that you're really passionate about using your station in life to serve others and do the most I feel like, which is like great, you know. But yeah, I think it's interesting. I have sort of shared about my book with my listeners. I have no idea at this point or not if they're like sick of it or excited about it. But I started the podcast because I didn't want to write my book and then I don't know if it was just like the pandemic and I've been talking about it too long. And I just felt like I had extra time. It definitely went ahead and hand with like a loan the year season in my life that I was like, well, I have time, you know, I'll write this book. I just got lucky that I have like a back door into university press. And so because I don't have even as many followers as you and the influencer life is like not my jam, but I will say at the beginning of my book as I am inviting people to go on this pilgrimage into holy aloneness as the subtitle is. I make it really clear what my book is and what it isn't. And like my book isn't prescriptive of like this is what singleness needs to look like or here's the lessons you need to be learning and the journey you need to be going on. It's more like here's my journey and and the fact is my stories and my experience is limited. I think like gosh, I feel like I've one of the most privileged experiences of singleness in in every sense, you know, I think like. Yeah, my life's comfortable. I am surrounded. I'm so resource and then yeah, I'm straight. So I don't have like. That extra thing to like worry about or have to sift through and for a long time in my life, it's been really important to. Journey with my friends in their own. Their journey like this is why I really like that we've landed on pilgrimage is sort of like a friend for my book because. To walk alongside my friends who may have different experiences of singleness and be like, yeah, you know what I'm experiencing is not totally like going to sound right for you or whatever. You know, not to make it to like there's everyone has their own path. I don't know you know what I'm saying. I'm not trying to do too much of that, but I do think that there's so many experiences of singleness. There's even like. I feel like I was talking to somebody maybe it was just my editor recently. It's like everyone single at one point and then they possibly and probably like half of them are single again. Like whether it's through divorce or death, you know, and like yeah, there just isn't enough resource for them. And so why I was really excited that you reached out to me was after you know doing a quick stalking of you. I was like, yes, because these are things that I can't speak to with expertise when it comes to LGBTQ singleness. I know the stories my friends and their own struggles. And even their joys, but like yeah, I'm not going to try to speak to something that I can't. And so anyway, thanks for reaching out and I'm excited for your voice to be heard and at the end will make sure people can know where to find you because this book will happen. I know it Peter. We'll see. I don't know if I can promise to be an expert, but I at least have experiences and opinions. So. Well, I mean just talking about what you're starting or being a part of a clip and then this the Nashville band of brothers and then that you're a counselor. I think those are really great things. And so I think you have something to offer us. Yeah, I would love to hear a little bit of your story. You know, whatever you feel like sharing that you feel like would be helpful to people and why have you landed in this place because I think I feel like an outsider honestly. I mean like an a way I'm an outsider to LGBTQ. Hopefully a friend, but like what I know is that people all over the place with their sexual ethic, you know, and you mentioned a couple times already Christian marriage or traditional like Christian sexuality. That kind of thing. So even if you want to give us some like definitions. And then why have you landed there as opposed to like. I see as like seems to be more common, which is like living out people living out their sexuality as it is expressed in them, you know, freely and being a Christian. So. Yeah, so when I say kind of traditional sexual ethic. So how I understand the church has historically understood the scriptures to teach is that God's best for most Christians is either a lifetime vocation of abstinence singleness for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention. More a lifetime vocation of Christian marriage between one woman and one man, one Christian woman and one Christian man with an openness to the important work of raising children for the sake of the kingdom. So that's what I understand a traditional sexual ethic to be is that those those those two things are God's best for his people. And and it's wise us for me to pursue those to seek those of the blessings that God wants to offer. The short and sweet of how kind of I've arrived where I'm at is grew up in a Christian home that taught a traditional sexual ethic of sorts realized I was gay. I continue to be convinced that the the Bible was how I know knew who God was and how he thought about these things and what his wisdom was for me and it seems seem to me at least that the scripture was clear enough on these topics. And then it kind of through college was a part of the campus ministry and a Christian fraternity where I got to share more of my story and do life with other men who were gay and Christian and committed to a traditional sexual ethic. And I you know went through my own today we would call it deconstruction perhaps went through my own sense of kind of like my even jylocal Protestantism that I was a part of that I identified with kind of falling apart from the inside. I'll roll along the fundamental questions of is the Bible self evident if it's not self evident if it requires a human interpreter than what human interpreter or interpreters do I trust and to God give to Jesus give the authority the responsibility to interpret scripture to certain people and has that been passed down to certain other people over the past 2000 years so anyway. By the end of college I felt called to to be involved in kind of full-time ministry supporting people like me and in particular I had been doing life with with a lot of gay, celibate Christians and college and realize that all of us were afraid that we would be alone. If we followed God's wisdom and then of us had parents or pastors who knew how to minister to us well. We knew what to do with this so. In many ways that started kind of the two big projects that I'm involved in today so. I did a fellowship at Gordon comwell theological seminarian by the end of that was convinced that God was calling you to start a ministry. I was a ministry based in Nashville that would equip parents and pastors to better minister to gay people according to a traditional sexual ethics so that got started seven years ago. And then by that time on a personal level you know I continue to be convinced of a traditional sexual ethic I now had. I was now convinced in more complex ways that that was true that was how God thinks about these topics and that was God's best for me more complex more true ways than than how I thought about it as a middle school or obviously. And certainly I've had my doubts and certainly I've made plenty of mistakes I've not have not lived up to my kind of. I said I said no in moments of weakness to the best things God has to offer and yes to thing to lesser things plenty of times so I don't want to I don't want to you know suggest some kind of perfection or or that this is by any. But yeah I'd say in college I because I was gay and Christian and committed to a traditional sexual ethic I thought a lot study the lot about what the Bible has to say about singleness. Also because I was in a Christian fraternity and bigger Christian fraternity forced me to go on date events and invite girls and I was and I was transparent about my sexuality. I kind of accidentally ended up dating a couple of girls longer term because well hey you know I'm gay but I think you're pretty cool and that date was fun do you want to go on another and. I think that led to you know eight nine month long relationships where I fell in love with a couple of these women and to develop kind of a specific desire for some of them so why I'm not like generally. I'm not not by sexual and not generally attracted to women I like develop this this attraction to a couple of specific women so anyway it's all to say that by the time I got a college I knew that. Singleness for the Lord some version of that was an option for me I knew that Christian marriage was also an option for me could work you know. But it just seemed clear to me I can't explain it in any other way other than the Holy Spirit made clear to me I wasn't supposed to just choose which of those I preferred and go take that. I was supposed to ask God which would be better for me. I was supposed to ask God did he have a preference for which gift he wanted to give me. And then to seek out that gift regardless of whether it was my preference. And yeah that that led to kind of like an accidental discernment process two three four years after that the conclusion of which is that I felt called. I did feel confident confidently that God was calling into this lifetime abstinent single list for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention but I knew I still needed lived in lifelong human family through that well I'd not receive some special gift of cellulosee that that men all I knew was was my Bible and my journal and my CCM music tunes on my on my on my iPhone. And so that like long story short led to the formation of the Nashville family of brothers which is the the kind of quasi monastery the intentional Christian community that that I'm living today. As a place to find hopefully a lifelong lived in family so yeah that's a bit about me and and and and where I'm at these days of how I got there and and and what I believe. Yeah that's really cool. I think I appreciate seeing that it's. Not so cut and dry it's not black and white like it's there's nuance and there's even like your own journey to exploring what does it look like. It's also just encouraging that like the consistent thing throughout it all for you is like sort of this unshakable faith and the gospel and like what that means for your life and so I love that you know I didn't originally start solar as like a Christian podcast but. Like if you type in single this when you are looking for podcasts is usually and this is only changed recently but it's usually sermons and so. It is just kind of a Christian topic in a way at least in America and but shout out to my international listeners they I've got some groups all over the place that. They're fun and I'm like how did you find this but all that to say you know. This is another thought I do feel like the world looks to what is going on in America and even in the church no matter. What's an omination like whatever culturally is happening and I've just experienced that in my travels and like talking to people. But overall I just felt like man there's not enough positive encouraging content about single this and so like wanting to be committed to offering that. But I'm the same like I since I was three like I just love Jesus and there's nothing more convincing to me than the story of God in the Bible now like traditional Christian sex ethic I. I'll just this is like my own you know like confession of where I'm at I agree with it but I also I always have questions you know and so and I haven't gone to seminary like and I've taken to you know theology classes. So I guess I have gone to seminary but not not much and so the ends and outs of it. I'm still I'm still in the middle of that and so like I'm really encouraged by your own. Clarity and like desiring to offer that to other people too but it also it sounds like you hold space for people when they're wherever they're at you know to keep encouraging them towards God's best for them and I love that so. And that's just like when I'm hearing from your story. I think definitely where where I empathize is that. So you know one I'll say it's not it's not been it's not been it's certainly not been it's. If I believe a God exists and that God knows best what is good for me. And the way I know that God is from the Bible and the Bible and the church the church and the scriptures then it's for me it's it's pretty. I'm pretty convinced at least on an intellectual level that a traditional sexual I think is true. Yeah. So for individuals who aren't convinced of those three things I said previously then it may would make sense why they would doubt that a traditional sexual I think is least it's true but. You know this is something is really true it should lead to goodness and beauty. And that's the problem is that for most people most least gay people who live out a traditional sexual ethic it does not lead to goodness and beauty it leads to bad and ugly. And so I think rightly that leads gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic to doubt is this really true. Yeah. And so I definitely empathize with it makes sense to doubt whether not a traditional sexual ethic is true because it's something is really true it should be good and beautiful. I think the way we make sense of why is this true but but painfully ugly is because our churches have done such a poor job of teaching about what God's wisdom for everyone's sexual stewardship really is. Yeah. I'm sure it's an a bad job of preventing the wounds of the closet our churches have done a bad job of offering anyone called to singleness for the Lord lifetime lifelong lives in human family our churches have done a poor job in body and traditional sexual ethic in ways that gay people could actually. Take hold of that and and and thrive in good and beautiful so it makes hold of sense to me why why gay people why queer people would would doubt whether traditional sexual ethic is true. And and and you know for me I have I have plenty of doubts actually as about whether God exists that that's the bigger question for me which we can go have a whole longer conversation about that. Yeah, but but at least when I when I'm convinced or I choose to believe I act as if I'm I have faith that God exists. And then I think it's it's got to forget the verse reference but the kind of well to whom where else will I go Lord. Which you know I feel like there's so many different ways we can read that particular verse but sometimes I feel like. What what I what I want that that that phrase that sentence to mean is that like well God there aren't really great options and following you is the least that option. And I'd be a fool to choose one of the other lesser ones yeah. But that's still in good. Yeah. That's how I feel a lot of days I don't like that I I. I hesitate to to judge if you and else for not being willing to choose that. And I am really convinced that it's still the best option available that the other paths are even more painful even less good even less beautiful. But but but that's hard and and sometimes life is so painful that we don't want to really think about what will be good and beautiful in the long term we just want something that will come for us right now and that makes it. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I mean I think this is what is the. Radical and tricky and hard invitation or like. Belief that we hold that like a life fully surrendered to Jesus as Lord is like the best life and like. How do we convince people. Yeah, you know when they're so. I'm a little bit like I think the peeling back the layers of think theology I think I was taught not even blatantly but just like over time of like. What it means to like have desires as of human like am I allowed to you know and and I again I say this totally poor privilege in every way that I can muster. I. I. Still felt like I was being told that my desires are wrong like like quickly after desire came shame within the church and so. All the things you're saying like the church has you know one of my one of my episodes I think it might have been first season is like where the church has gone wrong on seeing on this. Well, I had I hadn't even covered the whole story right like I just kind of started to talk about it but all those things that you're mentioning like. Even for. People who. Like like basically everyone else I guess like people who feel comfortable in church I still feel like they're not equipped with a beautiful vision for their lives and their sexuality either like every heterosexual person or. I mean it's just so many different experiences people are having but the church doesn't teach us enough and I think. There's a lot of reasons for that see that feels like a podcast series. Oh yes yes yes. Okay so to maybe to zoom out a little bit and and I we might disagree here a little bit well maybe we don't necessarily disagree I just I know you and I use the word romance differently which we didn't you or not. But you know I think that gay Christians at least attempting to steer their sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic or the canary in the coal mine. And and for your listeners I've been I've I've used this analogy canary in the coal mine and I feel like it's a thing in our culture to use that analogy and I realized half people out there don't actually know what it means so it's not a very useful analogy. So here I'm going to explain the analogy and then give the analogy which it's probably approved I just shouldn't use it but anyway. I grew up in northeast Tennessee and there were coal mines you know within driving distance so I was familiar with least with this analogy in coal mines you know if there's a kind of a gasses that have been trapped within the rock that are poisonous and you tap into that it could expose everyone in the minds and kill them. But like you know all the the carbon monoxide poisoning you know commercials of how you can't see the carbon monoxide so you need these monitors in your house. Well canaries in the coal mine were essentially the olden days. Carbon monoxide monitors and essentially you'd take down with you the a canary in this cage and then if the canary dies on you that tell you know there's carbon monoxide and you run. So it's an early sign of a bigger problem. Yeah. So I think gay Christians attempting to sue their sexuality according to a traditional sexual electric are the canary and the coal mine there they're suffering the ways that they are not thriving. The symptom of a much larger problem and the much larger problem is our churches are offering the idle of romance as the solution to everyone's loneliness regardless of sexual orientation and it's not working for anybody. It's maybe obvious to us the ways it's not working for gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual electric. But but straight Christians are hurting to from the kind of chief solutions that our churches are offering to our our needs for intimacy and family and the body of Christ. And we need better solutions than just make gay people straight and straight people just go find your Disney channel romance and run off into the sunset. Yeah, yeah, I mean there's nothing you said that I disagree with on that I. You're. I guess my question followed question is like is that kind of why your view of what Christian marriage is like I mean I know the biblical part of it but. That it's like between a man and a woman kind of like and you said with an openness to raise up children. But like what about a marriage where they don't want to have kids is there something off about that or as marriage just for. Procreation like I the reason I'm like I don't totally love that definition is because there's many people who cannot have kids and. And women just struggle without a lot and I also think that as a woman in the church were offered a picture of what being a follower of Jesus is and it's so often just wife and mother which is like you know part of the other thing and. Regardless of romance like regardless of any kind of like romantic idolatry it's like kind of an idolatry of. Fitting into these specific roles you know and. But that's how you know you've done something right like that's how you know you're following God the right way and it doesn't sit well with me and so yeah I mean what do you say to that. I think that's totally fair. Being celibate not having kids. Is less costly for Christian men than it is for Christian women. It doesn't it's not supposed to be that way but like I least I've observed and I've certainly been told by other Christian women that. There that a lot more of what it means to be a faithful Christian woman is wrapped up on being. A wife and a mom and it's and it feels like a lot more lost by accepting to call this fellow to see or buy not having kids. So yeah definitely want to recognize some some differences there. Yeah, I think in my definition earlier of kind of Christian marriage. Some of my word choice was particular and I want to kind of point that out so one you know first what I'm talking about here is kind of as a rule. Kind of generally God's design for dot dot dot. Is for Christian marriage to be a lifelong marriage between a woman and a man with an openness to raising kids for the sake of the kingdom. So note that I say there I didn't say that they are bearing children for the sake of the kingdom. I said openness to raising children so raising children is also inclusive of of families that are infertile and choose to foster or adopt. So I am convinced and I think the scriptures are convinced and the church over the past two thousand years is convinced that the Christian marriage at least as rule much more often than not. It is healthiest when it's leaning into not the only aspect of Christian marriage. But the thing that particularly makes Christian marriage different than vocational singles. Is it is it is as a rule a place to raise kids for the sake of the kingdom. So it's obviously it's a call to to intimacy within that family within that partnership. Obviously it's a call to to image the love of God found within the Trinity between Christ and the church in beautiful ways. Obviously it's a source of beautiful good like life sustaining companionship all those things I don't think perviation raising children is more important than any of those things. So okay but if something it's something is true as a rule that also means there are exceptions to the rule. We talk about those kind of things philosophically so absolutely there are Christian marriages that God is giving them kind of peace and permission not to raise children. Now I don't think that's 25% of the time. Yeah because that you know just just you numerically when we talk about has a rule versus exception to the rule of territory it's probably different percentages than 75 25. So I can at least share that the marriages in my life that they kind of lean into this understanding of Christian marriage with that looks like for them is that. Is that they went into marriage knowing that that's much more likely than not that how God will be calling them to be faithful and their Christian marriage is to raise kids not as many kids as they could possibly get their hands on or or birth. But but but that their posture towards God is God we know at the point we know at one of the purposes of this vocation is. And we are not going to unthinkingly resist that or throw that away we're going to humbly come to you in in prayer and ask you God how are you calling us to faithfully win this. So. But yeah. If I was talking to two people who are dating and they want to get married because their Christians and they want to have sex and they want to have kind of a companion who's committed to them in a permanent way but they're like I don't want to have kids. And this is kind of a hard like a non starter. I think I would challenge them. Is God calling you to Christian marriage then. I don't know. But if the burnings happening Peter. Well, that's a whole other comments. I know Christian the in seven nine and I have I have as you know it will be surprised that strong opinions about. The proper interpretations of first Corinthians seven nine and I wrote a article about that for a father and magazine. So maybe we can put that in the podcast notes, but yeah I love to. Yeah, no you go ahead. No, I think like. So where you where you stand it's. It's really interesting and there's a lot of stuff coming from my mind about it. It's like I'm really glad that I mean. I'm sure there's ways you've been hurt like in the church and all that but. Like where you are right now. You know you have this confidence in the way you see things and and what you believe which. Like I don't know there's just something refreshing about that. It's not a defensive like this is just how it is you know or this is where everyone needs to land or anything but. I I think because I spend a lot of time thinking about seeing all this like. One of the things I've thought about and you know we can also do a follow up podcast some time too is to talk more. I I'm like okay well what if I don't end up getting married so like. I don't know like and I and I've actually tried to do this God are you giving me this gift of celibacy and and there's. No yes there it's it's not a yes. Which is so I struggle with that and the frustration I have with like okay so like why have you made me desire this thing and try to peel back the layers of like. What societies offered me what church culture in America's offered me but being like I still want. To be married. And I think in the purest way and then it's okay like it's not a bad longing right. But I'm like okay but what if I still don't though you know like and so who will I be and that's like a huge same in my book is like. Who will I be when I don't get the thing that I want and will I be having integrity will I be. This person of character will God still be number one or will I let it eat me alive you know like and destroy me. That my entire identity is based off of whether or not I get the thing that I most desire. And yeah I mean kind of just depends on the season of life if I'm feeling really like upset about my singleness or feeling like then whatever you know. It's great like. And my life is pretty great usually so I I feel like so lucky in that regard but I've tried to imagine alternate experiences and realities. So like for example like what if I'm like 38 which is only like six years and I'm like you know what I'm in a really stable position financially I'm good and I love to foster you know some kids and adopt but I don't have a husband with me. In my opinion I would like totally love to to do that or like in my opinion. How cool it would be if like your group your family this Nashville band of brothers were able to do something similar you know and I mean that might that's what I'm saying it might be like a whole other topic of like. But those are the questions that come up for me and my singleness of like if there is this. Rule or something I mean I think it's just sort of statistical that most people get married of kids but. I almost think about it like. Maybe because I am single I'm like how do I use my time and energy and resources to serve people and like not just for me like. And I'm not I don't know never thinks like that but. But then I'm like could it be in these other ways so like because it sounds like you're making a distinction between. Singleness like salobacy and is like well yeah you can't make. Children you know when you're like not in a marriage like a Christian marriage you can biological but like you know what I'm saying and then but like that's the difference because all the things that you said we're going to. about marriage you've also told me you get to experience in your family in this in this like committed. Group and I think that's awesome and a good distinction like. We as single people can can and should be able to have all the beauty and intimacy and connection and commitment that married people have. Yeah that may be the differences. Making children together. I don't know so anyway this is sort of a little bit of external process but. Totally makes sense so let me let me start with some statistics from the US Bureau of Labor and statistics. Great. Well I was I was working on a piece. About a year ago about. A singleness for the sake of the kingdom and and and. Do single people leaning into singleness for the sake of the kingdom actually have greater capacity for kingdom work in some ways. One way to look at that is to to ask how many hours does the average parent spend raising kids and how many hours does that take from their overall. life capacity for kingdom work. So anyway, Doug into some US Bureau of Labor and statistics. Data about a child rearing and back of the napkin math that essentially the average parent in America spends the equivalent of two decades. A 40 hour work weeks raising kids. And if the average American kind of their prime kind of working years on between 25 and 65 that's 40 years. So we're talking about here is that parents. Have. Kind of. Excuse me, those people who don't have kids and like I'm missing thinking particularly those were walking out vocational singleness for the sake of the kingdom have 50% more hours available for kingdom work other than raising kids. I want to make honor note raising kids very important kingdom. Yeah, it's not not not kingdom or it is important kingdom. Okay, but like. I think all of us have seen over the past two years when it was a politics when it comes to racial injustice when it comes to all of the kind of the wealth inequality and the poor care for our planet that these past two years has just made even more obvious. There is a lot of kingdom work that needs to be done in our world that that's not raising kids. Yeah, and I also know some parents who are really busy doing the important kingdom work of raising kids and they sometimes leave church and they feel ashamed. Because they are already exhausted from raising kids well and then they feel like there's a call from their church that then they need to be fixing wealth inequality and fixing racial injustice and fixing political division and caring for our planet and they're like, I don't know where else the house was to do with that. That's why we need people in vocational singles. Yeah, because it's not fair to there's a way that you and I can can can leverage all of our potential hours for kingdom work in a in a focused single minded way towards addressing racial injustice political division wealth inequality. Mental illness in our communities advocacy for immigrants and refugees, etc. And we can do that with a focus and with an intensity that our married friends faithfully raising children can't and and that's and that's beautifully different. So now. You brought the question of well, but what a single people want to foster an adopt well, I mean, I'm not that we don't have to look any further than everyone running nor orphanages for centuries. Well, we're not. So obviously the work of like, of of of finding and providing a home for those kids who have who are orphaned who have the least who are the least kind of a desired and privileged in our communities. Obviously is important kingdom and it's more historically that celebrates have done together. And so and it's actually something that guys in our community and the National Family Brothers has considered you know we're eventually as we grow going to live in kind of a string a single family homes and what would it look like for one of our homes of of of four to eight guys to to feel like they are all called to to participate in this work of of of fostering. And providing respite care, particularly those kids and those families that that that the system has the hardest time finding a fit for. Yeah, and and that we would and that would be part of our kingdom work. Now I know I Peter Volk I I don't think I'm called to that kingdom work myself. I would I would love can care for those kids poorly or I would have to do the kingdom work I'm already called to poorly in order to do that. You know I'm limited right live in a world of scarce I don't have more hours to give to that kingdom one yeah. But other guys in our community may be called to that so that I think is beautiful that is great. I think that's very different and I'm going to describe this just an extremes recognizing that then there's a whole spectrum in between these two extremes. I think these different than another extreme of a person who does not want to fool with a spouse. But wants to fulfill the American dream of having a house and 2.5 kids and a white picket fence and a nice car and and Instagram vacations every summer with their kids and that the perfect little like pictures of their children and two kids who are the exact same races them and yada yada yada yada yada yada. And then are just kind of adopting to kind of fulfill an American dream thing and to fit in. But it's not really about sacrificing. And eating a need in our society it's about consuming char kids as an accessory. I don't know if the best play for vocational singles. I don't know if I've ever seen it happen. Yeah, I can't even like think of a person like that. Because yeah deciding to have kids foster adopt kids such a big thing and such a big process that you really would have to like be committed in a lot of ways and so. Yeah, I you know this is my last question before we wrap up because I definitely think we should do another podcast sometimes in you do you help people discern if they should do vocational single this right is part of that discernment also helping them know like what do I do with my time. Like what are my passion about or like gifted and called to because you know like. Even even if like the way you're describing Christian marriage like has a very clear and cut like cut pathway which like we know life's more difficult than that. But like this the like I have all my time to give to or 50% more time to give to kingdom work. How do I even begin to know what to do because like you have clearly done some good work to know what things you're not supposed to be doing and what you do need to say s 2 and has really hard anything for a lot of people what do you say s 2 what do you say no to. Yeah, yeah, absolutely yeah, I think part of of discerning between vocational single listen Christian marriage is is asking if. kind of in your non to five job in your occupational vocation you call to some kind of work that. Would be particularly better saved serve by vocational single is or requires vocational single is. Or do your heart feel tug to the important kingdom work of raising kids for the sake of them. That's a great question to ask and and one of the things we do here in the national family of brothers is is one of the things that guys discern. And that is is how is got calling us and at least how we see it here in the national family brothers house got calling us to leverage our nine to five jobs for the sake of the kingdom most directly. That doesn't mean everyone is doing full time ministry work but that means that because we have lots of shared expenses. Because we are not raising children. Our our lives cost a lot less. And so we can do with getting paid a lot less. That's really out and we can take jobs that maybe maybe there aren't our economy doesn't really incentivize kingdom work. It doesn't reward kingdom work financially. But we can afford to get paid less so one of the books that we. That we most enjoy in our community and it comes as it comes to like what is a broader definition of kingdom work and how do we think about how can we think about that well. Is a book called kingdom calling by Amy Sherman. It is a great resource and so if there's anyone out there who's like what is kingdom work. If I'm not in full time ministry can I do kingdom work what does that look like how do I explore and investigate what kind of kingdom work I'm called to that book is is great. And my favorite page is she has this venn diagram about and and in the three circles is basically what what did the what are the needs and the brokenness is in the pains in the world around us. What are the the kind of the solutions that that guide wants to bring to those pains and needs and brokenness is. And then what are our skills and what are our and what do we feel drawn to. Yeah and then where's the intersection between those three for us. That's a good hunch of the kingdom worth we might be called to that's called but yeah and then I say more generally on this question of like discernment how do we discern anything as Christians. There's lots of different kind of traditions of Christian discernment but Ignatian discernments probably the oldest and the most kind of formalize and if you've ever met with a spiritual director or heard of the idea spiritual director a lot of that is based in Ignatian discernment Ignatian spirituality and a great book that. Is very accessible to people who are not Catholics about Ignatian discernment is called God's voice within by Mark Tibido I definitely recommend people grab that book if they'd like to explore like what's what's like Christian discernment sounds so amorphous how how do I do it. That book is a great place to start so yeah I'd say reading those books two books together God's voice within by Mark Tibido kingdom calling by Amy Sherman you know I can provide no guarantees that you will feel clarity at the end of reading those two books of what people are called to. I'm fairly confident you'll feel a couple steps further on the path yes and they've helped you so it's it's a good recommendation so well okay until next time but where can people find you online Peter.
