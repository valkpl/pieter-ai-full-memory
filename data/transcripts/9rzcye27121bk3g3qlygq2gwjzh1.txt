 This is the unsuitable podcast. I'm Mary B. Safret, a communicator, creator, and coach. Passionate about filling the gap between what the church offers and what single Christians need. Each episode this season, we're going to explore what it looks like to form deep relationships as people who aren't married this week. You're going to hear from Peter Volk. Peter is a licensed professional counselor, the director of a clip and co-founder of the Nashville family of brothers, an ecumenically Christian brotherhood for men called to vocational solonus. He helps churches love gay people and sell the Christians fine-tune home. In today's episode, you'll hear Peter talk about building community as a gay Christian called to lifelong vocational sing-on-est. The necessity of commitment in relationships, the Nashville family of brothers modern, is on the nasty life, and mutually beneficial relationships between singles, married folks, and the church. Before we hear from Peter, I want to take just a minute to tell you about the awesome company unsuitable as partnering with this season.

Alright, here's my conversation with Peter. Hey, Peter. Hey, Maryby. So as we're kicking things off here, I would love for you to tell the people a little bit about yourself. What's he? Well, first I guess I'm a Christ follower. I'm also gay. I realize when I was in middle school that I found other guys attractive and so being a Christian and being gay and trying to make sense, that has been a pretty meaningful part of my story. And I'm also convinced the way God thinks about this stuff is what some people call a traditional sexual effect. I do believe that the God's best for every Christian is either a kind of a lifetime commitment to abstinent singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention or a lifetime commitment to some marriage between a man and a woman with an openness to doing the important kingdom work of a raising kid. So I think all of us are made for lifelong, lived in human family in the body of Christ. And so one of the ways I found family has been the matchville family of brothers, which is this like quasi-monestery that I helped start a matchville. That I think I'll share a little bit more about later. So I'm going to give all of that away yet. You know, what else about me? I'm a licensed professional counselor. So like a half-day week, I meet with clients in counseling who trying to make sense of faith and sexuality. And then the rest of the week, I helped run a ministry called Equip. And we're basically like a team of a missionary consultant who helped churches become places where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic like I described earlier. So you know, where the churches we work with, they're not coming to us and asking, you know, how do we fix the gay people in our churches so they fit into? That's not what we do. We work with churches who come to us and say, we love gay people. We love God's wisdom for gay people. And we're not seeing great fruit of that right now. Can you help us do this better? Can you help us? The church leaders, the parents, do this better. So the gay people in our churches that aren't, we love, we'll thrive and then they're in will bear good fruit. So that's that. I'm interested to hear a little bit more about how you have formed deep relationships as someone who's single. Yeah. So I say, I kind of low expectations about friendship for a while. I mean, in middle school, when I realized that I was gay, I was terrified of close friendship with anyone, but particularly with other dudes because I was afraid people might find out I was gay and then I would get hurt. So then being a part of this Christian fraternity in college was cool because I felt I had meaningful friendships for the first time. But even then, it wasn't until I started meeting with a therapist in college and studying some kind of like the spiritual friendships in scripture that I really let myself need friendship in deeper ways, need other people in deeper ways, like put myself in a position where I could get hurt. I mean, the stuff that I worked through in counseling was I was just afraid. I didn't know that I could have intimate friendship with someone and that not just be a slippery slope to something sinful. I was in fear of any kind of intimacy with other guys in particular because I had a lot of shame and maybe internalized homophobia that I perceived all of my desires for anything with another dude to be wrong. And it took meaning with a therapist to separate what was friendship from what was romantic, from what was sexual, and some of the listeners here made disagree with me on sexual ethics and that's fine and I'm not, you know, but what's something what I was important that I'm pointing out is that not everything is sexual, you know, it's not everything is romantic and I couldn't make that distinction before I met with this therapist. So that was really helpful. And then getting a description and someone pointing out for the first time to me, the friendships of David and Jonathan and Ruth and Naomi and Jesus from John of Polyntimity and these like deeper committed friendships and then like historical examples over the past 2000 years. I mean, I just, I don't know, I started to realize how low of your friendship I have and the friendship had a lot more it could offer if I was willing to to lean into it. So so in college I like I leaned into that and almost like with the band and I'd weed in some friendships and like we've kind of probably with some naive ae that people would love well and reciprocate well and that the no friend would ever leave me, you know, but like every person that I was willing to invest in would make some kind of David and Jonathan oath with me or something and at which then led to like heartbreak because, you know, brings us change and most of the people I was around weren't looking for, if they were looking for a best friend and they were looking for a best friend in a spouse but they weren't looking for, I mean, you know, same sex best friendship and then, you know, when I left college, most people moved away or if they stuck around, you know, we went from having 15 hours of class a week to 40 hours of work a weekend and there's just went bus time to connect with people and people started to have it to you with scarcity prioritize those precious hours and often that was prioritized around romantic relationships. So that was tough. I think in some ways, I know a lot of people who look finally back on college and the kind of community experience in college and maybe I think I for a while took for granted the practical, how much like college, for a, offered a, provided an opportunity for deep friendship, time and space and energy and the lot of them is just practical barriers, starting the same depth of friendship now, right? Like I had 15 hours of class of hours in class and maybe maybe another 15 hours of homework of really like focus homework a week. Okay, 30 hours of work a week in college, now 40 hours a week, right? I mean, that's 10 less hours, but you can put that's number of waking hours we have, that's 10 really meaningful hours. It makes a difference that you're living all on the same building with the people that you want to be friends with in college versus just the five minute drive to hang out with people after college. It makes a huge difference. I think it makes a big difference that like like for a lot of us we have the privilege of like scholarship or our parent paying for for our living expenses. But when I'm not really worried about the stresses of five minutes, but it's not true after college, right? So there's just so many things that made friendship easy in college and then when we hit the real world they're not easy. So I think that's what changed for me and then like I had come three different like intentional living situations with other guys after college and none of them involving commitments but all of them like, okay, we're some Christian guys. We're going to rent the house together. We're going to, you know, pray together some. We're going to be intentional. There's a lot of like a vague kind of aspirational stuff that, you know, one after another, the community, cell apart guys, new cities for a job, or new cities for our marriage or just moved out of the house for a marriage or there were disagreements that are leaning into working out those disagreements they kind of went elsewhere. And at one point I think my heart just got really tired of connecting deeply with people and then having to go to the next. That like that connection being broken. Yeah. And I don't want to like in any way belittle the real pain of divorce or like a Christian marriage, a true becoming one being broken and now painful. That is, but the the closest thing I could compare it to was what I heard that was the the the the the the the the the thing I could compare what I was feeling was what I heard my friend to have experienced divorce describing. But like we're not made to connect deeply with people and then be torn apart. We're not made for that. Like it makes sense that our hearts would like yell and scream in resistance for that and say this is too painful. And that's what I felt like I think it at some point after kind of those naively throwing myself into myself and to deep friendship and college and then the like string of intentional Christian community to spell apart. Like my heart basically said we're not going to let anyone else in until that love is safe. No no no more no one else gets to come in until that love is safe. And I knew what safe meant to my heart safe meant like it's not going to be broken. They're not going to leave. It's going to be permanent. And maybe not everyone needs that. But but I realized well there's some conversations with friends and family and therapists and pastor like I think what I realized is I needed something permanent. And I'll say I I mean I do actually think that's a universal need like I actually think like family is a sacrament of sort. It's an ordinary thing that helps with teachers about the mystery of God's love and is an ordinary thing through which God loves us. And I don't know when I look at God's family in the Trinity in between Christ and the Church I see a love that is perfectly faithful that is permanent. That is lifelong. So I kind of think that like if human families are supposed to be these things that that is supposed to mirror the love of God and his family to help us teach. Help teachers about God's love. I kind of think actually we're all made for some permanent human family. I think that's how that's I think it's a proper way for that sacrament to be embodied. So personal opinion. So anyway I shared earlier okay that I thought I was called to this like lifetime single for the sake of the kingdom that I think the people still need family. So what does that look like? Well I didn't know the answer to that question. So I said I think this question is of my pastor. I said hey pastor man what's the answer? And you know he's a straight dude he's married he has kids but through some different life stuff he had gone through he kind of would not retreat to a monastery out in the southwest. Frequently and has and there will be friendships with lumps out there. So he has a sensitivity towards knowing what people who are committed to lifetime single means. So I asked him how do I find family and celibacy. And I'm so thankful for his honesty and his answer because he said Peter I don't think you're going to find the kind of family you need in this church or any church in Nashville anytime soon. And I'm really sorry about that. But the most common way that celibate people have found a family throughout your history has been the massive thing. It's been the greatest source of theology in the church. It's been the greatest source of social justice in the church. It's been the greatest source of evangelism in the church. So if you feel like you're supposed to stay in Nashville and if you can't find something like that in Nashville already, maybe you should try to start something and stick around in our church and teach us how to do it. So that's what it did like four years ago. Some other guys and I who you kind of felt a need for something similar started gathering weekly for meals and reading through a book about discernment and basically with open hands praying, God are you calling us to start some kind of monastery in Nashville. And fast forward to today that's what I live in right now. That's what I'm doing this podcast from is the Nashville family of brothers. So I can share more about that. But I guess the short-answered question, how do I form deeper relationships with a single person? I think I've realized that I need the people coming out of the deepest relationships with other people I live with and the people who are committed to me and the people who I've made commitments to. At least for me, I think those are essential ingredients for my heart to let myself have those deepest friendships and let myself meet them and not live in confident hearing anxiety that I will lose them. And I think maybe that's kind of what God's made me for. So yeah. Yes, I would love to hear a little bit more like functionally like what your Nashville family of brothers, how that kind of functions. Maybe we'll have some other questions as well. But I would love to hear more about the like nuts and bolts of it. Yes, yeah. Many people are people are often curious. Okay, a monastery would have been that way. Oh, my ribs. Right. Yeah. So I would say how we're like, how we are like a typical monastery is that we all live in the same house. We do morning prayer together every morning, except for Sunday morning. And we do like a modified version of like book of common prayer, morning prayer. We do some confession and accountability stuff routinely. We do a certain number of meals together each week. We do vacations together. We do holiday together. Like we alternate Thanksgiving and Christmas is with our biological family. We eventually will make lifetime commitment to each other, to this community. And lifetime commitments to add some in singleness for the sake of Kingdomward with undivided attention. We think we're supposed to live kind of simply with our finances. And we do some stuff in common financially. We're different than in typical monastery is, well first, our monastery is not our church. It is not our place of worship. We are all connected to our local churches. And we're amongst the the five guys in the house right now, we go to three different churches. No, excuse me, four different churches. Yes, four different churches. And so we, you know, a big part of the National Family brothers is that we requires brothers just to be committed to the mission and the community of a local church outside of the National Family brothers. It's very important to us. Another thing of the way we're different than a typical monastery is like our places and employment, our job is not in the monastery. Like, I guess some of us are working from home these days because of COVID things and lingering COVID things. But like none of us are employed by our home. We all have jobs outside of the National Family brothers. And we believe that because we're called a vocational single, we should be particularly leveraging our nine to five jobs to bring about the Kingdom more swiftly. And we can give our first fruits to those kinds of efforts because we can afford to take the jobs that are maybe more optimized for Kingdom work because we aren't doing the expensive work of raising kids. And because we're kind of living in community, we are cost-or-low workers. We're sharing a lot of things. So we've got a guy who is kind of working for a kind of apologetics and path-sertraining ministry. I'm doing the work I'm doing with a quip. We've got another guy who's working for a Christian university kind of helping with kind of only academic side of that. And we've got guys doing good and other things and exploring what it looks like for them to kind of use their single notes for the Kingdom. So that's the way that we're kind of different than a typical monastery. And then like we're not cloistered. We don't live two hours away from the city. We live in the city. We're still really connected to our friend, who are married and to their kids and really want to be integrated in the life of our city. So yeah, that's the National Family and Brothers. I love that. I would like to hear more about something that you mentioned previously about intentional living situations that ended or people moved out because they didn't want to lean into like the working out of disagreements. And I think that you also were talking a lot about safety and this idea of relational safety. And I think those two things go kind of hand in hand. So I would just be interested in hearing how leaning into those like disagreements or conflicts that come up has actually maybe, well, let's not make it a leading question. How does that affect your relationships? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I mean that's been different in the National Family of Brothers because well for a couple of reasons. One because you know, we're so we're increasingly making, I've not made a lifetime commitment to the National Family of Brothers yet. No one has. You know, we kind of start out by making one year commitments and then we make three or commitments. And then if we feel confident enough, the God is calling us to make lifetime commitment. We make lifetime commitment. But still, you know, it's a guy's made three year commitment to this community. You know, that's longer than most leases, right? You know, I mean, most people don't make a, if you're kind of living with roommates post college, maybe you make it to your commitment. But even then, it's a recognition that you're not actually, if you need to leave, you can sublet your spine, you can leave and you want to, right? So like, I know that these guys are kind of stuck with me and I stuck with them for better or for worse. So when some things come up that, you know, I'm rather than someone else the wrong way, they're rubbing me the wrong way. You know, maybe if I knew all my leases up in six months or I can leave in three months and just get too difficult. Maybe I'd just ignore it, you know. But if I'm stuck with these guys for three or even more years, I don't know if I can ignore this for three years. I think we just need to talk about it. So it's, it can sometimes be inconvenient because sometimes I would rather just ignore stuff. But it's beautiful because it forces us to have these tough conversations. And what it ultimately, what I consistently see is the fruit of that. If we, if we do conflict well and it healthy ways and if I'm willing to own what I do wrong and I'm willing to confess, is I know people more deeply on the other side of conical. As opposed to feeling more distant from people, I feel more connected to people on the other side of healthy conflict and kind of work and through stealth. Sometimes I'm really irritated by the fact that living in this community forces me to be able to do my certification more or more earnestly. But certainly when I zoom out and over the long haul, I think I'll be really grateful. You know, I did a mission trip between college and grad school and I was on a team of women and, you know, we were together for 11 months, not all of us, the team kind of switched out. But some of us were together for 11 months and we did not always get along. But there was like this built-in feedback mechanism where we kind of had to deal with it because we were like seven women sharing a room, you know, and you just, you just like can't, you don't have the luxury of letting things faster because things get like extremely miserable, extremely quickly. And so, but at the same time, like what you're saying is there's like a really cool fruit that comes out of it that deepens the relationship that like makes has the potential for people to like trust one another more because I know like, oh, this person has seen me not at my best or knows this thing about me that I would prefer to hide from other people and they still like are still here and they still want to be here. They're still like choosing to make an effort to be around me. Yeah, totally. Totally. Yeah, it's definitely a privilege and it's definitely difficult at times. And yeah, but and even practice doesn't make perfect. Or we need a lot of help. I mean, we've talked about basically going to like a marriage therapist, but like for our whole, you know, community. Yeah. And kind of some couples therapy, but for five of this, the talk through stuff. And we're, you know, going to start reading through a book scene about like just kind of norming on expectations around healthy interpersonal conflict. So yeah, so, you know, if anyone wants the book changes that he owe, I forget the name of the author, but that's, you know, if anyone out there, whether it's with a falter or with a group of friends or with a intentional Christian community kind of thing or trying to be like, yeah, what are there some resources that I can learn now to do, God's like better. Yeah, I think that's a good book. I'd be curious to hear about how this has informed your relationship with your local church if you're still part of the church that you like, sought counsel from before like starting this, how this has affected that relationship. Yeah. So I'm still part of that same church church of the Redeemer and Anglican church here in Nashville. And that pastor who gave the, the honest, the honest feedback and the good advice was, uh, Father Thomas McKenzie. Yeah. And I hope you're going to let church for the rest of my life. You know, we'll see what God's plans are. But yeah, I mean, so Father Thomas has been actually really instrumental in the Nashville family of brothers forming. He kind of consistently would have met with me and another leader to kind of hear how we're doing, to pray for us, to give us some advice, to kind of talk to some of the practical aspects of this. He, you know, increasingly has been teaching in our church about celibacy and about spiritual fatherhood and, and kind of, I've noticed the transformation in the ways that he's talking about discernment and vocational singleness and Christian marriage from the pulpit. And then, you know, when we realize, okay, we think we're going to start doing this in a more formalized way and we think we need to make kind of a one-year commitment to this delio. He said, okay, let's use the church. Let's do it in the sanctuary. He led the ceremony in his collar. We got to use the fellowship all afterwards to celebrate together. So it's they've been a huge support. And the couple that were kind of closest to in the church that are kind of the the other kind of co-founder and I, the parents of actually each of our godsson are so very closely connected to us and our very supportive of this and, and they're excited about their, you know, sons and daughters, you're growing up around us and growing up, you know, in our houses and seeing a bunch of fellow-to-do doing, following the Lord in a different way, you know, and then, and those young Christians getting to see what marriage looks like and what vocational singleness looks like and and being open to either from the Lord. So that's been super cool. And definitely ways that like our churches, that the leaders at our church are supportive of the National Family Brothers and are creating more and more spaces where we can share about what we're doing and where we can find community. So I don't think this final solution is for every single person committed to lifetime, single, salivate, single-sex, monastery, like I think in some ways it's more of a temporary solution, right? I mean, in an ideal world, we would all live in the things communities as our churches, we would be committed to those churches for the rest of our life and we would live in like multi-family, multi-generational like homes and like clusters of homes in that neighborhood, right? And if that were the case, I go, there would be no need for this monastery, right? I don't know if like my church or the church is a master organ, like get to that anytime soon. And so this is not just a life raft for the next couple of years, this may need to be a more a very sturdy life raft, right? And this may need to be a more permanent life raft, more like an aircraft carrier of course. So yeah. I'm really passionate about the idea of like expanding our imagination for what's possible for, especially for our lives as people who are single, but then, you know, just in general for what it means to follow God and what it means to live a life of faith, you know, I think that there's such a robust picture of that inscripture and I think there's such a that, you know, the kinds of relationships that you're talking about really help to broaden that picture and to expand the conversation and even as you're talking about how like it's informed the kinds of things that are being talked about from the pulpit and the kinds of relationships that you're building with the people in your church, you know, it's I think it's a really compelling picture of of what the church could be and what a direction that it could go if we kind of were able to allow ourselves to learn from each other in the way that you've like been able to find. I would actually like to hear a little bit more here you talk more about discerning vocational singleness. So I think it would be rude every Christian, the kind of pause, you know, if they're not married yet or haven't made a lifetime commitment to sell it to you, to pause and really open handedly discern whether God's preference for them is Christian marriage or vocational singleness and I think some good ingredients for that discernment is meeting with a spiritual director or someone who can guide you through that discernment process, good cheat code for that is time to close this Catholic retreat center to where you live and then there probably is a spiritual director there who maybe a little bored and asks them to lead you through this process. You'll probably get, they'll probably say yes and then we will do a referee about the sweetest person you'll spend time with every week and it'll be great. So get a spiritual director or someone that leads you through this discernment process, you know, yeah, so number one spiritual director. Number two, like I think part of discernment is to make sure we have a healthy theology of both vocational and marriage so kind of study up. Number three is we got to remove any emotional barriers we have to either and for me that was like working through some of my stuff and counseling related to singleness and related to marriage, you know, and maybe it doesn't mean that we clear out all of our resistances or all of our preferences, maybe it just means I haven't awareness of what my biases are emotionally to these vocations. You know for me, you know, one thing you can do with that spiritual director is to kind of look at our path and see if it suggests kind of any kind of providence in our circumstances for like which which vocation god might have for us. I think I'll also ask you the question of like, hey, god, like, are you calling me to a nine to five job that kind of necessitate vocational singleness in order to do it well? Or god, might you be, do I have a feeling that like the primary thing to work your calling you to do is raise kids? Or god, do I feel like neither of those, you know, that can be an informative question for whether or not god is maybe calling someone to vocational singleness or Christian marriage. And then yeah, lots of prayer, lots of time in conversation in community in the word. So yeah, I think everyone should discern, I think there's some good ingredients for discernment, you know, gosh, if every Christian open and really discerned between these two things, maybe it would still lead to like only five or 10 percent of Christian embracing lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom. And so 90 percent of people do in Christian marriage. But you know what, it would lead to a lot more people I think in a positive way embracing singleness as a vocation, as opposed to singing, as in volunteering. And I think we're going to lead to those, those majority of people who end up doing Christian marriage, instead of seeing it as the default path, seeing it as a gift, seeing it as a responsibility, seeing as a mission from God. So I think discernment would lead to healthier marriage as and healthy healthier singing will nurture. So I think it's worth saying and kind of honoring that also, I mean, kind of because my story is on a gay cell, the Christian, I'm often some of the content of having these conversations as we're saying about other gay cell, the Christian. But the more, the more numerous kind of is single Christian women in church. And I think it needs to be said that like, they're obviously some Christian women who are called to lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom. Right? I think there's also probably many women who God's maybe first hope for them was Christian but because there aren't enough faithful men in the church, there is a practical barrier to them stepping in to maybe what God's first hope for them was. And I think as men in the church, we need to own that. We need to recognize that. And then we need to reckon with the reality of, okay, so then if a kind of boatload full of faithful men doesn't show up tomorrow on the shores of our church, what does that mean for these women? And I think sometimes our churches in subtle ways make the gess that these women aren't finding spouses because something on with them. Yes. Instead of recognizing, no, they're not finding spouses because men are unfaithful. And but that, but that might not fix the problem. What does it look like to, to some more in this with women? To be angry with them. And then for our church, it's actually do be, do do a better job of supporting single people in our churches, whether they're single because they're called to a lifetime location of single nests for the sake of the kingdom, whether they find themselves in long term single nests, despite their preference or despite God's preference, how can we have better structures in our churches and the poor anyone who's doing single nests aren't churches? So yeah, I think those things need to be said. Oh, absolutely. For sure. And I'm glad that you said them. I think our churches have got to do a better job of celebrating single men. And I think a really great way to do that is, is if people are interested in making some kind of store-term or long-term commitments to single nests for the Lord, doing that in our church, like like the Pansard Archers, was willing to let us use archers to do this ceremony. And then, and doing a big, right? I mean, we're kind of under dreaming a little bit about when I make lifetime commitment to the National Family of Brothers, what's that going to look like? You know, big organ, brass quintet, black tie then. Do I right? I joke that I'm going to fit as much money on my lifetime commitments ceremony as people spend on the wedding. And then I realize that I would get, I would have said, you know, I'm not just sorry. I don't have enough money to do a for that. So I probably won't do that. But no, do a big, right? I mean, and it's, it's you'll silly, maybe if sometimes it's a materialistic, but the other things that like, signal to what, the this is valuable, the this matter. It's a marker. Yeah, it is. And it's meaningful. These milestones are meaningful. And then if there's a commitment we do to this, when we have an anniversary to celebrate, you know, so the set, so celebrate that. I think we've got to see it model in our churches, right? I think our churches need to be intentional about seeking out leaders, leaders who are upfront, who are called to singleness for the sake of the kingdom for a lifetime or they're in long-term singleness. I'm not saying that of the detriment, but celebrating that speaking to that. Also, nothing that's something our church is going to be used and task singles with doing everything in the churches because they're singles. Yep. Yep. So the balance there, but I think modeling it is really important. And then I think our churches have got to be kind of facilitators, be fostering, you know, how to sell the people find families in the body of pride. Maybe it's maybe it's being like my pastor and helping people start monastery. Maybe it's kind of a more informal kind of intentional Christian community that the church serves as kind of a gathering place, kind of an incubator for. Maybe it's kind of, you know, helping pair single people with unrelated new newer families. It would be interested in living kind of a smaller, intentional community arrangement. Whatever it is, I think our churches need to be kind of the brokers, the facilitators of single people finding family on the body of pride. So there's lots of the church needs to be. Okay, lots of the church needs to be. But there's probably a lot of people who listen to that list and say, my church is never going to do that. What can I do? And what you can guess that on our monastery, or it's not necessarily a start, you know? No, but I think really what they're honestly like, how can I find comfort in this? And there's a book by a guy named Max Thurian about Mary Jinsel, that I really like. And he addresses this question, kind of, what about people who find themselves in long-term single-nest? Don't feel like this was their call, but it seems a level inevitable, too dim that they will be single for a lifetime. What do they do then? And he talked about the author invited pastors to very lovingly and carefully guide these single people first through maybe a morning process of feeling like that, that's not going to happen, you know? And not and to honor that pain by bringing in the light by naming it, by crying about it, you know? By getting angry about it. And then what does it look like for that pastor to very carefully, very lovingly, invite that single person to say, you know, maybe this was a year-first preference, maybe it wasn't even God's first preference that you do lifetime single-nest? Getting as a benefit to for you, to mentally embracing life times in a moment. What would it look like to ask God for that year? And to step into that in a more chosen way, to embrace that fully, even if some of your heart is always going to be a little bit reluctant to it. Because I think there's a sense of even with some reluctance, stepping into that, embracing that, claiming that, that provides some peace, provides some direction, provides some finality, provides some, I'm not waiting anymore, I'm not going to move forward with this plan, even though it was a my first plan. That can be really helpful for people. Yeah. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Frate Man, pretty much in the choir here. I love it. I love it all. In our last few moments, would you, I would love to hear how we can support you? Sure. Okay. Let's see. If you're a listener and you're straight and not married, you can discern whether God's cognitive vocational single-nest or marriage. Maybe even the start, start something like the National Family Brothers. If you plan on raising children, you know, a way you can kind of indirectly help people like me is teacher children about God's love and wisdom for all people and prepare all of them to discern between vocational single-nest and Christian marriage, regardless of sexual orientation. If you listen to this and you're like interested in a whole master family of brothers, idea either because you would like to join, or you want to start something similar, like please reach out to me. It's Peter L. Vol P. I. E. T. E. R. L. V. Z. Victor A. L. K. On all platforms, love to talk about that. Would love to like, if your intention starting something like this and another thing, would the coach you through that? Like, I, I, I want them to be like the National Family Brothers and the National Family of Sisters and in the lots of cities and cross America. So please do that. If you were interested in like this stuff, I mentioned earlier about a quit this ministry around LGBT topics, you can also kind of reach out to me on any of those platforms at Peter L. Vol and would love to connect you with some free resources and and and and talk to you about the work of a quit or your intention and supporting the work of a quit financially. You can find all that info there. And then yeah, I mean, if you get on any of those platforms, you'll probably find my link tree and you can find some articles related to all of these conversations we've been having on that yeah, those are different ways people can like continue connecting and continue this conversation. Love it and all of those links and whatnot will be in the episode description. So it's nice and easy for people to find you. If you have Peter last but certainly not least, will you tell me one thing that's hard right now and one thing that's great. The full building, monastery thing is involved with a lot of trial and error and the that error is painful and and we're doing this like while each of us who are trying to build this thing are also starving for a life giving experience of family and the body of Christ. So you know, kind of like building a life-rath while you're thinking kind of thing. Yeah, yeah. So you know that I guess it's a hard thing, you know, we're we're finding our way but we really need God grace and you know your prayers may be and prayers of your listeners. But I think I'm like really thankful for a thing that the great is like we've got five guys in the house right now. We've got two or three more guys moving in in the next kind of three to six months. We're we're getting ready to celebrate some new commitment to some guys. We've been going on vacation together. You know, like I think we're we're making the kind of memory that hopefully we'll look back fondly on like five years from now or fifty years from now. Like just recently we've been a more old day weekend at one of the brothers biological family's like house in Minnesota and we spent our days like working from the Lake House during the week and then on the weekend we did like some boating and we enjoyed the sunset and we ended our night like putting by the fire and the living room and chatting or listening to music or reading or playing card games and putting together a puzzle. I'm really that great. Like these times with with these men who I call family. So yeah. I love it. I'll hear it. This has been so lovely and I'm so thankful for your time and for your wisdom. Well, thank you for the opportunity. I love chatting about this stuff too. So thank you for the work you're doing. Have any conversations with my podcast?

If you're a single Christian, you'd probably found yourself in some derby situations. You know, like when someone you barely know starts talking about your biological clock, it's hard to know how to respond and can seem like nobody's talking about where these situations really are. That's why I created this single Christian derby-to-test. It's like a fun aptitude test for navigating the derby things that happen to singles at church. What if I told you that you have a social superpower that can keep you from losing you're ever living mind in these situations? Find out yours at mariebysafri.com backslash quiz.
