 Hello everybody and on today's episode we have the awesome Peter Valk, a gay celibate Christian who's full-time job for seven years now is teaching and training Christians to better serve and support gay celibate Christians and he has a master's in clinical mental health counseling if you're wondering. Today we're actually going to be talking about some really cool variety of different topics. We're going to be talking about whether or not homosexuality is a sin and if so if it is a worse sin than other sins we're going to be talking about conversion therapy and also how to identify if you struggle with same-sex attraction as a Christian like how would you identify yourself. So just a little bit about myself my name is Samuel Perez and I am a former gay stripper. Yes that's right you heard that correctly. I left behind the homosexual lifestyle to walk with Christ and this podcast is all about how I do it and why I do it and to help others like me and educate those that maybe are not like me. I want to talk but I really want to talk about what a real life which Jesus looks like in 2021 and guys nothing is off limits. I want to be as transparent as I possibly can be.

SamuelAberhamPherud.com. Alright so how are you Peter doing well Abraham and really glad to be here. He called me by my middle name yeah I love him. Oh Samuel sorry what am I thinking? That's okay that's okay I like I love my middle name especially coming into Christ like it's it means father and it's just like father and many nations or something like that and just think it's as so much more meaning like before I would never like talk about my middle name and then now it's like a part of like who I am like I feel like it's a part of my identity now so thank you for mentioning it. It's a good one. Yeah that those opening intros are always so hard to do but I'm so excited to really get into all of these things that we're going to be talking about. I think that this this podcast is going to be so informative to so many people who follow and subscribe to this YouTube I have like so many questions prepared for you but before we get into those really deep diving questions I want to talk to you a little bit about your testimony can you tell me a little bit about who you are then you know where you were raised and stuff like that. Yeah so I grew up in kind of culturally conservative rural East Tennessee in the 90s. I'm a 90s baby and you know probably like some other people in the same time in my community growing up people barely talked about gay people or homosexuality. If they did it was a quick mention that like God hates gay people or God is against homosexuality and whenever I heard anyone like talking about gay people they they they they painted a very particular picture every time that all gay people are going to group sex parties they're all addicted to drugs they all are addicted to alcohol they all have AIDS and they all hate Jesus like that's every time someone used the word gay in my community growing up it was clear that's what they meant by it. So you know when I was a summer after my fourth grade I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior and in many ways kind of just confirming the faith that my parents claimed for me at my infant baptism and then a middle school I started to realize that I was attracted to other dudes that I was gay which is confusing because I knew that I wasn't like these gay people as as kind of I heard it described popularly in culture but yet I also could tell that my attractions to women and my attractions to men were different than then my peers so so I assumed that it was because I had done something wrong you know maybe if I if I quit playing video games for six months then Jesus will make me straight but I tried to make these deals with God I prayed and anytime that time went by and God didn't seem to heal and remove my same sex attractions well then I try to make another deal okay what if I make straight AIDS what if I do everything my parents say you know and over the next like honestly decade I probably prayed nightly that God would change my my sexual orientation they'd make me straight and all the typical ways I met with three different therapists who promised they could increase my heterosexuality I went to multiple kind of psychotherapeutic weekend men's weekend weekend retreats that the promise to help change my sexual orientation I even interned with an ex- gay ministry for for nine months with a promise that there would be some kind of kind of charismatic conversion there and at the end of that 10 years nothing changed about kind of the intensity of my attractions for for dudes you know but my capacity to resist temptation my capacity to say no to temptation definitely changed definitely increased so I guess that's a change of sorts but gosh I mean in the middle of all of that praying and going to weekend retreats and meeting with therapists I was just trying to figure out what does it mean to be gay and a Christian and a teenager which is confusing enough in the 90s so I mean I was terrified people would find out my story and treat me poorly I remember during high school you know the whole gay marriage debate was big in politics when I was in high school which which dates me but we were debating we were doing a mock debate about gay marriage in my history class and fulfilling stereotypes I was like the most ardently anti gay marriage you know maybe to throw people off from the fact that I was in the closet and so I was arguing vehemently against gay marriage and then I remember to my terror the girl that was sitting in the chair in front of me flipped around on her chair and she looked to me and with like disgust like venom in her face and her eyes she said to me I bet you're secretly gay and you're just against gay marriage because you want anyone to know who you really are and she like tends me 100% so I was terrified I mean there are other times too when I was particularly scared and ashamed I mean I was in the high school cross country team and there only one other guy on our school who was out who was openly gay at the time and he was also on the cross country team and you know we would always line up on the starting line of races and kind of do partner paired stretching so I remember this was like the week after he had come out publicly and he went from guy to guy on our cross country team trying to find someone to help him stretch and one after another every one of the guys refused and they said gross I don't want to touch you and I don't want you touching me and then yeah he got to me and I sheepishly refused as well like I I dished out the same pain that I spent many nights crying about so that was pretty crappy but yeah eventually like I really I wanted people to know this was my story I wanted people to know this part of my life I wanted to hide anymore so you know first I like told my parents sophomore year of high school they didn't know how to help me any better than knew how to help myself but you know at least that wasn't alone anymore later in high school I was on one of these like Christian youth retreats and there was this kind of stereotypical Saturday night message where the past are challenged just to go share with a leader or deepest arc is secret and kind of free ourselves of that and so I went and share with my youth pastor my deepest arc is the year which is hey I'm attracted to dudes I'm same sex attracted I'm gay and and he kind of shared a couple of like Christian cliches and then sent me away um gosh another like painful experience in college I was actually a part of this like campus ministry this Christian ministry on it's at school and I like for four years led Bible studies I helped us to recruitment efforts I like represented our ministry to the university and I was given every reason to believe that if I wanted to go on staff with that ministry after I graduated I could and then during my senior year of college without warning I was told that I couldn't apply to go on staff with that ministry or that ministry at any other campus the only explanation they gave was we don't know what to do with your same sex attractions and you know to be clear like I mean for all this time I continue to be convinced of a traditional sexual ethic I continue to be a event that convinced that the gay sex and romance are sins in any context so it was not like I had some boyfriend that I was running around on campus with and that's why they said yeah I couldn't know they knew I was gay they knew I was committed to sell we'll see they knew that I was doing my best to be faithful to that commitment so I wasn't anything to do with myself I was just a fact is gay they didn't want gay around them yeah which sucks yeah and so it's safe to say that you have and had the most amazing experiences within the Christian community and I think you know it's it's it's kind of relieving to hear that because I for example have also not had the best experiences when it comes to Christianity like I remember being rejected so many times at the church and luckily for me my relationship when I when it first began when I when I would say I was really really committed to the Lord or born again which was around four or five years ago can't really remember but I remember I had I didn't chase after the approval of people my only intention was to chase after god that's what I wanted like I wanted to leave behind my life I wanted to leave behind the goals that it's up for myself the dreams the jobs and all these things so when I did hit those blocks of like the Christian that just wanted to shun me or just wanted to push me away they didn't want to deal with the Iki they didn't want to deal with the fact that oh my gosh same sex attraction like to me it was tough but at the same time I realized wait why am I doing this am I doing this for the approval of the church my doing this for the approval even other people which kind of sucks because they're you know supposed to be the body of Christ they're supposed to be there for you but at the same time I was like no I'm I'm doing this for god a really good question that I wrote down as you were sharing do you think coming to Christ at such a young age do you think that you were genuinely chasing god or that you were chasing after wanting to be part of like being straight basically like since you had been told since you were like a very young boy like this is the standard and you wanted to be accepted by not just god but also people do you genuinely feel looking back now that you made that decision for god like I'm gonna chase after god or you made the decision just like I kind of want to feel approval from other people like what would you say yeah I mean so I think kind of the historic teaching of the church is that salvation is a process that begins with accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior in one way or another and then continue throughout our life of becoming more like Jesus and growing closer to God and then ultimately after we die got to god finishes the work of making us a new creation and then we were perfectly reunited with god so you know I don't know if any of us when we when we get saved or are all the way there or really fully appreciate what we've committed to or what it needs to be a Christ follower but yeah I mean I think my my confession of faith and in fourth grade was was super genuine as much as a fourth we're going to greater can I'll say this I've never felt a need since then to make any kind of new profession of faith I've never doubted whether or not like that was the moment but yeah I mean some ways I hadn't gone through puberty yet and so I wasn't aware of the fact that anything would be different about me than anyone else but but I also I'd say I probably wasn't also aware of how much I was a sinner or how broken the world is and how much the world needed Jesus to come and to return so it's probably not until I went through puberty I started realizing that everything about this world is broken including my sexuality that gosh I I do the things that I don't want to do I say the things that I don't want to say I really need Jesus too and this world around me really needs Jesus yeah definitely you know I'm actually hearing your story and I love that you you shared that testimony especially with those who are listening because it kind of gives people a backdrop to understanding okay this is why Peter is so empathetic with those who are struggling with same sexual traction because it's kind of like um I read in a book recently like there is no test well there's no testimony without a test and I think that's really interesting because like the things that we go through actually help us like the Lord is the Lord didn't just allow Peter to go through all these things that were really hurtful to not for not to produce fruit he allowed for you to go through that so that you can have a sense of understanding empathy for individuals who have been just so rejected so close out of the church and you are coming in here and doing things that may be evangelicals or conservative Christians you know people who are dare I say by both um first would be like oh my god rainbow colors no you know like saying you're a gate Christian absolutely not you know but a lot of what you're doing is actually coming from a root of love and understanding oh you know god loves me and accepts me and I'm going to allow the Holy Spirit to be the Holy Spirit which is some of what you mentioned actually on your own YouTube channel but um I wanted to ask you some questions just get really into it right away um since you already shared the testimony the things that you went through um first off what is something that you've right now deal with um as a Christian in your life like struggling with yeah I'd say the biggest challenges right now gosh a long-term challenge has been I mean I'm a doubter like it's it's doubting whether God exists comes easily to me and that's been true for gosh the past decade so learning how to be faithful in the midst of doubt um definitely um and then I mean as we'll sure we'll talk about more right I'm gay and Christian and I'm committed to a lifetime of abstinent singleness for the sake of kingdom work and so I'm not going to find family in the typical way of kind of the wife and kids in a single family home and so that's really interesting let let's explore that why you for example um label yourself as a gay Christian instead of labeling yourself as an ex gay Christian or like why is it that you've chosen not specific title for yourself yeah yeah well briefly I'd say I mean I described earlier kind of my 10 years in the ex gay movement uh pray the gay way therapy ex gay retreats charismatic ex gay ministry that I interned for nightly prayer that God would change my sexual orientation and for me that 10 years was like really painful um it it it was really kind of spiritually destructive for me it maybe it's not for everyone um but you know the science out there says that 96% of people who participate in sexual orientation change efforts don't experience any meaningful change in their sexual orientation but what sexual orientation change efforts are good at is doubling people's risk of suicidality um so so for me kind of the phrase same sex attraction the word ex gay the phrase struggling with homosexuality are all kind of associated with that really painful phase of my life and around the time that I was starting to come to terms with that is also when some Christian or Christians around me who were same sex attracted and committed to a traditional sexual ethic we're starting to kind of call themselves gay celibate Christians or gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic in a sense of kind of like trying to reclaim that term from the gay community um which also makes sense to me because like I do a lot of of teaching with with parents and pastors who are working with teens and kind of elementary school age kids and when I ask a middle school or a elementary school age kid he says what does it mean to be gay they don't assume anything about someone's theological convictions anything about someone's sexual conduct they just think that means a boy who likes boys a girl who likes girls so I mean that's what I'm that's how I'm using that word when I use that word gay or yeah boys girl who likes girls yeah and that's really interesting because I think um so for example uh people who might be listening people know I consider myself or I title myself as ex gay I don't even really like to identify myself in that way I hate labels I've always hated labels even when I was in the gay lifestyle like I just hated that gay was part of my whole identity like I was like I have so much more to offer like you know like I'm not just my sexuality um and even now too but it's really a kind of a lot of people associate gay Christian with oh I'm I'm living openly a homosexual lifestyle I'm giving into those uh desires those gay desires and um a lot of people associate ex gay Christian with someone who has chosen to leave that behind or even associate them with um which is not the way that I would associate it but associate them with um some people who don't no longer experience same sex attraction so um we had a conversation about this privately which is interesting because it's kind of like it's like the the the lesser of two evils or something I don't know if I'm saying that correctly but it's kind of like one is like first off when you say gay Christian you actually just mean I am a Christian who experiences same sex attraction and when I say ex gay I am saying the same thing the only thing that I think there's a difference is that for example for me I'm very big on my words and I also know that you've had like traumatic experiences with ex gay and ministries and you know all those kind of things um so I could see your perspective on that um for me personally and why I choose to identify as an ex gay for those who are wondering listening and why we're different is because for me I'm like I don't want to at any point speak that over myself like I think like words have such power I even like I hate sometimes even saying oh yeah I have same sex attraction because I think you know just that there's so much power and that can be I guess very charismatic of me to just speak things and so even when I say that like I'm like oh yeah you know I'm next gay or I'm this and this and that I'm just like oh these are just things that I just rather just would not be speaking over myself so if I were to call myself a gay Christian it's almost like that would have a hold on me I would like be keeping that around my identity so for those of you who are listening that's like Peter feels differently he's like I want to be more empathetic which is what you were saying like I want people to um understand like and be open to the fact that like oh we can reclaim this term it doesn't necessarily have to mean that I'm giving into my sexual desires just like you said like it just means oh you know this I experience these attractions like a child would think oh your gay yeah you experience these attractions but you're not giving into that and then there's me on the other side of this spectrum where I'm like I rather label myself in this way if I have to label myself because I hate labels but anyways I was a rundown in explanation for everybody but also I think to ask you as well is you said briefly I'll never have a family or I don't I'm never gonna live that like stereotypical family lifestyle do you believe that for you personally like um do you believe that something that God can do and offer to you like do you believe that um if you wanted to change your sexual orientation would would he be able to or do you think like what do you think about that? I mean sexual orientation changed I think God can do like whatever he wants you know he's got the power to do whatever he wants you know the consistent stories and anecdotes and data shows that it's that's super infrequent that that that that is God's will but he does it sometimes I believe that um I mean for me so while I'm not bisexual I'm not generally attracted to women I did data couple of women in college and I was really transparent with them about my sexuality and in the process of dating them I grew a specific desire for each of them so when I graduated college I knew that if Christian marriage was what God wanted for me and when I say Christian marriage I'm saying an opposite sex marriage with an openness to the important kingdom work of raising children that's what I'm talking about um I knew Christian marriage was an option for me but I also had read about the singleness of Jesus and Paul in Scripture and what they had to say about celibacy for the sake of the kingdom and I can't explain it any other way than you know I'm getting slightly charismatic here that the Holy Spirit urged me that I wasn't supposed to just go take what I wanted between Christian marriage and and singleness for the Lord that I was supposed to ask God whether he had a preference for which gift he was going to give and that it would be better for me to receive from him whichever gift he wanted to give rather than demanding from him the gift that I wanted to get and so I discerned I prayed over three years asking God God what do you want from me Christian marriage with a woman or do you want me to step into what I see in Scripture Jesus and Paul talking about which they lifetime commitment to abstinent singleness for the sake of the kingdom work with undivided attention and I felt clarity from the Lord that I was called to shut the door on Christian marriage with a woman um not because I wasn't possible for me it was possible for me but because that wasn't what God was calling me to and instead embrace a life of singleness for the sake of the kingdom yeah that's really beautifully said and I I feel the same way I still like for me I've gotten a lot of prophetic wordings and people have spoken over me that I will ultimately get married and to me I would love I would love love love to have a family I've always wanted children and so if that happens great news you know but if it doesn't happen I think like being single for God is so exciting like I think like it is I don't know to me it's like it's such a blessing to be completely fulfilled by him and be so totally dependent on him where all of your burdens everything is shared with him instead of maybe in a family dynamic which is there's nothing wrong with that like I think it's just so beautiful but yeah I think maybe oh well I was going to say I mean honestly a new one for me is I actually don't think I don't expect any more intimacy with God than my married friends are getting and I actually don't think that I need any less human intimacy than my married friends are getting and I actually don't think that a commitment to singleness for the sake of the kingdom is a giving up of lived in lifelong human family I think it's a giving up of dating romance sex and and bylaw to a children but I actually do think I still need human intimacy just like anyone else and I don't think God's going to magically meet that in him alone and I think I need some kind of lived in lifelong permanent human family and I'm actually kind of the way that I felt like God's been leading me to find that is to basically start like a monastery in Nashville which means I'm crazy but that's kind of my family mm-hmm yeah I mean that it's like discipleship really you know like finding other people like you teaching them and stuff like that so yeah I can see that that was very and I agree with you as well where it's like there's so many different factors and like accountability and people and meeting emotional needs and stuff so it's not just as simple it's like oh you know God becomes everything because he is everything but he also has tools for us you know he's taught us several things we can do for each other in order to meet those needs when he wants them to be met in that specific way all right so yeah I think that was interesting all right moving to the next question um do you believe biblically that homosexuality is a worse thing than other sins in the eyes of God yeah so well first I say the word homosexuality is tricky because are we talking about people who participate in gay sex and gay romance regardless of sexual orientation yes you're referring to people who experience same sex attraction yeah definitely the ones who are giving into the homosexual making it a practice for yourself yeah I mean and even straight people right having gay sex I mean it in actually really common in the Greco Roman world for people regardless of their sexual orientation for every man of power to be having sex with a younger boy yeah any type of sex yeah yeah regardless of whether the person is gay or straight okay so I'm so I do think I mean as I said before I do think that the gay romance and gay sex are sins in any context it's not there's no context for that that God blesses in scripture and says this is good for you my children I don't think it's worse than any sin worse than any other sin in this way I don't think I think any sin no matter how small is enough to mean we can't get to have an honor of want to make that clear and number two I don't think there's any sin that after we've made Jesus are Lord and Savior any sin that can keep us from him unless we renounce denounce reject Jesus ourselves now the question of like does having gay sex does that make God more sad and does that hurt us more than if I lie to my mom about whether or not I made my bed right I think it's pretty clear that like God is more sad when I if I engage in in sexual intimacy outside of the context the God said was best for me God's more sad about that than if I like tell a little why lie and and I think that indulging in that sexual intimacy connecting with someone only to be than be torn apart from them and that not be in a context of of of a lifelong marriage for the sake of the important kingdom work of raising kids and and and embodying the gospel by having that differentness of male and female in that marriage enjoying that outside of that I think that's I don't think it's good for me and I think that hurts me much more than telling a little white lie does so I think maybe that answers your question yes for sure man um like and by the way guys if you're listening to something that Peter is saying I just want to like put a disclaimer out there because sometimes I have people on my podcast with different opinions so not everything that Peter says I'm an agreement with that's why I have him on the podcast so you guys can listen to him and you can come up with your own opinions my opinions will be on the podcast where I am alone and talking about what I believe so but this is all about Peter and me asking questions since he has these experiences so okay another question just we're gonna go through these because we have so many and it's awesome to hear you do you think labeling homosexuality as a sin is wrong I think the other question you probably answer that but like if someone were to come up to you and be like oh do you believe that homosexuality is a sin like what would you response me I think I think leading with that certainly with the stranger may not be the best strategy and and if we look in the gospel strategy actually really matters to Jesus when Jesus is talking to religious leaders with power people of privilege he tends to cut to the chase of of convicting them pretty quickly but when Jesus is talking to hurting people people on the margins people with less advantages in our society people who maybe have been mistreated by those in power Jesus first leads with asking them questions he first leads with meeting their immediate temporal needs he first leads with soothing their pain and then when he demonstrates love to them then he kind of invites them after that do you want more of that love do you want to find out what that loves really about that's how Jesus does ministry so you know there may come a time when it is easy to be gay in America and it's easier to be gay in America than it is to be straight in America but that time is not here yet it's still very difficult to be a gay person in America certainly was hard for me to grow up in the 90s and gay and certainly was hard for for generations old with me so I think it's still true that if you're trying to minister to reach out to love care for someone who is gay Christian or not I think follow Jesus's strategy the second strategy strategy that I describe there of leading with compassion of leading with questions leading with getting to know someone leading with meeting their immediate needs leading with soothing their pain and then after you demonstrated love to them then inviting them hey do you want to get to know this Jesus guide you want to know where this love's really coming from yeah that's so good because honestly I think the approach that we use for many many years is just not working you know so I think when I study the gospel as well you're completely 100% right like that is what Jesus did is that he was strategic and analyzing okay what is this person need to hear in this moment and I think being led by the Holy Spirit is so crucial that there is no right answer you know if someone were to come up to me and ask me the same question like do you believe that homosexuality is a sin I would just be like are you asking me this because you genuinely want to know are you asking me this because you want to harden your heart towards my answer or towards me you know and we have to be crucial you know not to throw our pearls to swine you know not to feed that that I guess the haters you would say contemporary terms like not to feed into that negative vibe not to feed into the people who are not really open to listening either way you know be strategic and listen from the Holy Spirit so yeah I love that do you believe that a man can be in a relationship with God and still practice a homosexual relationship because I get that question like a lot like people are like well I'm gay and I hear from God and I'm living I feel like the best way that I possibly can live with the Lord and I'm actively in a homosexual relationship and whether I identify a straight or gay or whatever like I feel like I can hear from God and I'm we're on okay terms what do you think about right? Yeah so I don't think it's a light switch kind of thing I don't think it's like God's like oh you're in a gay relationship by and then oh you're out of that gay relationship okay hey what's up I don't think that's how God works nor do I think like oh there's this friendship and it's between two dudes but it's not romantic and non-sexual oh this is great this is life-giving oh and a little gay sex now it's all bad I don't think that's how it works either so I do think that friendship is good non-romantic non-sexual friendship is good and so there's a lot of of same-sex couples out there that part of their sexual and romantic relationship is also a friendship and so yeah not surprise when they when there is some good in their relationship when they're experiencing some kind of goodness about their relationship not surprised because some of their relationship is just healthy friendship so that makes sense to me but listen if we think of God exists if we think that God knows better than us what is best for us and if we think the way we know who that God is and how he thinks about this world and what's wise is the Bible it's hard to draw any conclusion other than that that that gay sex and gay romance isn't God's best for us that that I will experience more goodness more blessing if I lean into the paths of blessing and goodness that God has created for his for Christians which is opposite sex marriage between two Christians for the for the sake of with an openness to the important kingdom work of raising kids or a lifetime commitment to abstinent singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention that's God's best for us so it's not if I'm talking to a gay person who's in a same sex partnership I'm not saying every single aspect of your relationship with this person is evil what I'm saying is God has something even better for you and my hunch is if what this relationship you're in they came something non-rementic and non-sexual but still intimate friendship like we see between David and Jonathan yeah David and Jonathan and Paul and Timothy and Jesus and John and instead of having you know romantic and sexual relationships with people of the same sex you leaned into those two best paths God gave us as believers for for honoring him with our bodies and collaborating with him during healing to this world I think your life's gonna be even better if you did that that's really really good I love that answer which leads us into the next question because for example I get a lot of messages like that it's like you know all these guys who still follow me from my old past previous lifestyle and they'll say well I hear from God is it like if I if I don't condemn or correct am I condoning like how do I because I personally know how to respond but many people are hearing don't know how to respond if I don't correct or condemn like I'm like okay well no you need to know that this is the truth that you need to be out of this relationship or if I condemn them you know just be like God is not gonna love like that year living in sin he's gonna send you to hell if I don't say those things in my condoning this and my approving of this if I just stay silent like how what's going on there in that situation yeah I don't I don't think I don't think silence necessarily means that you're you're condoning something again I I think we talked earlier about how Jesus is strategic in the gospels about his ministry you talked about having a sensitivity to the Holy Spirit about wins the right time to say what and I think that's I think that's the answer answer here you know if this is a close friend this is someone who you've gone to church with for a while or a Christian who has has asked you to hold them accountable then yeah I think we have a responsibility to kind of call each other out when we're in sin I think it's important that we don't treat this sin the the the sin of you know gay sex gay romance any different than any other sin so if you've been ignoring if you've got a Christian friend who you're close to but you've been ignoring others sin in their life and then all of a sudden this is part of the ways that they're falling short of God's standard you're all over them about this sin that's a little off right I mean why why why why taking this one more seriously than the rest so I think there's a consistency issue there that I've challenged somebody on because it's easy for the on the receiving end of that to think oh so you're not really serious about sin you just particularly hate gay people is an easy interpretation from that and and if someone gets that vibe that message um that's not going to leave them to Jesus that's going to push them farther away from Jesus so yeah listen to the Holy Spirit and and be consistent yeah and that's so good because I think you mentioned accountability in many times what I say or how I respond to people is not going to matter if I'm not in relationship with that individual and whether or not they ask me specifically to on on what what my thoughts my are about their specific relationship or whatever um if I haven't developed that like in sales they call it rapport right if I haven't developed that relationship with that individual um I'm not a mentor in their life I'm not a leader in their life they don't respect me from a biblical perspective or even maybe just from a friendship perspective then anything that I have to say or comment on their sin will not be received well you know um and so most times that's why it's so crucial to be like okay you know what before we get into that like so many people like want to just go directly right there you know with the root of the issue or what they think is the issue which is really not the issue um I would say let's let's really you know dive deeper into our relationships um let's dive deeper into whether or not you respect me enough to teach you on biblical terms and like you said let's not put a pedestal on sins you know let's not say oh this sin of homosexuality it has to be immediately dealt with and then you're sin of lying or you're sin of um drug use or whatever um because technically everything if we know everything done outside of faith is a sin so everything we do outside of faith is a sin every single day we sin every day as Christians so let's not try to just go immediately for that um the what I would say the the fruits of unrighteousness um let's dig down a little bit deeper into the roots yeah I mean there's and there's plenty of straight people in our churches who aren't taking with the Bible has to say about their sexuality seriously yes and our ignoring versus about um biblical divorce and remarriage or ignoring versus about um marriage being a space to raise kids or ignoring uh what is the clear implication of scripture when it comes to kind of casual romance outside of of marriage ignoring what the Bible has to say it's invitation to consider the singleness of Jesus and Paul um a lot of the straight Christians I know aren't taking what the Bible has to say about sexuality seriously so I encourage them to take care of their side of the street first and want that to clean uh they can come to my side of the street definitely yes I think there's um I I don't know if I would say hypocrisy um because I don't think anybody's like playing a part I think genuinely people are just confused over this topic and um our failing to recognize you know certain biblical truths um and it comes from our society and from our culture standards um so okay the next question that I have is um do you believe that if I were to die um in my unrepentance in like let's say for example I'm in a relationship with another man but I have confessed Jesus do you think that I would make it to heaven like what are your thoughts on that? Yeah I think so I mean so I mean how I understand salvation is that when we ask Jesus to be our Lord and Savior we recognize our our sinfulness and our need for a Savior what we're inviting him to do is to pay for all of our sins past present in future and we receive the Holy Spirit and the deal is done you know unless we clearly reject the Holy Spirit reject Jesus we're a now and so our faith um and a scripture says that God is faithful to keep us in His hands and so I think regardless of what unrepentance sin we may die with um Jesus will welcome will welcome us um I think so so then someone might ask well then why not just sin all you want because you know you're still gonna go to heaven well because sin still has consequences on this side of heaven it still has temporal effects and again I don't think God just arbitrarily said who gay sex looks fun I'm gonna call it bad so my Christian children have to prove to me they really love me you know I don't think that's what God did I think God ordered this world perfectly and then he gave us choice to choose to love him or not because our love would mean more if we could choose it and then eventually we chose not to love God and then and then sin entered the world and it bent and broke everything about this world and then God looked at the world again in light of this bentness in this brokenness in all the creation and he said mmm you know I can still see my order in here but I can also see all the ways now things are off and let me give you the scriptures um and that was my dog sorry she's making funny noises let me give you the the scriptures to clarify for you in light of my order and the brokenness of this world what things are good for you and what things will be pain and destruction to you so I say all that to say I think it's it it I I would recommend repenting of our sins regardless of what those sins are and and and and and and and and resisting temptation in the future because I really think you'll have more goodness and beauty and joy and true pleasure in life if you follow God's wisdom yeah and you know that is a really difficult question to answer and I think you did a fantastic job if someone were to ask me the exact same question I think at the end of the day I'm not God you know when I study the scriptures there's so many different theological you know debates even on things like this one saves always save our minis and Calvinism you know all these different understandings of what happens to someone if they are in the sin and they die in the sin you know but I think what what is the most important is for us to continually focus on okay if I am living for God and I have made that choice for me to live for God every single day I'm going to strive towards that and if I fail then that's okay because he's the good shepherd like he claims I don't think he would be a very good shepherd if every time we fail our our livingants is well you know he literally says I leave then I need to go after the one I don't think that he would be a very good shepherd if he didn't run after us or complete that process because I think he completes everything that he starts and so I I would like to believe and I may correct this later on in the future but I would like to believe that it really like he completes that sanctification process and so I don't think that he would allow for someone to die in their sins just abruptly without completing the work that he started in that individual that would be just like a weird God we serve but who knows you know maybe my opinion is my change later anyways I think that's like I have one more question and then I think we should be done so I have a lot of gay friends who hit me up and asked me and they tell me you know can I find goodness outside of God like can I this is maybe a little bit outside of the same sexual traction or gay thing but can I just get into vibrations or produce some type of goodness and not accredited to God like can I have good outside of God because most people would direct that into their relationships as well like I'm in a homosexual relationship and I have goodness in my relationship and you mentioned a little bit about you may have some good qualities in there but ultimately will we have that same goodness that God goodness outside of him? well okay so we know that like anything that is good God created it like God created the world perfectly good and then in light of the fall everything's a little bit off that doesn't mean that everything in the world is bad but it does mean nothing in the world is perfect but inherent in creation inherent in the way God made us in his image even though we've been corrupted by the fall there is still good in creation we are still capable of doing good in here and what God made us to be so what that means is is that people can experience good in creation even if they don't attribute it to God now ultimately God made that thing good right they no one can really experience anything good outside of God like no one can conjure good on their own no one can make good that God hasn't really himself made or made the formula for you know I'm saying or put the potential in creation for and if I do some kind of good if I kind of if I if I you know help a lady cross the street even if I don't give Jesus credit God credit for for making me any his image to want to do good things that's still the reality still the reason why I'm able I have any motivation to serve any one other of myself is because I was made in God's image and that's inherent in me but I do think it's I do think it's true that like the best things come from God right and and ultimately eternal life only comes from God and that's the best best thing and I think compared to eternal life really good sex or a really good cocktail or a really good cigarette or a job that makes $300,000 a year those things are tiny I mean those things are meaningless compared to eternal life and I don't think they're worth the trade now I'm not saying that in order to get eternal life you can enjoy nothing good and nothing pleasurable in this life that's not true right because so there's this is there's still goodness you know in following God God's wisdom so yeah I think that's how that's answer the question of can we experience good outside of God God has made everything good and the best things only come from God yeah I think we we live in a fallen world where he established goodness at some point exactly like you just said it you were perfectly and so people can tap into that in this current moment because we're living in the midst of evil and then also good we have the knowledge of both evil and good so even if we don't a credit that good to God he created it it's there it's established even if you want to recognize or acknowledge that it's from him but that will one day and when finally he comes down he brings the judgment and he does what he needs to do um right now we're living in that weird messed up all in world but he's gonna come to correct that one day and then that's where we will find that perfectness that beautiful glorified bodies that will be given and stuff in that sort of um way but anyways um I just want to give you like a round of applause these are these are very hard questions guys and I'm so thankful to just if you haven't already please please please go check out equip your community it is guys like how I said it can sometimes come off as um maybe a little bit um I don't know what's the word to use like a little bit more free from the um usual perspective that we would normally see from Christians um there's a lot more empathy there's a lot more patience there's a lot more room for interpretation and I think they do that deliberately but their message is just beautiful and when I when I found um equip your community I believe that that's what it's called on Instagram I'll link all that stuff down below I was like this is a beautiful message and um they're doing really beautiful work here um we may have different approaches like I'm very different in my approach than Peters and his approach I have not had nearly the amount of studies and education like him and I'm like I focus on a different generation and he's focused on parents and uh ministry leaders and so of course we're gonna have different approach and we're gonna be doing different things but guys please go check out the resources that they're doing a lot of times I get so many messages of people who are asking me um oh about all of these questions that we just finished talking about and they're like do you know where I could go do you know where I can get some type of help and resource like go check them out go check their page you know um add a Peter on Instagram or whatever um I think you will be pleasantly surprised with the work that they are producing um and yeah or if you don't want to you know don't do it but anyways I'm so thankful to have you on Peter and yeah I just want to continue to encourage you that I think you are doing a fantastic job and you really are going to be reaching certain lives that are just what never hear the gospel would never experience to love a God had it not been for a ministry like you and I think you're pointing them into a really really great direction. Oh thank you so much I mean thank and thank you for like letting me be a part of this podcast and having this conversation these are important questions uh and ultimately like we want everyone to know Jesus right and yeah there's those multiple strategies for how how to do do that well and I just pray that we're all faithful to the particular work that God is calling us to. For sure exactly guys we have to be and we have to understand that we are not in war towards one another we are not like as the body of Christ things are going to look different a hand is going to look very different than a feed and a nose is going to look different than a lip you know um and so don't necessarily push aside the things that maybe are confusing to you or um different than ministries around you or the way that you've grown up um and brace it you know I'm see the good parts that are in there um the deeper and see okay how can I pray for this ministry how can I support this ministry um biblically or whatever um I think we need to we really need a lot more of togetherness especially as the body of Christ is for the world to recognize oh I want to be a part of this these people genuinely love each other they're trying to do good works so yeah from my audience to his audience it's going to be interesting for us to to pray for one another and to encourage one another because we have one goal which is to know Jesus and to let everybody else also get to have a relationship with Jesus but anyways guys this podcast has gone on long enough thank you so much for tuning in and for joining us throughout the whole episode if you made it all the way to the end so we'll see you around next time guys peace out
