 This episode is part two of an interview with Peter Valk, all about sexuality, Christian sexual ethics, same sex attraction, and what that looks like for the Christian church. In part one, if you haven't heard it, please go back and listen to it. It's so good. A little bit about Peter, he is a writer and speaker about discernment, vocational singleness and Christian sexual ethics. He's the director of a quip, which is a consulting and training ministry for churches to help gay people thrive according to the biblical sexual ethic. He is a teacher and aspiring deacon in the English and church in North America. He's one of the founding brothers of the Nashville family of brothers, which is a new monastery of sorts building family for men called to kingdom singleness. And he's also a licensed professional counselor. And Peter doesn't excellent job in the previous episode of laying out his heart and his vision for helping gay people follow Jesus and find love and support and belonging within the church, but also his commitment to helping them do that within the framework of theological orthodoxy and commitment to the historic Christian sexual ethic of God's design for marriage and sex between one man and one woman. And he just absolutely nails it. I mean, if you don't go back and listen to part one, it's probably going to make it hard for you to fully understand and appreciate part two. Because in part two, we're diving straight into some of the pushback that Peter has received, not just in general, but specifically from pastors and leaders from within our movement here of C.G.N. You know, I reached out to some of my pastor friends who I'd love and respect and told them that I was going to be doing an interview with Peter. And not many of them new Peter very well are understood his ministry so naturally. They had some questions and even after doing some first glancing at some of the things Peter had to say on social media, there was even some pushback. And I think that's the kind of thing that can be a little scary, a little tense, a little like, oh, I don't know how this is going to go, but I just have to say Peter was so gracious to jump to the chance to answer some of these questions and pushbacks with so much truth and grace and love. It's beautiful. I'm so impressed with this guy. I think he does a phenomenal job. In this episode, we get into it. We get into some of that pushback. We talk about what it's like for Peter to deal with people being skeptical about his ministry because of his sexuality. And then specifically, we get into, man, just there was some really good pushback that got sent in. Things like, what does Peter have to say about people in the side-be sexuality movement? Sometimes the lionizing the gay identity and propping up gay Christians to almost to celebrity status. Another great question we got is, is gay sexual sin worse than straight sexual sin? We're going to hear Peter thoughts on that. We're also going to deal with the very big and very common pushback in this conversation about why does Peter use the term gay Christian, isn't that misleading or stumbling? What's the reason behind it? We're even going to deal with some pushback that actually came from me personally at the end of the episode. And hopefully Peter and I are going to do a good job of modeling what it looks like for two ministry leaders to disagree on something in a way that's gracious and an example of iron, sharpening iron. I think we did a good job. I'll leave you guys to be the judge. Overall, I thought this was a phenomenal conversation. I so enjoyed it. I think you are going to as well. So with that, why don't we jump right into the episode? We're going to pick it back up from where we left off in part one and we're going to start diving into some of the pushback that Peter has received around his ministry. Peter, I think anybody who's listening this far is probably really blessed with what you're saying, really encouraged by what you're saying. I want to jump into some pushback. Potentially healthy pushback. How does that sound? Sure. Yeah, sure. I've been speaking to some pastors that I know in friends, we better end the Calvary movement. I would say our movement has recognized that there are problems within our churches, historic problems where we have not addressed this well. We have not done this well. We have not reached out to get people historically well. I think that for many of us Preston Sprinkle was kind of the gateway of opening some of our eyes. A lot of guys a few years ago read the book, People to Be Loved by Preston Sprinkle. That was really encouraging for a lot of us and just kind of making us realize like this is a problem. We haven't handled this the best. How can we handle this better? But I think just in the cultural moment with all of the political stuff going on and just all of these conversations, a lot of guys have their guard up to some things and I think looking at your ministry. I don't know if you experience this, but I'm sure you do, but I'm sure that when you try to do what you do with a clip, let me just start with this question. When you try to do what you do with a clip, do you feel like a lot of people are in times you feel like there's walls up that you have to break down with people where maybe they assume certain things about your ministry at first glance. They might assume like, oh, you know, because there is the word gay. Just simply the word gay. In this sentence, they're assuming that you take a progressive Christian stance or a the logically liberal stance. Do you find that you have to deal with those barriers? Yeah, and I think I get it kind of from both directions. And some of it is, I guess it is reasonable, right? Like, it would not be reasonable for me to assume or for me to demand that every person who stumbles upon anything that I've written or anything about me on the internet would then spend 30 minutes reading an explainer article on my website, the clarifies each of the tricky things that they might understand, right? Right. That would not be reasonable for me to demand. And so people are going to take a quick glance and based on all of their previous life experiences and what these words and what these things have meant that people have used in the past are going to make a quick judgment, a quick assessment of who I might be. And that's just kind of how humans work. Like, it's it's efficient even if it times inaccurate. So yeah, I get a lot of that from both directions. And I think that's why I part of my job is to be patient with that and to take the time to clarify. And I think that's because I represent this kind of middle way between two extremes of the revisionist kind of sexual ethics on one extreme and the ex-gay theology on the other extreme. And I don't know if this, what I would call compassionate orthodoxy in the middle, has been built out enough. To where the average Christian knows what the platform is, you know, what the talking points are for someone who finds themselves in that middle space. They know what the talking points are for revisionist sexual ethic. They know what the talking points are for ex-gay theology. But the stuff in the middle, it's it's it's not as built out. It's not as crystallized. It's not as kind of uniform and well marketed, you know? And so yeah, people don't know what they're getting into when they when they interact with me. And so I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm willing and eager to clarify. Well I'm glad that you have thick skin. I can tell that you you've developed that and and I I love what you're saying about that that humble orthodoxy in the middle. I think that's beautiful and that's a huge value that we at the show try to carry is you know that that humble orthodoxy. Let me give you some specific pushbacks that came to the end of the show. And I'm not going to like name them. Oh, I know who they are, but you know, I I look at all these guys and it's like I respect them some of them, you know, I would say are a little bit more conservative than me in the sense of not not in theology, but more just methodology turn that's okay. And I try to learn from them and I try that's why I'm that's why I'm presenting some of these pushbacks because I want to know what you think and I want to know is their validity to these to these pushbacks. So here's one from a guy that this guy leans a little bit more reformed Calvinist a friend of mine and he said that he recently went to a conference from kind of a more Calvinistic theological background where they really were pushing back, not necessarily against you, but just against against more I think, you know, maybe re-voiced, you know, the the re-voiced conference and some of the things around that and some of the side A side B stuff. And the thing that my friend specifically said in this pushback, this is kind of his takeaway coming from that conference. He said, why are we lionizing gay Christians and treating them like celebrities and heroes? In his perception that that's what he thinks is starting to happen. Why are we lionizing gay Christians and treating them like celebrities and heroes just because they resist temptation. Every Christian resist temptation. You don't see a celebrating people who resist the urge to commit adultery or due drugs. No, we just know that those things are sinful and we are expected not to do those things. How would you respond to him? Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. I would love to be a part of a church where experiencing same sex attraction is an ordinary temptation that is treated an ordinary way. I would love that. I would love to not be special. And that's actually the goal of my ministry is for, you know, if my God son, ends up developing same sex attractions for it for it to be clear what God's wisdom is about that and to be clear that that is a brokenness, but for that to be no big deal. So my hunch is that the reason why there's a lot of interest in, you know, myself and some of my kind of colleagues and peers who maybe get a lot of air time and have kind of larger platforms around these topics is because at least a meaningful part of American of Christians in America know that our churches are not yet places where ordinary for people to struggle with same sex attractions. Where we are only a couple years removed from the pray the gateway movement and ex-game movement that led to millions of people leaving the faith or committing suicide. They know that our churches are still not places where there are the resources, the practical support for same sex attraction people to thrive according to a historic sexual ethics. Our churches are not protecting kids from the wounds of the closet. Our churches are not holding straight people to the same high standard of sexual stewardship that we're holding gay people to. Our churches are not places where anyone can thrive in the kind of seamless that Jesus and Paul talk about in Matthew 19 of First Corinthians 7. So when that day comes, when our churches are doing that right and we're still celebrating the stories of people like me, and ordinantly, then I'll be the first to delete my Instagram profile and my Twitter account and say these followers are unhelpful for the witness of the church. Yeah. Today they're needed. I think that's fair. And I think that I see you responding to a very specific need. And I think that that is something that Jesus wants people in ministry to do. There are specific needs that need to be responded to. And there are some of us that are dealing with the general audience that we're not going to have that same ministry, but I think our ministry should be informed by people like you to help us realize, okay, maybe there's some gaps. Maybe I haven't in my general ministry been realizing that there are a percentage of people within my body that struggle with this and I need to up my game on how I reach them. So I appreciate that. I appreciate your comments on that. I have dear friends that are pastors and they like you and me are nonaffirming in their theology, but they are trying to make their churches a place where same-sex attracto Christians can thrive. And that doesn't mean that where there's sinful actions are affirmed for anybody. What it does mean that they want their churches to be a place where broken people are loved and embraced and people who are tempted to sin in a same sexual way are treated with the same respect and dignity as someone tempted to sin in a heterosexual way. Both sides are allowed to be open and honest about their struggles. Both sides are continually pointed to repentance and dying to self. And I've seen some gay Christians celebrated in those circles. I've seen them brought up to share their testimony and the pastor really like, you know, kind of praises them. But what I'm realizing, and this is just my own reflection, what I'm realizing is in the context of these pastors that I respect doing this, they aren't celebrating those people because they're gay. They're celebrating them because of their dedication to vocational singleness, celifacies serving Jesus with their whole life and modeling for others what death to self looks like in a culture of this worship of pleasure. So that's how I see it and I even told my friend that I kind of text them back and I was like, I don't see it that way. I don't see it as, you know, maybe in other churches but with the people that we know in respect, it's not a celebration of homosexuality. It's a celebration of like, here is somebody who's modeling what it looks like to follow Christ, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And maybe to give that, you know, the person who asked that question a little bit of credit, you know, are there some churches out there that technically hold a historic sexual ethic but seem to be hedging their bets on them a little bit, seeing the little embarrass about it and maybe you're a very pretty culturally progressive context and are trying to score some credibility points with kind of the what surrounds them and so our, our maybe platforming some, you know, gay Christians committed to a historic sexual ethic, particularly maybe gay Christians committed to a historic sexual ethic that visually code as being the most culturally gay and then kind of platforming them as kind of a prop to kind of prove their progressive bonifides to their kind of surrounding culture. And then like not actually taking steps in private to become a church where gay Christians committed to a historic sexual ethic and thrive according to God's wisdom does that happen in some places? Yeah. Wow. And so if that's what he's criticizing then that's fair. Dude, I love your charity, like towards the putt fact. That's, that's so, this has been probably one of the most balanced interviews we've ever had on the show. So, I appreciate you, man. Let me throw another one at you. That was a great response to them. So, here's another one from a friend of mine. So his concern was in this conversation about same sexual sin, same sex attraction, all that stuff, he said, yeah, same, this is his view, his theology says same sexual sin is worse than straight sexual sin because in the Bible it's listed as an abomination. It's important that we keep teaching that we don't want the severity of it to be less and in people's minds. How would you respond to that? Do you think same sexual sin is worse than straight sexual sin? Yeah, so I think it's tricky to know what to do, particularly with some of the political laws. There's a lot of things that, on the political laws, call abomination, some of which we believe was ritual purity, law, some of which we believe was moral, law, some of which we treat with the same weightiness today, some of which we don't. Here's the way I would parse that out. Do I think that, and I'll go back to the blindness analogy from earlier, do I think that a person who is completely blind, their blindness is more broken than a person who deals with near sightedness or far sightedness? Yeah, like they're, in that particular, that one part of like whole person that they are, that one part is more broken, is farther from God's first intentions than the other. Yeah. So, is it the case that on average people who experience same sex attraction, their sexuality is more broken, is farther from God's intentions than the average person who experiences opposite sex attractions? I think that's true. Now, I don't mean that to say that the same sex attraction people commit more sexual sin or they are more morally corrupt, but I just mean like, is my sexual orientation farther from God's first intentions? For me, then if I experienced exclusively opposite sex attractions, I think, I think we, I think would be you. I think, theologically, we have to recognize that that is true. Now, are there, are there exceptions to that rule, right? Are there some, I suppose the opposite sex attraction people, but then they have some temptations for some other things, to agree that some total their sexual orientation, maybe even more broken than mine is, yeah, those people exist, we don't need to go through a list of what those added on factors might be. Just to interject that's kind of where my brain went was like, I think what you're kind of throwing in like a hierarchy of brokenness, which, sure, sure. I think there's a reality to that. There's a created order, so it's like obviously anything that is different from that creative order is going to be further left, further to the left of the center of where God's trying to get us, but in my mind, it's like a same sex-attracted Christian who is like, I am committed to a life of celibacy and I'm following Jesus and I'm resisting temptation, I've got accountability, all that stuff versus a straight Christian who is like just sleeping around and committing adultery all over the place. I'd say that the straight person's a little bit more sexually broken on the scale, if that makes sense, but because it's kind of like, where's your starting point, but then where are you because of your actions of that? That's your sense. I see it as the spectrum, I guess, but I would tend to agree with you in the core principle of it in the starting point, if you take out everyone's actions and it's just where they're starting, somebody with the same sex attraction's going to be a little bit more disinvantage for sure. Yeah, yeah, so yeah, when we're comparing how broken is this, how far is this from God's first intentions, that's a manchard there, so then, but comparing kind of actual sin, you know, I think the scenarios that in my mind are helpful to compare is, okay, think about two pairs of high schoolers and one pair are the high school quarterback and the leader of the cheerleading team and both, excuse me, opposite sex attraction, both the most attractive people in their school, perhaps both Christians, they show up to FCA every Thursday morning and they lead prayer sometimes and they let's come and then a turn tofully consider a pair of two, you know, kind of odd ball guys in the theater club and in the gay straight alliance who are both exclusively, same sex attraction and they don't feel welcome at FCA, but maybe they both believe in God, they both accepted Jesus Christ to their personal Lord and Savior, you know, when they were younger, they're not sure what to do with all this faith and sexuality stuff, but they're also believers, okay, and on the same weekend, on the same Friday night, the quarterback and the cheerleader have sex after the quarterback wins a football game and the two theater guys in the gay straight alliance, it up hanging out at one of their houses together and sleeping over and they also have sex. I don't think God is any more displeased with one of those than the other. Yeah, yeah, I think they both equally fall short of God's best for his people. It's like we always start getting into this weird scale of God's displeasure, to me what it smells of, it almost comes from a place of self-righteousness of, you know, the Pharisee looking at the tax collector and being like, you know, thank you Lord, I'm not like him. Instead of pushing people for that heightened sense of awareness of our sexual brokenness, but it is good, I mean, you did call out on the beginning, like, yeah, there is this order, there is this hierarchy, but I think I just want to go single in on the whole abomination thing, because to me, like, I tend to lean more towards what's called biblical theology versus systematic theology, and so that's looking at the medinarrative of scripture and looking at everything in this holistic way instead of hunting and pecking for specific verses that systematically say you can or can't do such and such things. So for me, like, when I think about what is an abomination at its core, it's something that got hates, you know, sin, like, Alson really isn't an abomination if you think about it, but you know, the proper 16th or 19th has that list. Seven things, which are abominations, hot eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift, running to mischief, a false witness who utteres lies, and one who spreads strife among the brothers, to me, like, I recognize that the Bible says that practicing same sexual sin is an abomination. But I also look at all those other things on the list, and I'm like, okay, heterosexual adultery may not be called an abomination of the Bible with those exact words, but you can't get to adultery without hitting pretty much everything on that proper of six list. Like, right, hot eyes is looking down on others. It's like, I deserve to take this woman from her husband, you know, bringing the woman and yourself into lies and deception, you know, to plan to have adultery is literally to devise a wicked scheme. It's feet running to mischief, and it's literally spreading strife. So it's like, hot, got them all. Yeah, it's like, I mean, except for hands that shed innocent blood was the old one there. We didn't hit, but it's just trying to say, I just think we need to be more balanced. That's the thing. I'm not saying that we should take any sin less seriously. And I think that's what you're pushing for is you say we need to take all of this sin extremely seriously. Whether it's straight or gay, we need to have a raise the bar. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Let me go on to another pushback that I think will be an important one. So the terminology of gay Christian, why do you use that terminology? Because I know that's a sensitive one, and there are people that are frustrated with that terminology. And they wish that people would just say same sex-attracted Christian. Yeah, I mean, I totally understand the concern, and the words we use do matter, and I'm sure we can include in the show notes kind of a lengthy explainer that is on my website and it quits website about why we use the terminology we use, but in a nutshell, I don't think that there's any phrase or word to use in this conversation that is clear to every audience and without baggage with every audience. I think both the word gay and the phrase same sex attraction are either unclear or curie baggage with every audience. And that's the challenge. So when some people hear me use the word gay, and they understand that word to mean people who all do drugs and go to group sex parties and have AIDS and one on the thing to do with Jesus. And that's what I grew up hearing the word gay means, but if you ask a middle school or a high school or today what the word gay means, they would say a boy who likes boys or a girl who likes girls. With no assumptions about their theological convictions or their their behavior patterns internally, they use the phrase same sex attraction, there may be some who would say, well hey that's just kind of self-evident it just means as much as little as what it says a person who experiences same sex attraction is a person who experiences same sex attraction. Why don't we just use that right? But for others, for anyone who for any LGBT plus people who have been around since the 80s or who are aware of the history of the ex-gay movement or the prairie gay way movement, they know that the phrase same sex attraction was popularized by the prairie the gay way movement. And for many gay people, Christian and not, that phrase is associated with the millions of people who left the fate or committed suicide because of the prairie gay way of movement. It's associated with a consistent research that shows that that 96% of people who attend sexual orientation change efforts, experience no change in their sexual orientation. But they did experience a doubled risk of suicide attempts. And other disturbing practices that were in shaming practices and misuses of the Holy Spirit that were used in those spaces. And so the prairie seems to be extraction here is a lot of baggage for some people. So there's no perfect term for ministry to LGBT plus non-Christians and gay teens in your church and straight culture warriors in your church. There's no term that all of those people will be affected with all of those people. And so essentially, I think anyone doing ministry in this around these topics is going to have to choose something, knowing they were going, it's going to work for some people and it's going to offend some other people. And then be willing to do the work of talking to the people who you're going to offend by using that phrase or terminology and hopefully clear things up enough. So for me, my primary audience, my first audience, particularly when it comes to public ministry that I do, are young adults and teens who are LGBT plus or who are straight, but are trying to figure out how they think about God's love and wisdom for LGBT plus people. And for that audience, the best words to use are the words that all of their peers use. Gay LGBT plus sexual minority, gender minority, queer, non-strait, all these kinds of things so that language is not a barrier to the much more important conversation we need to have about sexual ethics and about God's wisdom and about what our church is going to be doing to become places of thriving for people who want to follow God's wisdom. But I also recognize that by using those words, there's going to be some people who see that and have that understanding of the word gay that I had growing up and don't have, don't understand how the phrase same-tox attraction is connected to the pray they gay away movement and so don't understand why I don't just use that phrase instead and I understand why they would be suspicious and I just I hope that they you know will listen to this podcast and hear this explanation but often when I'm speaking you know a person to an audience where I know a majority people the audience are going to have the would have those hesitations, would have those suspicions of me if I use certain terminology I will choose to use the terminology that it's most helpful for them to hear I'll choose to just use the phrase same-sex attraction for example so but it's tricky because when we're in a way public you know everybody's reading it so yeah dude that wow what a great response honestly really really really good really balanced I I'm blessed by it I hear your heart and the heart that I hear is your missionary and every missionary needs to study the culture that they're called the missionary too they need to learn the language and how to speak the language of the people that they're trying to reach yeah and so for me like what it comes down to is like yes words have meanings meanings have words all that stuff is true but at the heart of it it's what do we believe what's our theology around this stuff and to me if someone's gonna write you off because they think that you use the wrong word without hearing your heart behind why to me that's that's just unfortunate I think the language part of things is difficult I think like just to be honest most of us straight pastors still struggle to figure out like what terminology to use for anything and a lot of us do it very clumsy I'm sure you know there there is a thing recently where I had a friend actually reached out to me because he was upset about something I said I'm trying to see if I can remember it correctly but it was like it was one friend of mine who was a pastor was mad and another friend of mine who's a pastor because my friend who is a pastor was sharing something on social media about how the church needs to love you know those in the gay community and obviously this guy is non affirming he's been clear about that his entire ministry career but in the comments I said something about just our need as the church to stand up and be like hey even though we're not affirming we need to love the LGBTQ plus community and my friend message me and was like hey you know that by using that plus you're actually talking about pedophilia and in my mind I was like that's not what I was thinking I was saying it all but in his mind that's what the plus means so can you speak to that at all like just the complexity of the language around this is very challenging for people and obviously in the secular realm that acronym is constantly getting longer so how can you encourage people to navigate that wisely yeah I I did not know but the plus means that maybe it means that to some people maybe he doesn't maybe he heard that on some talk radio show I don't know what what is that stand for in your mind so the plus means so when I'm referring just to people who experience same sex attraction I might use the word gay or I might say lesbian gay and bisexual people or I might say sexual minorities sexual minorities then actually includes asexual people so it goes a little it's a little bit more including a people than just gay or LGBT then as the other side of the alphabet that's related to people's experience of their gender and their gender identity and their gender expression and so for me it does get pretty overwhelming all of the things you have to list in order to be fully inclusive and so I've just found it helpful to just kind of decide LGBT and then I'm just gonna put the plus there right like I remember a coworker and I were saying should it be LGBT plus or LGBT Q plus or LGBT plus or you know it's something you just gotta choose one of the years for me the plus just means and there's other people who consider themselves sexual minorities who maybe included in this list of people yeah so I had it I remember having a girl in the youth group who you know she was asexual so she was like I have no attraction to anybody and for and she was getting into some of the more the ways that the secular culture was framing things she was you know getting into that and so for her she considered herself a part of that plus sure yeah yeah I think I think my friend is probably off there and being a little reactionary but I do think it's wise to be careful and what I'm trying to do is what I'm trying to learn from is to not just grab the entire acronym but focus more on who am I actually talking about like right now and I'm saying this like whoa yeah and I just am I talking about everybody or am I saying something that's specific to gay lesbian and by people so yeah that's that's just been for me what I've been trying to do but it is true yeah yeah and two of the things that might be helpful for me to clarify when it comes to terminology is you know particularly when we have this kind of conversation one is to say that when I used to were gay I am not using that word to identify with my same sex attractions or to identify with gay sex certainly not doing that I am using that word to identify with other people who have had a shared experience I'm using a particularly to identify with other people who have had the shared experience of of being in the closet for five plus years yeah and and having to learn how to share their story fully with the people who care for them and how I'm a reconcile important things like faith and sexuality and and I'm particularly using that word to identify with other Christians who experience same sex attraction who have submitted that in jury brokenness to Jesus and as a result it's been a source of beauty in their life and a source of faithfulness and a source of a source of of of having something to offer the body of Christ despite their brokenness and thanks to their faithfulness and thanks to Christ faithfulness and in their sanctification so that's when I'm using the word gay that's what I'm using the word gay to do I also want to clarify that I'm I am using the word gay phenomenologically not ontologically so when we define something phenomenologically we're naming something from the word phenomena you know we're naming something based on one's experience or what it appears to be in contrast when we ask like a who a person is ontologically we're asking who are they in lately by design we're talking about ontology we're talking about God's intentions so when I use the word gay I am not saying that I or someone else is ontologically gay I'm not saying that I am a fundamentally different person or the God intended for me to be gay I'm nearly noticing that I'm attracted to other people of the same sex and I'm using the most common word particularly among my first audience of ministry to describe that kind of person that makes a lot of sense man I think you you are so clear you're you're so good I'm I'm just learning as someone who's meeting you're talking to you you're so good at bringing clarity to a very complex and often confusing discussion so I just appreciate that gift that you have one thing that comes to my mind in this is you know I'm thinking about how all of these tensions we have around the word gay in the church there's so much political and cultural baggage that comes with it that often like informs and fuels our debate but I was thinking about like you know if if I made a parallel to divorce you know and it's like a like if I met someone at a church and they identified as like hey yeah I'm divorced I'm a divorced person similar to homosexuality and my mind at least divorces an identity that someone carries with them that is tied to the fall like it wouldn't exist if it wasn't for sin and for the fall sure but when I meet somebody at my church who is described by themselves or someone else is a divorce person or they self identify as a divorced person so I usually give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they know that divorce in most cases is a sin you know I assume that whatever happened this this is just my gut reaction like if I meet a divorce person in church I'm assuming whatever happened with their divorce whether it was their fault or their spouse's father shared blame I assume that they if they did sin they've repented and they're doing their best follow Jesus and submit to him and and the place my mind goes is you know is there a future a possibility where we can get to the place where if we meet someone in church and they have that identifier of of gay we don't instantly jump to the conclusion like oh so they must be sleeping around with other men or other women but instead we jump to the conclusion we give them that benefit of the doubt but that just seems it seems like that is a future that's so distant because I know where we've been and what the experience has been it's like how do we get there you know yeah I mean I think it's a funny is a little conservative often complain about virtue signaling they would say that you know more culturally progressive people do but this is an example of virtue signaling that is happening among cultural Christians that whether you use the phrase same six attraction or the phrase gay is a is is is is is is is is a virtue signal or at least concert cultural cultural Christians wanted to be a virtue signal I believe in avoiding virtue signaling and virtue signaling being silly but I think then we need to call our virtual virtue signaling in all directions so that's can victing man I mean I'm just processing through what you just said and it's like I know that I tend to use the term same sex attracted trend the reason that I do and maybe it's virtue signaling but the reason I do is because I know my audience and I know I know the assumptions that they bring to the table if I say gay Christian sure sure so I say same sex attracted Christian as a way to not have to stop and pause what I'm doing and overexplain every single time I say it if that makes sense I mean it be honest with me is that am I am I virtue signaling and then you know if so what's the what's the solution? I think I really does depend on your audience but you know I think for me because I know how because I know there is a lot of work to do with offering gods wisdom for gay people and in body in that in ways that leads to thriving and faithfulness because there's a lot of work to do there I I choose to use and it's not only because of of of an age difference but but regardless of age I think I want to use the language that maybe was the right word that accommodates them first like if I'm gonna if if I'm gonna what language I use it's gonna be it's gonna be more appealing to some and more of the barrier to others and and if and if and if I mean if cultural conservatives believe that LGBT plus people are less church and less Christian people and need to be reached with the gospel well then if if if if if we believe that this a greater need for for evangelism there then then wouldn't we then choose to use the language that would be most effective for evangelism and then choose to make uncomfortable believers in our church and and explain to them hey I know you do this for languages confusing but we're using it to be effective for evangelism and and and and and a good on you for being willing to kind of of endure a little bit of discomfort here for the sake of the gospel isn't that what we do with everything else when it comes to evangelism we we we we we we we we see it as something that we should be proud to do as believers to take on a little bit of discomfort for the sake of the gospel being able to reach a people who can't reach right now why don't we I get my right now that's whole other conversation as to whether LGBT plus people are less church people or they are more and more need of the gospel than straight people but if does the assumption there's always coming into this with then which and we be eager to to be effective in evangelism you know so anyway yeah no I mean I wholeheartedly agree with that I mean and for those people listening who you know we've got our Calvary background with Chuck Smith and the 60s and the hippies I mean we we know like that our founder and Calvary was this guy who was willing he didn't look at the hippies and say I want them to use the language I use I want them to dress how I dress I want them to cut their long hair and put on a shirt and you know no like he adapted he was like I'm going to invite the hippies in and they don't have to put on a shirt like they they they can wear their hair long let's get some hippies to play music in the worship band to contextualize the gospel to them and what they're going through and it's not about compromising theology it's about right adapting to the audience for what their need is so I think I love that you're not being dogmatic about any like pretty much everything we've been talking about you haven't been like well you have to say this or you have to say that you can't say this you can't say that you've been very you've been pointing us to kind of that fluidity of not changing our theology but adapting our methods to reach specific groups of people and I I for want to appreciate that music Peter this has been absolutely fantastic this has been a great conversation you know and and I've just been honestly so blessed by your heart and and I'm somebody that's still learning and processing and so you know as I as I read your stuff and look at it there's there's so many things I'm like yes that is my heart I love that there's there's a few things sometimes I read where I'm like man I don't know if I'm there yet I don't know if I fully agree about that methodology piece but like regardless of disagreements over methodology I feel like as far as heart goes I am an utter agreement with your heart of reaching this demographic and of carrying the historic Christian sex ethic without compromise but also like bending over backwards to show love to others so I just appreciate you so much and I I want to share the final pushback to end up the episode and this one actually comes from me I'm just gonna own it like this is not from a friend not I'm not asking for a friend this is something that I saw and I just kind of was like I'm not sure about that I want to ask Peter that for some clarity so you did a post on social media about shame which is like a massive issue for anybody just as a as a former youth pastor like I just know the shame piece is so hard for any young person struggling with sexual sin but I you know I see I see gay lesbian by young people struggling with so much shame from them especially in the church and so you know I know from reading your stuff there's a balance between understanding that sexual sin is wrong but also the burden of people walking in shame about the temptations they have so you shared this post about shame and you had this model and the first two parts of it I really resonated with you said you know number one share your story so confession of sin and or struggle to those who are safe and will love you and support you and encourage you and not a firm your sin but they'll they'll point you to Christ I thought that was great and then number two was you know overcoming shame heal your past memories so detangling what you call appropriate guilt with destructive shame I think that's brilliant like because I think you know the the more secular more left leaning realm would just say don't feel bad about anything like don't have shame about anything just be yourself I I love that you recognize like there's appropriate guilt but there's also destructive shame here was my struggle just where I had like a check in my heart when I read it where I was like I don't know man you have this part where you said see yourself in art give permission you're you're just speaking to same sex attracted and in gay Christians here give permission to listen to music and watch movies where gay characters are portrayed as normal while avoiding any sexual or romantic content that may be unhelpful here's the thing if I were to recommend your ministry to pastors and my tribe for many of them if they were stumble on that post that would probably cause a lot of confusion for them and I know just from what we talked about like they're not your target audience I totally truth that but to them here's how I feel like it kind of reads like hey if you struggled with the adultery in your past we want to help you recognize the sin but move past the shame so allow yourself to see yourself represented in media watch shows that normalize people that have committed adultery do you kind of see the tension there like do you think that's an exaggeration how would you respond to somebody like me who kind of is like man I don't know about that sure yeah so I think there's a way maybe if I talk to some people who do consider our married but consistently experience the temptation to to cheat on their spouse maybe there is a way that they feel like it is it is it is ever present in their daily experience in a way that it is it could be just as meaningful a thing to kind of identify with or there's a or such it is just as meaningful a part of their personhood is my same sex attraction has been but I think one of the things that's way that's different is that our culture, Christian and not treats them very differently so in the 30s and then 40s and 50s and 60s and then beyond you know culturally conservative spaces including churches told gay people we don't want to in our spaces go away go create your own communities and so they did yeah and in order to to survive they created kind of a culture of round their kind of survival and enduring together and and you know many of these those people were committing sexual sin I'm not like I'm not you know ignoring that but they also were enduring hate crimes and physical abuse and and discrimination when it comes to housing and employment lots of horrible things and all these developments with that yeah yeah so there's this way that culturally sexual identity particularly is a sexual minority has this this all these cultural artifacts and this whole momentum around it that being up of of having divorced does not now those are not inherent those are culturally created right yeah but there is something in the soup of American culture that gives sexual identity being a sexual minority this extra stuff that that that that having been divorced doesn't have associated with it so what I as a person who experiences sex attraction if everything else was the same but I could have choose to flip a switch and I grew up in an America where all of that cultural power around being sex attraction didn't exist what I prefer that absolutely right but I grew up in the soup that I did where it where when I was told over and over again by progressives but also by conservatives that it meant a lot about me that I was getting and so because of that maybe that's how it's a little bit different that I'm at some core level it's been based into me that this is a really meaningful part of my personhood and at the same time it's been baked into me from the particularly the lives of the enemy that that I should be ashamed and that I'm not worth God's love and not worth the love of my brothers and sisters and Christ because of that part of my person yeah and because of that it's been helpful for me to watch some movies or listen to some music where the characters are not engaging in sexual center or even in romantic activity but they it's clear that they are same sex attracted and they and and you as the audience are led to empathize with them yeah so I think of like the movie the person being a wallflower or the movie boy erased neither of which have any sexual content and and at least some of the gay characters know meaningful like romantic content and I could watch those movies and and see myself in in a way in those characters and my heart empathizes for those characters and their brokenness and their pain and their struggle and then it's fine I find it a little easier to empathize for myself and ultimately what I'm trying to do is re-teach myself how to see myself the way Jesus does right how to have tenderness towards myself in the way Jesus does that's what I'm trying to relearn and and and thus that's the goal with that for me but again I totally get how that there's plenty of stuff content out there that would be unhelpful for me to see and I understand how this is very very nuanced and maybe alarm me to see in a quick two sentence snippet right through post that that's the thing it's like if my first exposure to you is not even that whole post but someone just sends me that slide of that post it's like wait what but I appreciate hearing your heart the the place that my mind is going to and it that is connecting the dots for me and I know that we you know alcoholism or drug addiction you know is not a correct parallel but I think in in this instance like if there was somebody out there who you know had battled drug addiction and and and the way that they had seen drug addicted people in the media was always like they're the worst or the worst or the worst or the lowest or the lowest of the earth you know and then they watch a movie where it's not glorifying drug addiction but it's just depicting somebody that is battling that struggle and that temptation not even a Christian movie but just like showing somebody where it's like man there is a central part of their character conflict that has them dealing with this there can be a resignation where it's like whoa like here's a hero in a movie that struggles with the same thing I do and what I see you're doing Peter is you're trying to get people somewhere and there's a path that you're taking them to get there and that path has like windy roads and many steps but the when I look at the whole of your ministry like if if I'm uneducated about it I can look at that post and think oh so Peter his end game is to get people to the point where they normalize same sexual sin and they think it's fine and it's not sinful and whatever and that's just not true because when you look at the whole of your ministry the place that you're trying to get people is to understand the weight of sin and the reality of God's design for marriage and sexuality and so you're taking people on that path and if the gateway for them getting there is for them just learning to get rid of their shame in these practical ways I'm okay with that you know because again it's about I look at what is your theology and what is your heart and I don't see you're when I look at the collective whole of your heart and what you're saying and who you are you're not trying to affirm sin so I think it's one of those things where it's like everything just requires a little bit of nuance and a little bit of sensitivity to you know and and if it were me I probably wouldn't have worded the post that you did if I'm honest I probably would not have worded it that way but I can respect that you did what you did because I know your heart and I get your heart now you know so if that makes sense it's like we can agree to a disagree on that slight little thing there but I have so much respect for your heart and what you're trying to do and I think you're doing it beautifully well thanks for giving me an opportunity to explain it and yeah I mean I you know I don't know how much time people think I spend running some of these captions for these posts not enough time but but you know there's many things that I have written particularly in a platform like social media that I look back what is some stuff I wrote six months ago and I said oh I would totally rewrite that differently now. Oh I've been blasted I've been blasted by some of my fellow people in the industry where it's like dude why did you write that that way that was so unclear and so in helpful and it's like in my mind I thought I was really clear but I guess you know you write that thing you're like this is so good this is so clear and then you hit sand and then you get five people in your DMs were like bro what do you do but that's not what that post wasn't even as severe as that I'm just trying to say man I appreciate you yeah that's all I'm doing I think you're a great job well thank you I'm encouraged by your heart and who you are yeah thank you and I would say if people are you know curious I would say first you know connect with some of the longer form stuff that's been published in in really credible places like Christianity today in Mirror Orthodoxy and Fat and Magazine and Christ and Pop culture read the stuff that I've had published there you know first that's the stuff that you know editors had helped make sure that I'm actually communicating well so yeah well yeah I'll grab some of that stuff and I'll put it in the links in the show notes because I think you've got so much good stuff to offer so much good stuff to say and I think that you know we've been talking for a while in this episode I think we need to do a follow-up episode that's cool with you where we can dive into now that we've established you know some of the theologies now that we've wrestled through some of the pushback let's jump into the the methodology because what I'm primarily concerned with is how can we as the church make a better future in this area how can we forge a world where same sex attracted Christians gay Christians whatever you want to call it those who are committed to the historic Christian sex ethic and the way of Jesus how can we create a space that is more helpful for them and encouraging for them and where they can thrive as Christ followers like that's what I'm so interested in and so I think you'd be a great guy to talk about like what does it look like for us as the church to forge that future would you be would you be interested? Yeah that'd be great I'd love to love to keep Chapman that way. Awesome man what we'll do it again soon Peter thanks so much for being on the show man seriously this has been an epic conversation I'm blessed I hope those you guys listening are blessed and is there any final encouragement you'd want to leave our audience before you leave? Just in culture to keep leaning in to these conversations I think God really does have good news and good gifts for people who experience persisting same sex attractions and I don't think maybe bringing this full circle I don't think that those of us who are gay are doomed to some less full life I think Jesus has just as full of a life to offer us and I think our churches can be a big part of the helping God offer that fullness to those people in our churches and outside of our churches so yeah looking forward to our next conversation to talk about how exactly our churches can do that.
