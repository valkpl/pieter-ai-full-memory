 Hello friends, I'm JP and I'm Drew and you're listening to the Broken But Beautiful podcast where we talk about why church is still worth it. Good to see you Drew. JP, glad to be back with you as always. The sun is shining through the windows. We've got the tea going another day for another conversation. Yeah, I'm very excited about today's conversation. I think it's going to be unique and I think there are probably a certain set of years that need to hear this episode. We prayed before we started recording that God would bring this episode to do what needs to hear it. So I think it's a really unique episode. I'm excited about it. I know it's something I need to hear and it's something I've found a lot about in my years as ministry. We're going to talk about funding family in church as a single Christian. I look back on my years in ministry and as Christians, we get so excited about marriage and we get so excited about families and kids that a lot of times we structure our churches all around. Mary, people with kids. Even the way we build our buildings with this is the adult married center and this is the kids center and teens center and various things like that. Yeah, I think about the church that I work at currently. If you go down to the basement where some of the old classrooms are still on the door, there's a sign that's been screwed into the door that says singles one singles two, you know, talking about the different classes and age groups that would would meet. And as I think about it, I'm grateful that my church focused on groups of people that were single, groups of people that were married, people that were young adults, people that were older, focusing on different people in different stages of life. I'm grateful that our church has a history of that and we've seen that play out, hopefully for our church. But it's just it's an interesting dynamic because, you know, we have emphasis in the scriptures on, you know, healthy marriages and having kids, but then Christians sometimes take it to a standpoint where it's almost like we're idolizing marriage and idolizing family. And I know from the time when I was single, the years when I was single, but also my friends that are single, sometimes we can stigmatize, sell a bit singleness in the church. It's kind of a lesser than discipleship or kind of like this. Well, someday you'll grow up and get married. Even though Jesus was single and never got married. And outside of Jesus, the most significant person of the first century church, the Apostle Paul was single and never got married. So how can churches do a better job of being family for single believers? You know, just one quick story some years ago, we put in our church bolts in that we were going to have a family retreat and this woman came into me and said, she's single woman, a widow. And she came into me and said, cannot go on the retreat because I don't have a family. And I was like, of course, I'm a church family, right? But it was this idea that she felt just the way we phrased it, kind of shut out of something. Yeah, it's interesting that the way churches tend to structure themselves. You know, I talked about how I'm grateful that our church focused on different people and their different areas and stages of life that they're in. But churches sometimes, if they're not careful, they can tend to build their structure and build their classes and build all the things that go on on any given Sunday morning or Wednesday or whenever your church meets, they can tend to build those things around marriages and families. And whether they realize or not, they're saying that, you know, this is the ideal that we hold for people that you would be married, that you would have children for some people. That's a really beautiful thing. And I'll be able to part of the story and part of their life. But sometimes there are people who are single, maybe they want family, or maybe they want a spouse or a partner, and maybe they want kids, but they just get further on down the road in life and they just haven't found someone. Or like who we're going to talk to today, Peter Volk, who J.P. interviewed, they have a call to singleness and sell to see that they feel like God has instilled in their life. Yeah, so I want to do better on this issue and I want to, I'd love to see a context where churches can think more deeply about being family to single folks. So anyway, I want to introduce us to a friend of mine who's probably made me think about this more than anyone else the last decade. His name is Peter Volk and he has a very unique story. So Peter is a gay Christian man who lives according to the historical traditional sex ethic. So in short, he's single and he's celibate. Now this episode is not about sexual ethics. Like there's a lot of different tangents we could get to in this episode. We want to try to stay focused. We believe sexual ethics is an important conversation. It's definitely one that is shaped Peter's story, but you know, maybe we'll punt that to a future episode or something. His Peter will share. He leads a ministry called a quip, which helps churches have helped the biblical conversations about sexual ethics and he works as a counselor. But today, as we listen to his story, I just want to all consider how someone in his unique situation, how are they supposed to find family and how tragic it is that sometimes it's the church where they feel most lonely and it pains me. Yeah, like we have these people in churches who want the best for people who are single and the church. But I wonder how often we actually listen to these people who are single. Yeah, do we listen to their stories and why does sing on us so often in church cultures? And I'm a love church. I'm a part of a church, but why is it in church cultures? Sing on us, makes this nervous. Yeah, okay. Anyway, there's a lot going on in this story, but I pray that we'll listen to what Peter has to share. Yeah, let's get into it. Peter, thanks for joining us. Yeah, thanks for having me. Well, I'm thrilled for this opportunity. I found that every time I hang out with you or get you in front of my church or my students, you have a way of phrasing things in a way that challenges every single person in the room. And so I'm confident this will be that same type of experience. Why don't we start off by you just telling us about your background, where you grew up, what things were like for you? Spiritsally, from a church perspective. Yeah, so I grew up in northeast Tennessee, rural, conservative Christian town and family. So a pretty typical experience in all of those ways. Everyone did church things. We got church three times a week. You know, was taught that the Bible is how we know Jesus and what the Bible says is the self-evident and everyone agrees on what it says. And I think a big part of my story of faith was, I mean, I'm accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior at a Baptist reformed summer camp. I think summer after fourth grade. But in many ways, kind of my appreciation for how I was broken and how the world was broken and why I needed a Savior. I didn't really understand it fully until in middle school, I realized I was gay. I realized I was attracted to other guys in the ways that other guys were attracted to other girls. But I also kind of had been heard at least for simply explanation of kind of God, God of the against homosexuality, God hates gay people in my church. So I did not think that God would bless kind of me seeking out a relationship with the dude. And so I had this sense that kind of I was off in some way, that something was wrong, also found the response from from others in the church to be painful. So I had this sense that like, okay, this is why we need Jesus. If you've like a lot of people are often a lot of ways and and this is the way in particular that I'm that is made clear to me that that I need Jesus. Yeah, so I think a lot of my story since then, a lot of my faith journey has revolved around me making sense of my sexuality and how God calling me to to faithfully steward my sexuality and honor him and obey him and what is his best for me? What is what is the best things that God wants to offer me? And how is that still difficult and inconvenient in light of the fact that I live in a broken world that doesn't always make faithfulness to convenience? Yeah, so that's a bit about kind of where I grew up, beginnings of my faith journey and some of the things that have been most impactful. So it sounds like you were dealing with a lot from an early age and experiences that were out I would assume were very self-isolating. Yeah, I mean, I was terrified for people to find out that I was gay because I thought I would get hurt rejected. I mean, the possibility of being sent away to some pray the gay away camp was very real and so I had to make sense of this all by myself. But it wasn't just like, oh, this one small area of my life, I had to be very fry that but then everywhere else I was able to be transparent and vulnerable. You know, I was afraid that if I let anyone anyone in at any depth, you know, I might accidentally let some of this gay stuff slip out. And so I think I became kind of emotionally and spiritually and psychologically isolated from my parents and my friends and most always in middle school all to make sure that this secret that may lead to people rejecting and hurting me stays a secret. Oh, yeah, it was not great. But unfortunately, it's a pretty typical experience of being in the closet. I mean, for I'm a licensed professional counselor among a variety of things that kind of I do professionally these days and I particularly meet with clients navigating faith and sexuality and kind of very common symptoms of the closet are exited, are loneliness, anxiety, depression, suicidality, loss of faith, different kind of levels of addiction to try to cope with the pain. So you asked some of those things were true for me. So specifically in your own life, you've reached just from our conversations in the past, you reached the conclusion that you were called personally to celibacy. And how long ago did you come to that conclusion? Yeah, so long story short, I did date some a couple of women in college and was very transparent with them about my sexuality and I said, hey, I think you're cool and you know I'm gay but like you want to go on a date and just like see what happens and like for a couple of women that led to me actually developing a specific kind of desire for for them. And so I knew that Christian marriage could work for me. It's that what got had for me. But I also had read what the scriptures had to say about this singleness for the Lord, about the singleness of Jesus and Paul. And so after college, both of those things like options for me, possibilities for me and I can't explain it any other way than maybe just to say that the Holy Spirit may clear to me, but I wasn't supposed to just go choose and take what I wanted. Then I was supposed to ask God if he had a preference which he wanted to give me. And so I kind of entered into kind of an unintentional accidental discernment process and about three or four years ago, it became clear to me that I think the God was calling me to the to the singleness of Jesus and Paul to a to a lifetime vocation of absent and singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention. I would love for you to speak to the conversation we've had in the past about as you decide, I feel like the Lord's leading me to singleness. How does the church handle people who talk the way you talk and have the perspective the way you have? Has the church been helpful? Harmful or this is our to be singal and to live vocational singleness? How is that going? Yeah, the it's been difficult. And the Christians have a long history in the church of its kind of relationship with celibacy and singleness for the Lord. You know there were some really healthy ways for particularly in the early church that lots of Christians were making commitments to life-time singleness for the sake of kingdom work and involves in their local churches and living in communities with other single people and it was really beautiful for the gospel. And then some funky things started happening, you know, three or four or five hundred years into the church, we, you know, going all way up to kind of the abuses of celibacy in the Catholic church that are part of the origins of the Protestant Reformation. You know, but then the Protestant Reformation, you know, it seemed like how the Luther kind of throughout the baby with the bathwater and instead of kind of returning to what scripture had to say about celibacy, they just ignored the passage of the scripture about singleness for the Lord and taught that. That marriage is for the vast majority of Christians that celibacy is the extraordinary thing for people who are missionaries and God will sustain them spiritually, but we don't need to talk about celibacy in our churches and we certainly don't need to support celibacy in our churches, we don't need to encourage anyone to discern celibacy in our churches. So, yeah, as I've been along this journey personally, at best, I get curious looks and confusion from other Christians. At worst, I get people telling me that I'm not doing my Christian duty to get married to a woman and have babies for Jesus. I want to acknowledge that was heavy. Listen to him talk about that in the pain that he experienced in isolation is he was wrestling with these things and whether it's this specific type of experience or other types of things, I think we should hurt. What we hear stories like this about people suffering in silence about various things that they feel like they feel like they can't be open about what's really going on in their lives and I think I think kind of a foundational thing for our church communities is we need to be a place where people can be transparent and authentic about what's going on and so for those that are listening to this and maybe have a experience similar to Peter or maybe it's different but also kind of the suffering and silence type of thing. We acknowledge the pain you went through and pray that our communities can be better about given people space to listen to one another. Yeah, I love that how Peter was talking about how he wanted to be a faithful steward of his and his case sexuality. It might not be sexuality for everybody but you know asking the question of how can I be a faithful steward of my in this case singleness is what we're talking about but that's a really a really heavy question to ask how can I honor an obey God and if you're doing that in community that's a heavy question but if you're doing that alone in isolation that's might be an even heavier question is how can I honor an obey God am I doing this by myself do I have community to do this with and JP and I would advocate that our church should be placed is where we can ask those kinds of questions and we want single people to know that the church is a place where you can do that you can ask those questions about honoring an obeying God in your stage of life because we don't see you as just waiting until you what I'll quote graduate to a next level and then we can talk about different ways to honor an obey God or we can congratulate you for honoring an obeying God in marriage or whatever but in in Christian community we want to walk through those things with you. Few people in my life talk as enthusiastically about vocational singleness is Peter. Yeah and it's inspiring to me because he talks about what the Bible says about this and why we're not talking about what the Bible says about this and so some of us may be thinking we're in the Bible does it talk about this idea of vocational singleness and not to get into a lone Bible study although I would encourage folks to seek it out. Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 does talk about how he wishes more people to like him as a single person and he connects that with ministry he connects that to kingdom living kingdom opportunity. Jesus in Matthew 19 when asked about divorce and he talks about marriage he does talk about people who have have made themselves unix for the kingdom of God. A lot of interpretation that goes into that and yet there has been this this long history of seeing people that are called to sing on us for the good of the kingdom and we've lost that discernment and I'd love to see that come back on some level instead of Peter just automatically experiencing this default suspicion that he's not out there getting married to have a baby's for Jesus type of thing. I love the look of a question that Peter asked he said I asked God what he wanted from me and the answer that he got was singleness but not just singleness for the sake of singleness but it's singleness so that he could do kingdom work with undivided attention. Yeah maybe to walk away from a singleness conversation for a half a second but we should be asking those questions of what is distracting us what is pulling our attention away from serving God and doing kingdom work work for the reconciliation of all things for Peter it just happened to be sexual ethic and and singleness and all of that could benefit his ministry. I think it's a really good question for us to ask asking God what he wants from us so that we can do kingdom work with undivided attention. I love that and to see that in Christian history there has been a place for the person that was single and I think our churches have been concerned about the quote unquote breakdown of the family and once again I think marriage is awesome I think having kids is important and it's a calling but we've been so concerned about the quote unquote threats to that that we've circled the wagons in a way that I think has made our churches less than hospital at times for single folks and that's not just people in Peter situation who are called to singleness other people don't feel called to it they're looking for someone to marry but maybe many years goes by and they haven't found someone this would include people that are divorced people that have never gotten married elderly widows people in their 20s and 30s people get married later than they used to get married and it's it's off putting if we have an obsession with fixing people up no matter their age does it does it run the risk of saying you're not complete in and of yourself so we need you to do this so that you can be a part of things here yeah it's important to look at what our churches communicate and regard to that so JP and Peter continue to talk about that and that's what we're going to hear in the next section about what can the church do to honor and celebrate singleness I mean I know just in my life experience when when my dad was a single dad when I was 9 10 11 years old it was really obvious to me that he didn't really seem to fit in our church structure anymore that our church structure even the way that we did classes at church the way we did ministries at church it was for kids teenagers and married couples and I think probably most people listening if had some time of experience where they were single or they had a friend that was single and said oh man we're just kind of on the fringe here we don't really fit but I know you've had some ideas on how churches can really wrap their arms around people both people that might be single temporarily you know while they're dating and haven't found a spouse or those that are that are called a more of a lifelong cell to see that you've been talking about here how can churches do better what are some of the things you've seen? Yeah so kind of five things come to mind I think number one I mean we've got to teach what the Bible has to say about all these things right and I think there's plenty of places in scripture that that talk about singleness but I think we can also talk about kind of spiritual parents in our lives who weren't maybe who weren't our biological parents but you you know had an influence on our lives so all these things can come up in church so we've got to teach about it because what we teach about signals to our kids what's valuable? Second I think we've got to find ways to kind of kind of honor and value and and celebrate singleness I think it's important to see it kind of modeled so for example I think we we need we need that leaders in our churches who are single and syllabus one because we've got to we've got to that help signal to kids in our churches that this is a good option for them if they're called to it also because I think so that people have a lot of time energy available to serve the church so there's a there's a benefit there and I think we've got to find some ways to kind of mark milestones in the lives of celibate people and celebrate those you know for some people they may want to make kind of a public commitment to singleness for the Lord and have a public kind of ceremony and the celebration connected to that and then the anniversary of that commitment can be something that could be celebrated every year so I think that's important for maybe a church to invite single to consider doing that and to celebrate that with them. I think we've got to invite everyone every Christian young adult in our church to discern open handedly with Jesus whether God is calling them to vocational singleness or Christian marriage I think that will lead to more people living out vocational singleness and therefore supporting vocational single more because there's more of us doing it and and then I think a key thing is we've got to help vocational single find family in the body of Christ and I think in part that looks like just us doing kind of large group fellowship events at our church that looks like us having small groups that aren't just based on everyone in the same kind of stage of life but it's kind of a mix of old and young and married and not and all that kind of stuff and I think it's you know maybe married people being intentional about inviting single people to stuff in their home and not assuming that single people don't want to be around kids or don't want to be around couples for example but I think what's most important is our church has got to help the single people find some experience of kind of lived in long-term family and there's three ways to do that I mean one is people can stay connected to their their biological family they can continue to live with parent or with brothers or sisters or answer uncles and kind of commit to living in their house and helping them raise any kids they might have and and that be their kind of source of family in the body of Christ churches can connect single people with kind of unrelated nuclear families in their church and they can even move into their their house and help them raise their kids you know for example I'm the godfather for a kid at our church that the church I go to and an option on the table for me has been to move in with their family and help raise my godson and and help raise their other kids and be a part of kind of that like larger family units and then another way this kind of so little people can find family is through some form of intentional Christian community was that be a community of single people of the same sex a co-ed mix of single people or a mix of single people and married people in a larger experience of intentional Christian community but all those are our options and I think you know churches gosh there's so many resources that that the church provides Christian marriage with how to do Christian marriage well so many supports structures I mean prepare and enrich you know pre-marriage counseling things and marriage retreat and we and we do marriage ceremonies we do all these things that nurture marriages and ought to marriages a beautiful thing that got us created we need as many structures and programming pieces and supportive elements to make vocational single lives happen well love how you talk about this and I do as you as you mentioned this I think of the times I saw this work well you know where families went up to someone and said hey you don't need to sit by yourself you're always welcome to sit with us and they kind of had a puberty at church right like they always the single individual always sat with this other family or this other couple or people doing holidays together or you're kind of as you say godfather or kind of honorary family remember that you're kind of always the plus one at birthday parties and kind of stuff like that yeah it's a really beautiful thing yeah I mean just yesterday I got called into some emergency babysitting for my godson so he is his dad as a as a cop and he gets kind of called into to testify and often without much notice and so mom was working and dad was a working and they didn't have babysitter plans and so I went over there and I'm taking care of my godson his I mean his baby but it was it was a delight and like I'm a part of that family I mean there's a trust that they have with me with their kids and there's a vulnerability that I have with my godson parents that is really special and beautiful and I think part of that is you know I don't think celibacy is a call to not be involved in lives of kids I think it's still I think it's a call to labor alongside married friends and help them raise their kids it just means that I can kind of support multiple families at one time and they need help raising kids is a a tough job or at least I observe from the outside you're right it is a tough job I love what you're saying here and I think about you know an art church the best Bible teacher we have at art church is a single lady and she is so good with our kids and our teenagers I think of so many people who've been growing up that we're single but they were there to help my family help my parents and singled images that kind of helped me as you say kind of with with children and just kind of other types of things and it all sounds so biblical I mean this is the picture we have in scripture about we're supposed to be family we're supposed to be each other's family yeah yeah and yeah and it's both to the benefit of the the married people and to the to the fellow the people jippies we're sitting here listening to this interview and recording this podcast I'm thinking to the different churches I've been a part of over the years the single people who are a part of those communities and they had so much to offer yeah they had so much to contribute they were the people who would pick up things at the drop of a hat and be there to support certain ministries or participate in certain things simply because they had the time and energy to do it at one point Peter said that maybe we need to have more leaders in the church who are single and sell it because they have more time and energy to participate in certain things I think that not I think that I know that our churches would not run without those single people who really help out and are willing to give a lot of their time and energy and finances to the church I think about our children's ministry I have one woman that comes to mind who is an incredible Bible teacher and if for some reason we told her that she couldn't participate in our children's ministry because she wasn't married our children would be at a loss yeah for sure and other ministries that are church would be at a loss but weren't for people who were single so I I love that Peter is really focusing on how not only can single people find a family in church but they are a part of the family in church they they are just as crucial to the picture as people who are married and having kids and I was convicted when he talked about do we give more resources to help people do marriage well to help people do single as well and I know the answer it's a lot more resources on how to do marriage well and so these single folks that are they're doing so much at our churches oftentimes they're doing it without us giving them a lot of support to do it well that was convecting also reminded me of how many stories I've seen you know how church you often have like your Pew or your chair you always say like people are such creatures of habit I've seen this happen more than once where a family will say to a single person would you like to sit with us and not just this week but like every week it'll be a thing like we'll be we'll be of our event and it's it's need to see that happen and to see that long term just it's no fun going to church and send by yourself and I and I get that I get that I remember the years I was single I would always try to find somebody so it was because I didn't like send by myself I don't know if I should tell this story well then well then you definitely should okay yeah let's do it there is a a single widowed woman who has joined our church recently and I connected her with another woman in our community who was able to drive her to church every week oh great and they sit together in the Pew every week and I heard a story this past week about how someone was mistaken that they were actually sisters and that they lived together like no she just picks her up and she brings her to church every week and it's they've formed a really beautiful friendship and I think that that's a great example of what can happen in our churches that people who need community can find that in our churches I love that and lastly I can't think and if we made our churches a place where we encourage singleness for the Lord and we saw that as a very viable option how many people would that prevent from rushing into marriage I mean drew how many of our friends have we seen rushing to marriage because they felt like they were incomplete and obviously they get some of that message from our culture at large but I think sometimes that message comes from the church though you are incomplete if you're not married and it would I think it would prevent some of that because I think there's a lot to chew on and what Pewter says and then what he's worries about to take it is even more interesting yeah I love what he's about to say about finding deep intentional community I think we're all seeking it out in the way that Peter is doing it with his Nashville family of brothers it's really unique so don't turn off the podcast make you check out the last bit here. I'm grateful for your your witness and the conversation on this did you want to briefly talk about the the Nashville family of brothers and kind of what you're doing with that as a close. Yeah sure so you know the particular way that I'm finding family is I'm Anglican which for those of you all who aren't familiar with kind of lots of denominational stuff it's some people joke it it's Catholic minus the Pope but it's you know kind of more formal and traditional and it's it's the third largest Christians nomination worldwide and kind of one of the oldest Christian traditions alongside Eastern North not as old as Eastern North of the Oxford or the Catholic Church but it's a kind of third and third in line there as well in that in that way so so anyway I was meeting with kind of the past of my church and and I was sharing with him hey I think I'm called to this vocational single this for the sake of the kingdom my only concern is how am I gonna find family how am I gonna find human family and he turned to me and he said and I'm really thankful for his honesty he said Peter I don't know if you're going to find the kind of family human family that you need at this church anytime soon for any church in Nashville wow and he was able to answer this honestly because he while he is is married and has kids he kind of visited some monastery frequently and has some friends who are celibate long-term and so he kind of knows what level of family they need to be healthy but then he said but Peter monasticism has been the most common way that celibate people have found family in the church monasticism has been the greatest source of theology in the church monasticism has been the greatest source of evangelism in the church monasticism has been the greatest source of social justice in the church so I think you should consider trying to start some kind of modern contemporary monastery and find family there and then from that monastery teach our church how to do family in the body of Christ better so that was like four years ago and since then backwards now I live in a house with four other guys who are all committed to to singleness for the sake of the kingdom and and we call ourselves the Nashville family of brother we do we make kind of long-term commitment to our community to to vocational singleness to finding family with each other to kind of living according to a common rule of life and just do reading our finances modestly and generously and to leverage our availability and singleness for the sake of the kingdom we do kind of morning prayer together every morning we do a certain number of kind of meals together at the home and we do kind of vacation is on holidays together and alternate those with our biological families but we all have kind of like normal jobs outside of the monastery but we do feel that I got as particularly calling us to to leverage our nine to five jobs for the sake of the kingdom you know we don't have kids and we have a lot of shared expenses so we could afford to get paid left to do jobs that maybe are bringing forth the kingdom more quickly and we're also still a part of our local churches you know we are all committed to different local churches to the communities and missions of those local churches so you know our our our home is not our church we're still a part of local churches and and we're also not like cloistered from our community in any way we live in the middle of the city we're still connected to to families like my uh like my godson family and and have lots of friends and family outside of the national family brothers that we've been lots of time with but we've got a family right we know who we're we're we're gonna come home to after work we know who's gonna pick us up from the airport we know who was available when we're having a tough day you know eventually some of us are gonna make lifetime commitment to this community we know who's gonna be holding our hand when we die that's what family is and and that's what we're finding here well I I love Erie and you talk about this I think it's such such an amazing thing and I love what your minister told you I mean it's a historic thing and we look at church history we see how God has used communities like this uh in the past it's so great to see this type of thing being recaptured yeah it's it's definitely odd I mean it's um the way we're doing the national family brothers isn't the only way to do it but we are trying to kind of rediscover a way to do kind of celibacy in community that that is kind of rich and kind of borrows from the best things the monasteries have done historically what are the essential ingredients that we just we can't compromise on because centuries of celibates doing life together has proven has demonstrated what the best formula is for doing family as much as celibates but also on the things that that aren't essential how can we kind of make it fit the 21st century and make sure we are a resource to our local churches and to our local community because you know that's ultimately I think what God I think God has called Mary people to this important and very difficult kingdom work of raising kids and then I think God has called celibate people to use their availability from not doing that kingdom work to doing a bunch of other kingdom work that and I gosh we do not need any reminders after this past year with political polarization and racial injustice and the effects of the widespread effects of COVID let me to need any reminders any more reminders that our world is broken and desperately means some radical group of five to 10% of Christians accepting a call to to abstinence the illness for the sake of the kingdom and using all the energy they could be using for the important kingdom work to raise kids to instead address all of this brokenness in our society with undivided attention I think the need is great I think the need is obvious and and I hope that there are more believers in the coming generations that will say yes to Jesus' invitation Jesus' invitation and in Matthew 19 some of you are called to live like unique for the sake of the kingdom those of you that kind accepted should well that's a good word Peter and I appreciate it I'm thankful for this fresh expression that you're a part of in the local church I think Peter casts a vision for community in a way that probably exceeds what a lot of us have ever imagined I would encourage this all to just sit with this a bit and think about it and kind of just doing audit of our relationships and how we're finding family and the people we know how they're finding family and how can we really embrace what Jesus says in the Gospels where he says his family is everyone who does the will the father and how can we see church is family so when every time I spend time with Peter I feel I feel challenged and I feel encouraged so I'm thankful for his voice his witness in his ministry yeah and I'm grateful for the words from his minister who said to him that from your way of living teach our church how to do family in the body of Christ better I hear that and I go single people in our church can teach us how to do life in the body better we have so much to learn from single people I've been blessed by single people in our church JPNOU have been blessed by those people whether called to singleness or celibacy or whether you're just in the season of life where you haven't found a partner yet or maybe you're still discerning what that means you have something to contribute to your church family and if you're searching for that and maybe you have been looking for something like that outside of a church family we would encourage you to maybe consider looking in a church family for that we pray that you would find people there to love you and support you as you walk through life because we all walk through life and it's better when we do it together it sounds great drew on joy let's do it again sometime all how about the next episode if anyone's got some follow-up questions because I know we opened up like 15 different hands of warm
