 Hey, welcome to the Kingdoms podcast. My name is Luke and I host this with my buddy Matt Ma. And our goal is to empower you to discover how your faith impacts culture for God's kingdom. To do that, we're sitting down with different men and women from all kinds of disciplines, to uncover how they, through their ambitions and vocational skillset, make a difference in the lives of those around them. And so if this is helpful to you, we'd love it if you could like it, share it, and subscribe. In the meantime, enjoy today's episode. Well, hey friends, thanks so much for jumping back in with us on this conversation. On the King's podcast, I'm here with my co-host Matt Ma, but also really grateful to be with our guest contributor today, Peter Valk. Peter, thank you so much for making the time to join us. Yeah, thanks for having me. Glad to be here. 100% man, well, Peter, we've had the chance to get to know each other a little bit, just corresponding emails and different things. You actually parachuted in for one of our youth meetings over Zoom earlier this month, and just somebody who, the more I've connected with, the more I've been able to really appreciate your story and really value God's calling on your life. And I want our listeners to have the chance to get a snapshot of that, to be able to see like who is Peter, what has God done in his story? What's God called him to now? So as we look at diving into some significant topics in a few moments, could you just start us by giving a snapshot of your story, who you are, and what your vocational work is in right now? Yeah, so long story short, I grew up in a Christian home in rural East Tennessee, in the United States, and so I heard growing up that, well, not much about gay people, other than God is against homosexuality. So when I was in middle school and I started to realize that I was attracted to other guys of the same sex that I was gay, my automatic reaction was was shame. I must have done something wrong, I must have, I'm off, and it must be my fault. And fear that other people would hear my story would find me out, and that I would get hurt because of that. From then, for the next 10 years, 13 years, I spent so many hours in prayer, asking that God would heal me that he would remove my same sex attraction. I was in counseling with the therapist who thought he could change my sexual orientation over that decade. I went to a peer-to-earthurched ministry, conferences, and kind of experiential weekend. And through all of that, I was pleading with God, God, please, if it's your will, would you remove my same sex attraction, would you make me straight? And God didn't, it wasn't his will. And actually, signs of anxiety about sexual orientation change, efforts shows that 96% of people who seek out sexual orientation change efforts experience, no change in their, in their same sex attraction. But people who experience seek out sexual orientation change, efforts do experience a 92% increase in suicidality. And so yeah, that was a painful season for me. And some reason why it was so painful, is that I felt very alone, right? Because I was afraid to share my story. And because I felt stuck in the middle between all of the Christians I knew I presumed that they were straight. And what I heard the community around me, how I heard the community around me, talk about gay people, was a pretty ugly kind of homophobic characterization of gay people. So I didn't think I belonged among them either. So I just felt like I was all alone. Thankfully, I eventually started sharing my story. And there were mixed reactions when I shared with my parents in high school, they didn't know how to help me anymore that I didn't have to help myself, but at least I was alone in my story anymore. For the end of college, I actually was a part of this campus ministry for four years. I led Bible studies, I led recruitment efforts, I deciphered other people in the campus ministry. I represented the ministry to the university. I was given every reason to believe that when I graduated, if I wanted to come on staff with this campus ministry, I could. And then with kind of out explanation or too much explanation, certainly without warning, I was told for the end of my senior year that I shouldn't apply to go on staff with that. The campus ministry at that university or that campus ministry at any university. And the only explanation was given was that they didn't know what to do with my sexuality, with my same sex attraction. But the things I most people have responded to my story in kind of in beautiful ways, in really encouraging ways, in particular, I shared earlier in college with a Christian fraternity that I was a part of. I shared my story because there was a guy who had left the fraternity because he was in a long-term romantic relationship with another guy and it was a few kind of accountability from the Christian fraternity around that. We agreed to enjoying this fraternity as we wouldn't be in those kinds of relationships. But some of the guys in the fraternity weren't responding very well to this kind of public, you know, leaving of the fraternity by this one gay brother. So I wanted to share my story so that guys in the fraternity who weren't gay would know how to love people like me better and that guys in the fraternity who were gay and Christian and committed to a traditional sexual ethic would meet like me would know, but they're not alone. So I fearfully shared my story and then much to my delight instead of like after sharing my story, guy after guy in the fraternity lined up to give me a hug and got out there phone and they were like, hey, when can we get coffee, when can we get out of the yellow and I wanted to hear more about your story. And so those fraternity love me well, but one of the things that came out of me sharing my story with that community was a number of guys over the next six months shared with me that they were gay and Christian and committed to a traditional sexual ethic. And we all realized together, two things were true of us. All of us were afraid that if we followed God's wisdom, we would be alone. And the second thing was that none of us all like me had parents or pastors who knew what to do with us, who knew how to care for us, how to help us. In many ways, that was the inspiration for all of the work that I do today. Fast forward to now. I, or fast forward to seven years ago, I helped start a ministry that equips parents and passions that provide parents and pastors with the understanding and skills to better love and serve gay people according to a traditional sexual ethic. And then three years ago, I helped found an intentional Christian community for men called to singleness for the Lord, regardless of sexual orientation, where they can find lived in lifelong families. So yeah, maybe I'll share a couple of bits of like the resume section of my story briefly and then we'll kind of get into whatever's next. But yeah, other kind of details. I went to Vanderbilt University for undergraduate went to a lipscom university to get my master's in clinical mental health counseling. And then I also did a fellowship program at Gordon Conwell, theological Seminary. One day a week on a licensed professional counselor and I meet with gay people trying to make sense of faith and sexuality. And the rest of the week my full-time job is I read a ministry called a quip. That ministry that I said we started seven years ago, where a team of missionary consultants who helped churches become places where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic. And it probably would be good to insert here what I mean, when I say a traditional sexual ethic, what I mean. What I think a traditional sexual ethic is a biblical sexual ethic or the dox sexual ethic. Is that God best for every Christian is either a lifetime commitment to abstinent singleness for the sake of doing senior work with undivided attention. Or a lifetime commitment to marriage between a Christian man and a Christian woman with an openness to the importance of reading and work of raising children. So that's what I think a traditional sexual ethic is. What I believe for myself, that's what we teach as a ministry I run. And yeah, and then I mentioned that kind of maybe third project I'm really involved in, which is an intentional Christian community called the Nashville family of brothers. I would get paid to do that work, but you know, I'm committed to that lifetime abstinent singleness for the sake of the kingdom. And I still need human family. And so in many ways starting this Nashville family of brothers is the way that I can find the family I need. You know, we are we're like a monastery in the sense that we have a common kind of rule of life. We make commitments to sell the sea. We eventually make lifetime commitments to this community. We do kind of prayer together every morning. We do confession together regularly. We do vacations and some holidays together and whatnot. The goings are different is, you know, we're still a part of our local church. Our monastery is not our church. Yeah. And we're so committed to the community and the teaching of our local church. Another way we're different is that we have jobs outside of our community, outside of the monastery. Now we all feel what they're called because we're called to this vocational singleness. We think we're called a particularly leverage our nine to five jobs for the sake of the kingdom. But our jobs are not in our monastery. And we're not cloistered in any way. We're really involved in our communities and in families and our churches and friends outside of the National Family. So yeah, that's a bit about me, my story, particularly around faith and sexuality. You know, what I'm up to these days and then what I care about. Yeah. That's what he's. I was just telling Luth the other day like I would love to go and live in a Russian monastery. We won't we won't get too deep into that. You had mentioned that like part part of your your heartbeat right now for ministry. Up to the past seven years is like a quipping church is to love people better. And maybe you can go into a little bit more of. I'm sure that there are moments that you felt loved as a kid in your church that you thought that you know, your church was able to love you well. Maybe you can talk about some of the decisions that you experience in your own experience of church growing up. Sure. Yeah, there's this kind of there's there's five common kind of gaps that the equipped these with the churches we work with. And and a lot of these I saw in my own life. And I think it's a helpful way to think about you know, first of all, we figured out what we got to do differently. We got to assess what have we been doing and how is that working. So, you know, the first thing that I think of common and I'm with you for me is that I grew up in a church that didn't really teach about God was in. For sexual stewardship for all people. It was it was a church that the kind of avoided with the Bible had to say about the voice and remarriage. I've ordered with the Bible had to say about the single most of Paul and Jesus and certainly didn't invite any straight people to consider the single most of Paul and Jesus. I've ordered with the Bible had to say about kind of child rearing being an openness to children being an important part of Christian and marriage. But my church was really serious that Christian marriages was renal man and a woman and God would never bless a gay marriage. And I think that like it's a imbalance that holding a high status for sexual stewardship for gay people, but then kind of seeing willing to compromise and a lot of things when it comes to sexual stewardship for straight people. That that made it really hard for me to believe that my church is really cared about honoring God with their bodies and more just thought gay people were growth and not worth. A accommodating not worth it, bending the rules a little bit for me. And then it easy for me to have kind of a victim mentality about toward the church and about my my story. So I think that's one thing that's common in that and that was true for me. A second thing that's kind of a common and it was true for me was my church never got into the details of kind of how. What does God think about LGBT topics LGBT questions that what it's God love and wisdom for gay people. You know, more particular than just God wouldn't bless a gay marriage. Okay great. So what you got in by being gay people to say yes to. Silent. And and that was painful for me because I didn't know if if I shared my story in my church. Whether what I would get because I never heard anyone talk about it other than again, God begins homosexuality. And that's me who's true for a lot of people today in churches is that maybe they go to a church that the doesn't talk about these topics much privately hold the traditional sexual effect. But then kind of sends out a general vibe of being really open and welcoming loving. And and gay people have what I call it what was called I didn't coin it many people call it this what's called a bait and switch experience where they invest in this church for years thinking it's one thing. And then realize it's another thing and feel pretty betray you know and when people feel betrayed by church. Truly easy for us also feel betrayed by Jesus and make it harder for us to follow Jesus or believe that Jesus loves us or is good. So I'm going to comment experience for me a third you know comment experience for experience for me that's common for others is. The first time my my parents were ever really talked about these topics and a compassionate way my church talked about these topics and a compassionate way with me. Was after I shared with them that I experienced things like attraction. By the time I first shared with a parent or a pastor that I was gay I had already spent five years making you sense of this alone all by myself. All by myself with the lives of the enemy all by myself with the messages sounding culture. And for me that led to to to anxiety to to depression to to unhealthy coping mechanisms to doubting whether God loves me and for a lot of other people it's led to adopting a progressive sexual ethic it's led to a loss of faith all together. And so yeah this this silence about these topics and this kind of waiting to talk to kids about this and so after they come out. A enabling kids to kind of kind of persist in the closet to struggle with this alone in the closet for five years on average that's pretty common that was true for me. You know number four you know a lot of churches pastors parents Christian leaders don't know how to provide good one on one pastoral care and then touring. To gay people that was my story too. When I was in high school and I shared with my youth pastor for the first time you know this is one of the if you guys do you faster than be like all the classes. We were at like a youth convention for our generation and we had like rented some large cabin with like a bunch of beds and bedrooms and like full table downstairs and all the things and a hot tub whatever. And then you know on the last night of programming after the conference we all gathered back in the cabin for our youth group and my youth pastor said something about like sharing our deepest darkest secrets and not being alone and shame and encouraging all of us to kind of find one of the many kind of leaders that night and share with them. You know whatever our thing was we were most ashamed of so you know I shared with you faster about this part of my story. And he was first just like violent. Then he shared a couple of Christian cliches and then he basically like sent me away. He had no idea how to care for me. No idea how the minister to me right and what does that tell me you know a sophomore junior in high school who's terrified of sharing this part of my story with anyone. It tells me don't share it again. You know if the youth pastor who's supposed to know how to do this certainly can't do this or you can't trust anybody else. So that was painful and unfortunately stuff like that is pretty common still. And then last but not least kind of fifth way that like churches often kind of struggle when it comes to doing this stuff in this ministry well and something that certainly been true for me is. Okay what I felt like the options were for me and light of a traditional sexual ethic were were were celibacy were vocational singleness or possibly navigating the complexity of of of marriage with someone of the opposite sex. While having persisting same sex attractions and while being really honest with that person I would be dating or marrying about my sexuality. And but I think one of the the challenges was you know my my my church growing up and even some of the churches have been in more recently. One place is where I could find kind of experience of family in the body of Christ with reasonable effort particularly as a person called the vocational single. Instead of what I experienced in college in particular and since then was a revolving door of roommate. A revolving door of church small groups that you know took a break every summer and usually dissolved. Nothing laughed as longer than a year that's not family right I mean anyone who's married would would admit that like if you had to get married. To a different person every year that would be exhausted you know if marriage is only last a year and you had to swap out spouses. Your heart couldn't take it you'd rather just be alone then get to duck in that revolving door. Well that's what it's like for a lot of single people. That's what it's and gay people gay Christians committed to the traditional sexual I think aren't the only people doing long term single left. But in a lot of our churches there are some of the only people who are kind of reckoning with a reality that is probably for a life. Most straight people are churches even if they're not dating and married now that it's probably a safe that to assume they can get married if they want to. So yeah that's that was that's been my experience in that the common experience in a lot of churches it's not places where gay people or any people committed to vocational single is committed to cell disease. Can can easily find a way to get family in the body of Christ you know to live with the same people for decades and be able to trust them with with with with their vulnerability for decades. So yeah that's been my story and unfortunately a lot of those things in my story are pretty common among gay people and churches. I appreciate that so much just even knowing that in a lot of ways like I've been culpable of a lot of those things. You know and and I know that maybe I've made some some growth even since I was young and growing up in a church context it was probably very simple but still I have a lot of growth to do in just how how to care for a community that is diverse. So thank you for that that was really helpful. Yeah and even just yeah like you said your own personal story reflects a lot of people's stories and in a few minutes we're going to dive into that question more about how. You know for people listening to this we're part of it various churches wherever can can do that better but I wanted to to dial in on something you had said because. Peter I really respect the way in which you're navigating not only your own story but. And so I think that's a very important thing to do with the story of somebody who identifies the same sex attracted a gay Christian in our current cultural climate because you've said you know I'm same sex attracted I'm a gay Christian but I support a traditional biblical ethic. That God's best is like you said vocational single this or marriage between a Christian man and a Christian woman in a lifelong covenant. We're navigating a cultural climate we're on one hand there are very militant fundamentalist religious groups including some churches who for anyone just to say I'm same sex attracted it's like. You're going to help like we know this like we've heard this and then on the flip side there is very progressive liberal groups and including churches that would say you have total sexual freedom. In Jesus and and you're navigating this almost a third way between those two extremes which I'm sure at times exposes you to. The eye of of one or both camps and so I want to ask you know why do you endorse this this third way this this I'm you know being honest about your story and yet being obedient to what you feel God's word is called you to. See you right it does kind of over me up the criticism from from those directions and that can be you know difficult it can be painful at times. Yeah, why am I still convinced of this. And so for me kind of like I've fundamentally got a building up the building blocks there I mean so when I believe I believe I've got exist. I don't know with certainty no one knows with certainty I mean I think there's something maybe are given an extra feeling of like the gift of faith from the Holy Spirit and it is. I think you're from the belief of God exists but that's not my story but I. But I choose to believe that that I got exist. I think if there's a God who's all powerful and all knowing then that God knows better than me what's best for me. I think that's true right I mean I if there's a way to know what this God knows about the world about what's good for me I want to know that and I want to follow that okay. And then third I believe that the God who exists is the God of the Bible is the God that the Christian the church the Christianity. You know speaks of and I think the church and the Bible is how we know who that God is. So if that if I think there's a God if I think that God is wise within me and if I think the church and the Bible is how we know who that God is and how he thinks about. What's good about this world and what's broken about this world and the wisest way for me to do it my sexuality to reach the most goodness in my life. You know it's it's it's. I'm pretty thoroughly convinced of it from those sources that how that God thinks about sexual stewardship for all people is a traditional biblical orthodox sexual essay. And I think this this topic came up when we were in a when you've grouped kind of yeah this is a pretty inconvenient teaching for me in some ways certainly. You know people who are not Christians would think this is a very inconvenient teaching for me. You know why am I convinced of it you know some people start with the the the clover passages these like six verses that many feel. It says directly the gay sex is a sin. I think there's a meaningful evidence to those verses but but honestly I don't think I think there's also reasonable way that people can cast out on on how convincing those thick verses are. And to be honest I don't think they're necessary to know what God's wisdom is for how all Christians in Stuart this actually. I think we really just need like. Matthew 19 first from the seven and Ephesians five to see that God's best for his Christians is this lifetime. Commitment to abstinence anyone else for the sake of doing senior workers undivided attention or this life time from between. Of mirrors between a Christian man and a Christian woman with an openness to the important key to work of raising children. That's got best for his people that's clearly what Matthew 19 first Corinthians seven Ephesians five teaches about so that's why I'm convinced by the whole of scripture. What God's vices for all people and none of them changed for me just because I happen to have the particular brokenness the particular temptation of same sex attraction that doesn't change what God best is. It's certainly inconvenient. But but but I still believe it will be more good for me. In line of mind during brokenness it's still more good for me to follow God wisdom. Than to not follow God wisdom. Now you've kind of and maybe it's terminology that we've used so far but maybe there's like some clarity that could be brought into it. Do you kind of feel like a distinction between same sex attraction and then would you like identify as a gay Christian so you've kind of so talked about this brokenness and I guess my my question is more or less like. Do you identify as a person who is gay or is this like an attraction you have that you recognize is sinful broken whatever you write. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, yeah, I kind of use a variety of language probably heard me. Yeah, a variety of language. You know, conversation. Yeah, so I do I do call myself. A gay Christian committed to a traditional sex. Well, I think I do refer to myself as gay. I do refer to myself as queer sometimes. When I use those words, I really only use them to recognize that I'm a person who who's sharing the same sex attraction and those are the words that our world uses to describe people like me. You know, from a philosophical perspective, I'm just kind of using those phenomena logic. Right. Yeah. You know, a phenomenology is, what is a thing based how do we describe a thing based on what we observe about it? What it appears to be. Yeah. And not what it is essentially or at its core in any way, just you know, how do we describe it based on its kind of external appearance. But like ontologically, I don't think I'm any difference of a person than either of you guys. I think what I am as I'm an imagebearer. That's what I was created to be and I'm not ontologically essentially anything different from my brothers and sisters in Christu, don't experience the same sex attraction. Yeah, I so, you know, to be clear, I don't think God in 10 for any people to experience the same sex attraction and 10 for people to be gay. I do think that it's the kind of a brokenness as a result of the fall. You know, I didn't do anything to bring about this in my life. It's not my fault. I haven't had to choose to experience things like the attraction, you know, the consensus of scientists, Christian and not, is that a mix of nature and nurture contribute to development of people's sexual orientation. But no one chooses who they're attracted to and we already, you know, mentioned earlier that there's also no formula for changing people attraction. So yeah, that's how I kind of, I see that in my own life. So, but I know people use those words gay and queer to mean different things. Sometimes they use those words to signal their theological convictions to signal the kinds of relationships that they're seeking out. But I don't think those words inherently mean that certainly kind of in broader culture in the US these days, if you ask us, a seven year old and eight year old or 12 year old, hey, what are these words gay, mean, lesbian, mean? Yeah. It just means boy, two-like boys, girls, two-like girls. And I found that like to be more effective in ministry to particularly kind of teenagers and young adults, I've got to use a language that they're using with their friends, that they're using in school, that the people in social media that they follow are using. Because, you know, convincing that it's commencing them that it's traditional sexual ethic is how God thinks about these topics. It's a difficult enough path, right? And encouraging them to embrace, stewarding those sexuality according to that traditional sexual ethic despite the fact that other churches may not be very helpful and helping them do that well. If I were to add an additional barrier that I refuse to use the words they use, I'm just making it harder for myself, for a task that's already pretty difficult to sell. No, thank you so much for that. That's really clarifying. And I think it really helps stress the reality that a biblical, sexual ethic actually requires even, like, heterosexual men to recognize that they are broken sexually. And that they ought to identify with that. And that's going to be something that I think a lot of men are going to deal with for the rest of their lives, right? So anyway, that was really helpful. And when we think of how followers of Jesus can interact with members of the LGBT-2 community, in what ways you talked before about just the revolving door of friendship, how can followers of Jesus promote and value real true, long-lasting friendship? Yeah. So I think first, we can kind of look to Scripture. And we can look at the friendships of David and Jonathan, of recent Naomi, of Jesus and John, of Paul and Timothy Paul and Barnabes, and we see these friendships where the scenes of the depth of almost like commitment and friendship, a depth of, of, of, of, of, of, kind of non-romantic intimacy, non-sexual intimacy and friendship. It's really beautiful. It's really life-giving. And I think it's going to look at those models for, for, for how do we do this kind of more meaningful committed friendship in the body of Christ? Something we'll call those spiritual friendships and the great book by guy named Wesley Hill called Spiritual Friendship on that topic, something that's a great read, regardless of sexual orientation. And I think we all need these like deeper committed friendships. I'm certainly if people who still call to to singleness for the Lord are going to need some of these deeper committed friendships, but I think it's true of Mary and Folk as well. You know, as part of the training that a quip does, and one of the, the, the, the session, we kind of talking about intimacy needs and how do we meet our intimacy needs and healthy ways. And one of the things I always do is I kind of surveyed that the crowd and I asked, okay, who among you? Well, first I asked them to kind of reflect privately on what their needs are for intimacy on a weekly basis. Physical intimacy, spiritual intimacy, social intimacy, emotional intimacy, intellectual intimacy, radiative. And, and then I kind of survey everyone and I say, okay, raise your hand if you expect it in the next week. You're going to meet all of those intimacy needs in your relationship with Jesus alone. And almost no one ever raises their hand. And that's understandable, not because God is limited, but because our, our sense separates from God. And, and, but also God made us right to be in a relationship with other humans. And so he intended for us to need more than just relationship with God. Okay, so. Okay, so then I follow up that question with, okay, how many of you, particularly if you're married, you're going to expect it in the next week, you're going to meet all of those intimacy needs that you listed on your paper. In your relationship with Jesus and your relationship with your spouse alone. And, you know, I always get a couple of, some couples that are sitting next to each other that look over, you know, to check to see if their spouse is raising their hand because their spouse is raising their hand. They got to raise their hand too, you know. But, but usually I don't get many hands raised in either. Because many people recognize that, you know, that to be healthy, you need meaningful friendships for the relationship. With more than just Jesus and your spouse. So, so I think, yeah, we need these spiritual friendships in our communities. And, you know, obviously, we, we think that in order to have depth of relationship with our spouse, there needs to be commitment. There needs to be understanding that this person is not going to run away when he gets difficult. That we're going to stick to it. So, we're going to work through challenging parts of the relationship. So, we shouldn't be surprised that if we want friendship to be more deep, we've got to have similar commitment, willing to go deeper and to stick to it even when it gets difficult. So, I think some of it is kind of, I think, I think pastors in our churches can model, initiating those kinds of committed friendships and encourage others to do the same. Yeah, yeah, man, well said, and just as a side note, you're right, Wesley Hill's spiritual friendship. Wesley has got a lot of good books out there, but spiritual friendship is one of his that I've been reading through and yeah, would really recommend his writing. Yeah, it's great. Peter, to kind of piggyback with what you were just saying about, yeah, followers of Jesus, stepping into their communities and building these friendships and being committed to navigating the challenges or the unexpected or what have you really going to the distance. I want to kind of flip the spotlight to what it looks like for followers of Jesus to then be welcoming members of the LGBTQ community into their churches. I think, I think probably if there's one place that someone from the LGBTQ community would say, I don't feel welcome or I'm really, really anxious to go, I would probably be a church that promotes a traditional sexual ethic. And yet, those are spaces that, you know, for myself, for countless Christians, if we're honest, we've been welcomed in our brokenness, whatever that might look like, and invited to enter into the resurrection life of Jesus. So, how can, how can churches start to assess and then change their cultures to be a place that invite people to belong to and to encounter Jesus? Yeah. Yeah, so I think some, I think for good reason, right, because we, as even jellicles, we want to share the good news of Jesus, we want to welcome people on the margins to our churches. Obviously, that's those good things, but I think because of those good instincts, sometimes churches, I think are a little too rush, the getting to the place where we're inviting a group of people. Some, a subset of a group of people who don't believe in Jesus, okay, that's plenty of gay people who believe in Jesus, but we're talking about particularly, how do we invite gay people who are not Christians to our churches? So, this non-Christian subset of a group of people who feel kind of historically hurt by the church, I think we should be careful about, you know, doing that well. And, and I think before we start reaching out to people outside of our churches who are gay, I think we need to first make sure we are, we're doing what we need to do with people inside of our churches, that are gay. Because if our churches aren't yet places where the gay people in our churches committed to a traditional sexual effect are thriving with reasonable efforts, if instead what they seem to be bearing is ugly fruit, probably because of a lack of support from their local church. Why do we think gay people who are not Christians would want to visit or if they visited and saw that ugly fruit, they want to stick around? So, I think the first task of every church is with the people who are gay and committed to our beliefs already, right? We don't have a conversation with these people about sexual ethics. What they need is help thriving according to God's wisdom, making that livable in our churches. I say first really in Christians to do that well. And even if our church is what some churches are like, oh, I don't know if we have any adults that are gay and Christian in committed to a traditional sexual effect, you do have kids in your church. You do have three in five year olds who in the next three to five years are going to, some of them are going to realize the experience of the same sexual attraction. And my question for those churches is, are what those three in five year olds are hearing now? Are they going to set up those kids when they're eight or nine or ten and realize the experience of sex attraction? To believe that God's love and wisdom for gay people is true and good to embrace that, to quickly share with a parent or a pastor about this part of their life. And invite them to help them make sense of these questions. And avoid having to spend any time in the closet because they've heard their parents the pastors talk about God's love and wisdom for gay people across the life span and age appropriate ways. And an administrative safety there or our church is places where age eight, nine, ten, these kids realize the experience same sexual attraction and by either the silence they first from the church or by the painful things they first from their church. They're not sharing with the parent or pastor. They're making sense of this by themselves or with their peers or with messages in culture. And then age 13, 14, 15, they're coming out and they've already decided either you know what God, how God thinks about this is a progressive sexual effect and I'm not changing my mind or I don't believe in God at all. We got to get that right. Once we get that right, right, once we become churches where we know we're setting kids to realize the experience things like attraction we're setting them up for success. And after we become churches as a gay kind of young adults and an older adults that we have who are Christians and committed to traditional sexual effect. Once we see the narrative lighting and our churches. After those two things, then maybe consider how we can reach out and gay people outside of your churches. But I think most of our churches probably have good amount of work to do with those first two before they get to the third. Yeah. And the reason why I say that is because if you do the first two well. And you've got kids and you've got young adults and you've got older adults who are gay and Christian and committed to a traditional sexual effect. And I think that's a very good fruit right demonstrating that God's wisdom is not just true, but God's wisdom is good and beautiful for gay people. Then it's easy to unlike a people in church who don't know Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. Easy. And I think the thing that's like blow my mind this whole time is that you've really like set up for us a standard that goes beyond like you said. I think what a lot of churches teach, right? This traditional sexual ethic God's design for marriage. Like you said, we sort of like keep divorce and remarriage as an unspoken issue. And we sort of lower the bar for what we would think of as like a heterosexual marriage. You've also raised the bar I think for a single man and seeing it as God's design for life. And it's a good life. It's a life that is worth living and is worth pursuing. Maybe you can speak more to God calling your life for vocational single-ness in both how you made that decision and sort of like what drove you to it. Yeah. So kind of by the end of college while I'm not bisexual I'm not generally kind of sexually romantic attracted to women. I dated a couple of women in college who was transparent with them about my sexuality. And in the dating process kind of developed a specific desire for them. I'm not sharing this to prescribe that for any other gay people. I'm not saying that's possible for all gay people. I'm just sharing that part of my story, right? So kind of toward the end of college I knew that Christian marriage could work for me if that would God was calling me to. I also because of my sexuality had to reckon with the possibility that I would be single for a lifetime. And the study of the scriptures had to save our single-ness and wrestled with, you know, did I feel like that was a curse? Was that unfair? How do I feel about that with God? And then come to some healthy conclusions about that. So, you know, year or two after college I realized that both of these possibilities were on the table. We're on the table for me. Christian marriage could happen. Single-ness for the Lord could happen. And instead of me going and just taking what I wanted, just going and chasing down the thing I wanted, whether it was single-ness or marriage. I felt I can't explain it any other way other than urging from the Holy Spirit that I was supposed to ask God what he wanted. What he preferred. If he had a preference for which gift he wanted to give me. And after that prompting from the Holy Spirit as I said in the scriptures I realized, oh actually I think I think there's actually how we're also supposed to do it right. I mean, Paul talked about how God has one gift or some and another gift for others. Jesus talked about him after he 19, be these high teachings of marriage, but that only those who have been given the gift of marriage will be able to accept his high teachings and then he share this alarming teaching about the possibility of lifetime single-ness for the sake of the kingdom. And then he says, and only those who have been given this gift will be able to accept this radical teachings, right? So, both Paul and Jesus seem to talk about this gift. This calling that's necessary to do them well and, and, and, and, you know, the giver gives the gift. The giver gives the call and the giver is God here, not us, right? We don't do well the gifts of marriage or single-ness to each other. We receive it from God. So anyway, I started discerning asking God, praying, God, what is your preference? What, what, which, which, which of these gifts do you want to give me? And, and over a kind of a long process of three years, I think I can convince the God was calling me to vocational single-ness. That lifetime vocation of abstinent single-ness for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention. And, and, so, yeah, so that's kind of how I came to that, that that conclusion, you know, that discernment process involved lawful conversations with parents and pastors and friends and lots of studying of scripture, lots of considering what was the kind of nine to five job kingdom work that God was calling me to. That relate to, to, to, to single-ness for marriage in any way, kind of looking at my story and the bread crumbs in my story and see if there's any, a trail of bread crumbs the God of leading YouTube one conclusion or another. But, but, yeah, that's, that discernment process was like, for me, but, you know, the, the immediate next question, right? After, like, in my heart, I felt it's like confidence, okay, God is calling me to single-ness for the Lord. The most immediate next question in my, when my heart was, okay, how am I going to do this well? And, in particular, how am I going to find family? Yeah, I know I still need family. Listen, there's some people out there who feel called a single-ness and feel like they've been given this, like, extra, super special, keeping of the gifts of single-ness where they basically, like, don't need any human relationship anymore. That's not me. And, and to be honest, it's not most people I know who feel called the cellulb of the, I mean, I know a lot of Catholic priests and nuns. I know a lot of Protestant people who feel called to single-ness for the sake of the kingdom. Very few of them, I share with them, mean that they've got that super special, don't need any human intimacy anymore, gift a single-ness. So, I still need a family. And, again, and that's, that's, in many ways, how this kind of mashed-o family of brothers is intentional, Christian community, for men called to single-ness started, wasn't he recognizing my own need. And being in a conversation with my pastor and not, I mean, me asking him, like, how am I going to find this in my low-purchase? And him very humbly, very pastorally, very lovingly admitting, yeah, I don't know if our church or any church in Nashville is going to be able to offer you the kind of family you really need anytime soon. But, monasticism is the most common way historically that, and I go to an English church to be clear, not a Catholic church, but still some, some, some, some, some, appreciate, deep appreciation for tradition. You know, he said, monasticism has been the most common way to get the, the tell-the-people have found family. It's been the biggest source of the evangelism in the church. It's been the greatest source of theology in the church. It's been the greatest source of social justice in the church. So, maybe God has called you to start a monastic area in Nashville. And then maybe that monastery can teach our church how to do family in the body-cracked better. And maybe generations for now, something like the Nashville family brothers will be unnecessary, because we'll be doing family in the body of Christ. So, well, yeah. Well, thank you for that. I paint a beautiful picture. So, on that front though, because I know for when I think about my own church and I own community, I want us to do a better job of this, of teaching on vocational singleness. And, respect the humility of your pastor and saying, we need to improve as a church. And I would resonate with that for my own life, our own church and saying, man, we need to do a better job of celebrating this, whether it's for people who identify the same sex attractive, or as you said, people who just feel called to singleness. So, specifically on the front of churches in the way that we teach, how can we do a better job teaching about vocational singleness, celebrating that endorsing that, inviting those individuals into family in their faith community? Yeah. So, teaching well about it is obviously the great place to start. I mean, and I think it starts with really going through these passages and scripture that talk about singleness, to the sake of the kingdom, particularly Matthew 19 of First Corinthians 7 and walking through them, and sharing what the Lord has to say about these topics. I think one kind of challenge is there's actually a difference between the singleness we're all born into, versus the singleness that kind of committed singleness that Jesus and Paul are talking about. I call the first that we're all born into, temporary singleness, and I call the second, the committed singleness vocational singleness. And one thing I find is that when churches complete the two, temporary singleness and vocational singleness, then they tend to teach, the ways they teach about them singleness aren't very rich, aren't very robust, because they're kind of trying to make the teaching speak to all of that at the same time. The opposed to if we really can make this distinction between temporary singleness and vocational singleness and recognize it. Jesus and Matthew 19, when he's talking about living like a unit for the sake of the kingdom, he's not talking about temporary singleness, talking about a commitment, a lifetime commitment, as then the understanding of the church historically, and there's lots of evidence and scripture that why this is supposed to be a lifetime commitment. So, I'm going to lie to him, to singleness for the sake of like leveraging all that time in energy, you would have spent raising kids if you were married, and instead of sending all that extra time in energy to do even more kingdom work with undivided attention to it. So, they're not better Christians because parents are doing an equally important team to work with raising kids and do other team to work other than just raising kids to be clear. But yeah, and then, you know, in 1st Corinthians 7, the same thing we've got Paul talking about this preference that people would would persist in celibacy and celebrating that and saying in some ways that it's better, but it's not everyone's gift, but in his mind it's better, what does he mean by better again, these aren't things spiritually better, he's not saying whole year, the understanding of historically has been, it's so there's some apractical benefit. For the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention, okay, so practical benefit, not better in any kind of whole week. You know, and there's other places in scripture as well that they talk about vocational, so something that's first we got a teach about vocational thing on us and teach about I think particularly the specific kind of committed single. We can talk about the temporary single as well, the we're all born into and there's many people in our churches who feel called to marriage. But our marriage yet until kind of stuck in temporary single that's for longer than they hope to be. We're going to talk about that as well, right, but when we can play that with committed singleness, we end up just teaching, speaking to neither of them well. So I think making that distinction is really important. I think other ways that we can do this kind of vocational thing was better in our churches is we need to see it models in our home and in our churches in leadership. So parents, you know, please involve fellow people in your family's life so that your kids can see, you know, they're going to see you as parents hopefully modeling a healthy marriage Christian marriage. And, and by fellow people into your home for meals and in for kind of family rhythms so they can see a settlement person thriving for the Lord. And we need leaders in our churches who are a little bit and that kind of modeling. I think we need to celebrate vocational singleness. You know, we've got all of these holidays these things that celebrate marriage and for good reason we've got engagement parties and weddings and wedding anniversaries and baptism and baby showers and mothers day and fathers day and all these things that celebrate Christian marriage and one way or another and that's good. I'm not saying we should stop doing any of those things. But we need to find ways to celebrate vocational singleness. I think one of the key ways is when people become convinced that they're called this kind of singleness of Jesus and Paul, in cursing to make like a public commitment to that and in their church and then host like a party assorers and your church and fellowship hall and celebrate that together and then every year celebrate the anniversary of that commitment. I think that that could be really beautiful. A fourth way that I think we can really help support vocational singleness better is by helping people discern whether they're called to this right because people will provide the vocational singleness better. If they actually like identify the fact that this is what the God's calling them to and they embrace it. I think I know a lot of people maybe who are persisting in temporary singleness and aren't enjoying the full benefits of the kind of singleness of Jesus and Paul that's talked about in scripture because they're kind of halfway and halfway out. You know, they're not really committed to fully embraced this vocational singleness. So helping people discern whether God's calling into vocational singleness or Christian marriage. I think we'll help lead to healthier vocational singleness and healthier marriages. And then last and not least, a big way we can support vocational singleness in our churches is by helping them find that experience of family in the body of Christ. You know, maybe that's coaching them to help them start a monastery like I'm starting or I'm a part of. Maybe it's something like, you know, encouraging them to say deeply committed to their biological family should their extended family. So to live in the same house as as as as as as as as a sibling or a nephew or a parent and being involved in their family rhythms. Maybe it looks like um, sell the people living with an unrelated new to their family in their church and helping them raise their kids and being a part of their family rhythm. Maybe it's kind of a bigger intentional Christian community experience that's a mix of, sell the people male and female or mix of sell the people with married people. You know, there's lots of options here, but I think with common between all these options I'm suggesting is they involve lived in family and hopefully they involve. Commitment eventually to that lived in family either for a long time or a lifetime. But again, I think we're all made for that. I think that um, you know, family families. Um, I think I meant to be this like image. I think from more kind of sacramental tradition. I think family is a a small F sacramental. It helps teach us about the love in God's family within the Trinity and between Christ and the church. And one of the things that we know is true about the love in God's family between Christ and the church is that it's love is faithful. It's life long. It's persistent. Um, I think our experiences of human family ought to be life-pong lived in permanent persisting. One because we are made for that right and we're made in God's image so we're made for the same kind of love that he enjoys. But also because if our human families are lifelong committed permanent persistent in that way, it makes it easier for us to believe that God's love is faithful is permanent. So yeah. So many rich answers there. And this is not as rich of a question, but I'm going to go off script here and ask you, do you have any like favorite single people in the Christian tradition that you would like commend to us to look into. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My favorite book about, particularly about like vocational single-ness. And I think it has like a really robust teaching about it is a book by Guyney Max Therian who is a French guy who helps start the Taze or the Taze community. I always forget how to pronounce it. In in France, this is an intentional Christian community that's become like semi-famous for kind of the ways that they do. Accuminously Christian intentional Christian community. He's got a great book on these topics. So that in some little book that's what comes to mind first. You know, in my immediate circles, I've not really had any mentor to that I know well that are living the sound, which has been, you know, one of the things that they've just been. You know, one of them is difficult for me. But I am really thankful for the testimonies and for the kind of more kind of more, more in different friendship with people like Wesley Hill that you mentioned that wrote that book spiritual friendship. And the way is that he's kind of modeled living living this out well. So other people who come to mind is a guy named Barry Danilak who kind of a new friend and now mentor to me. And he's written a book called redeeming single-ness is it also a really good book about single-ness and and and then. Interestingly, there is this um, acumenically Christian brotherhood kind of similar to what we're starting here in natural what they're doing is a little bit more intense in terms of giving up more of their finances and kind of having a common work. Um, within the community. But there's an organization called Servants of the Word and it's a brotherhood up in kind of the Michigan area. Um, is where a lot of them are concentrated and and they've been a huge kind of encouragement and model for me and model for our community here. We've been learning from them a lot in particular with the guy in their name Nico who kind of it leads their their discernment. And has been a mentor to me and to us here in the National Family Brothers and those those of you who come come to mind for me. Yes, that's great. Cool. Um, do you want to direct us towards where our listeners and where we can find out more about you and your work. Hmm. Yeah, sure. So, uh, you know, I, I'm kind of my social media stuff. I, I post about all of this stuff. I post about my counseling work. I post about my personal life. I post about vocational, singal notes. I post about the National Family Brothers. I post about a quip and the work we're doing around LDBD topic. So that's probably the easiest way to to kind of stay updated is, you know, follow me on Twitter and Instagram or Facebook. My handle is P. I. E. T. E. R. L. V is an Victor. A. L. K. So Peter, those with an I L. Volk. Yeah, that's my handle on all those platforms. Um, and then kind of through those, you'll, you'll kind of find the website for these different places. But particularly if you want to learn more about. Um, E. Quip that, that, that, that a, a continuum missionary consultant that I helped lead that partner with churches to help them, uh, kind of. Uh, B places where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic. Our website is E. Quip your community dot org. Um, and yeah, if you're part of a church and you want to learn how to do this better. Um, if you're just a parent or some other kind of Christian leader and you just want to learn on your own. Well, the great three resources on our website and as well, you can email us through the website and connect with us about kind of what are ways we can partner partner with your, with your church. And then yeah, on these topics of kind of vocational single myths. Um, I and discernment on there's just two articles recently that I've written that like I'm encouraging to check out. I think they're good kind of kind of introductory conversations on this. One is an article in Christianity today called the case for vocational single. And then another, the recent article in Fabham magazine called is it is it better to to marry then to burn. Um, so which is a which is article on a first Corinthians seven nine and and kind of rethinking of some common misinterpretation of that passage. So yeah, lots of options. Right on. Well, Peter, thank you so much for yeah, not only this time together, but the courage that you've embraced to to live the way you're living both in seeking to be obedient to God and to invite people who share your story. And I'm going to do encounter that same embrace and and the beauty of God's good plans and good love and designs for people who are seems like subtracted it's a it's a high calling. I'm sure at times it's a hard calling. But we are we are blessed because of what you're doing. So thank you for this time. Thank you for this conversation. We're really grateful. Yeah, thank you guys for having me on to the channel. How about this stuff. All this it matters a lot to me. And it's encouraging to know that that it matters. Thank you.
