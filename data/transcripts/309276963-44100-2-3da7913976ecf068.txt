 What are you? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Welcome to the last part. See, I'm not trying to say it wrong. Hello, friends. Probably I am a Kent Lav, and welcome to this episode of The KLP, where we give you long-form in-person conversations that explore and inform. Today I'm excited to give you my conversation with Peter Roke. Peter is a licensed professional counselor, who founded E. QuIP, in the summer of 2014. He graduated from Vanderbilt University with highest honors in chemistry in 2013. After graduating, Peter studied at Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary for over a year with a focus on lay leadership and culture making. As a fellow of the Boston Fellows Program, he worked as a ministry development intern and completed a 26-week pastoral counseling course on relational and sexual brokenness. In 2013, Peter graduated from Libscom University at National Tennessee with his masters in clinical mental health counseling. In addition to his work with E. Quip, Peter provides counseling services to LGBTQ plus students at a local Christian University. Peter is motivated by the pain and beauty of his story and the stories of fellow gay Christians submitting their sexualities to the Lord's ship of Christ. Learn more about Peter's story by visiting E. Quip YourCommunity.org and searching for the blog post I'm gay. He is also the founder of the National Family of Brothers, where the offer family, or the offer family, to men call to vocational singleness. Sorry, I'll get that out. You can find out more about that at familyofbrothers.org. Peter believes that we are here by design and part of that design is that sexes for marriage and marriage is for a man and a woman. Yet, he is openly gay. And that is what this podcast is all about. I have so much respect for Peter in his work. He is remarkably bright, talented, and articulate gentleman who is also culturally aware, relationally inclusive, and theologically robust. I try to be around folks like that as much as possible. It was an honor and true privilege to have Peter on the podcast. I think you will enjoy it as much as I did. If you're new to the KLP, welcome.

Peter, welcome to the podcast. Glad to be here. Yeah, pleasure to have you. Congratulations on the Christianity today article. That's sort of a big deal. Yeah, it was that's kind of a big website. I've never published a blog on that website, probably never will, but congratulations. Well, I'm really thankful for the people who passed me on to them and the editor there that I worked with. Yeah, that's really great. So we want to talk about that. I want to ask you first, though, how is the vaccine? You got that this week, right? It's good. Recently. Yes, the COVID-19 vaccine. We could go to be out there. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Okay. So as of today, I am 95% protected or whatever. So it was great. I'm a licensed professional counselor. Yep. So we qualified in the second round of healthcare providers to get the vaccine in. Okay. Yeah, mostly side of that free. Other than the second dose, I had a little bit of side effects for 24 hours, but okay. It was not bad. When did you get the first dose? It was the day after my birthday. It was your free eighth. I just remember because my birthday was on the seventh. Yeah, your birthday was right after all that mess, then because that was a six that went down capital, right? Yeah. So very grateful. It was for sure. Yeah, for sure. It was. I started 30. I got the vaccine. Oh, really? Congratulations. Yeah. No, I forgot about that. I remember now seeing that on Instagram 30's a big deal too. Yeah. So you got the first dose, Janie, were the eighth and you got the second dose last week. So there were three weeks apart, two weeks apart. Yeah, that sounds about right. Okay. Yeah. And what did you feel anything from the first dose? Nothing at all. Couldn't. Okay. Almost just like you're just giving blood or something. Just like a shot and it's so not but no side effects. And the second one, you felt you felt some stuff. I don't know much about the vaccine. This one just curious. Yeah. So I think from what I heard beforehand and afterward, what I experienced was pretty con, which was like 10 to 12 hours after the second dose. I, uh, well, I was started feeling a little loopy. My roommates and I were actually pirates of the Caribbean. Yeah. And one of our roommates birthday. And his request was to watch like the original pirates of the Caribbean. And I noticed myself finding it a little too entertaining. Oh, real? And I had to add a little beverage or anything. So I was like, not sure what was going on. Play it on the vaccine. No, it was. I just waited. I just waited. I just waited to entertain. Oh, really? And then the, the muscle aches and the headache. And then I had a really strange dream. Like, I dream often enough. But this was probably one of the scary streams I've ever had. And I've heard people say when they like have COVID that they had like very vivid dream. Really. I haven't done I don't know if this was like, yeah, COVID dream light or something. But yeah, that was like a night after the second dose or just thereabouts like soon after night after. Okay. Yeah. So I got it in the morning and then that night. And then how long did those side effects hang around like a couple of days. You felt that way or primarily just that day or 24 hours. I'd say by the next day. Okay. Yeah. I feel anything different. And so it's fine. What I'm not funny, but what's interesting about that is like that's how some people experience COVID-19, right? The difference is though, by taking the vaccine, like in theory, you don't spread the virus anymore. Is that, is it right? Do you know? Yeah. So I did because I have roommates who don't have the vaccine yet. We were curious. Okay. What does this mean for me and my level of caution and their level of caution? And we did some some deep research. And they don't have the final like results yet of the studies they've done with people who have had vaccines. As to whether they could still like be carriers of coronavirus and pass it on to other people. But the closest, I guess, analog are research about people who are test positive for COVID, but are truly asymptomatic. Whether they can spread COVID. And a number of the most like rigorous studies show that if someone is test positive for COVID, but has zero symptoms, it's much less likely that they can pass COVID on to someone else. Oh, really? So it's almost like how the virus affects you is going to have some indication on how you might spread it or how quickly readily you might spread it to others. Like if you get the virus in your basically asymptomatic, you don't have a high likelihood of spreading into other people. And then some people get it like months later, right? I think they're still learning some things because initially it was thought what if you get it then you probably don't get it again. But then some people did get it again. But it was like months later, there's just sort of this, yeah. I don't know much about, I mean quite honestly, I'm kind of ready to just get it. Get it done. You know what I mean? Like let's just do whatever we got to do to get life back to somewhat normal. That was my latest motivation. The sooner I get the vaccine and say yes to that, the sooner I get back to normal life. Yeah, which you're around people with your counseling practice. So I could see that. I think I mean, you know, there's different opinions on the vaccine, right? I mean, I don't hold a very strong opinion. I'm happy if it's beneficial. I'm not in a rush to go get it, which apparently I couldn't even get it anyway, right? Like they're they're giving you have to qualify right now. So yeah, with whatever you do for work or however that works out. But hey, man, happy to hear you got it. Happy to hear us working well. Yeah, I'm glad. And so did you get COVID or? No, as far as you need to. I'd at least in my circle of friends. I don't know a lot of people who got it. Okay. But we all, I think thought it was going to happen. Like I thought it was inevitable that I would get it at some point in time. That's what I thought. I'll tell you. I've gotten through it. I've gotten through this season. Yeah. Having gotten COVID and now hopefully more and more of us will get vaccinated and we'll move on from this. Yeah. I'm really grateful. So I agree. By the way, there's water there. If you want water. Yeah, I'll probably need that. Yeah, just grab one. Well, hey, man, it's Friday afternoon. We made it through another week. Thank you for coming by. I appreciate your time. I was really looking forward to this one. Yeah, we're looking forward to it. It's been a long week for me. So I really like the end of it. Okay. Why so? Well, um, uh, I've got a, as we'll probably chat about a number of different things. I know to say you have a lot of things in your life. That's Diana. Too many, too many jars of honey, possibly. I don't know what the, the firm for phrases, but particularly, uh, the, I'm a, in the Anglican churches of North America, in Anglican, I'm in the process of ordination. And they recently released a statement on kind of topics of sexuality and identity. So I involved in those conversations and teaching around those topics in those spaces. So very, very busy, you know, responding to all of that. Okay, cool. Well, if you're in the Anglican tradition being or Dane, or you love to drink bourbon or no. Yes. Do you drink bourbon? Do you want a little bit? Uh, eventually. Okay. Let's hit that later. Um, I do follow Trace though. Uh, me too. Uh, yeah. I have friends and know everything about bourbon. And apparently Buffalo Trace changed some things recently where they're trying to create some scarcity. It's, it's probably a good business move, but I didn't really know about that, but the last couple of times I went into get some Buffalo Trace. It wasn't there. Oh. And then they said they're starting to like create some scarcity and make, you know, whatever. So it's definitely barrel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like not sell it. So frequently through stores and kind of like make it a bigger thing where it's harder to get blah, blah, blah, supply and demand. I don't know. I don't know much about that world. I just, this is literally on the podcast. Only time to ever drink bourbon. Anyhow, let's hear, let's start with though who you are and what you do. Let's come back around to your stories. We can jump into that. But you kind of get people an overview. Like you mentioned, you are into a bunch of different things. A lot of which you've started yourself. So I want to hear about some, some of those things for sure, but let's just give people an overview. Yeah. Well, okay. So the thing I spend the most time doing or my at least my day job is a, I help start an organization called Equip, which we're a team of, of missionary consultants, who help churches become places where gay people could thrive according to a traditional sexual effect. According to a belief that God's best for every Christian is a commitment to life long, celibate, singleness for the sake of the kingdom or life long marriage between a man and a woman to raise kids together to the church. So that's my day job, partnering with churches and providing training and coaching and teaching so that they can become those places of thriving. And you started Equip as well, right? Yeah. Did you found it yourself? Did you have a co-founder? I did find it found it myself. Okay. And but I've got a lot of great co-workers now, which is really good. Yeah. I noticed that, but you started this in like 13 or 14, right? Equip. And so this is your day job. Yeah. Okay. So but you're also, and I don't mean to cut you off because you're telling us kind of giving us an overview. But but your role is, as a counselor, is that three week quick, or is that something separate then? So separate from that. Yeah. I am a licensed professional counselor and about a half day a week, I meet with some clients in private practice, separate from the work of Equip. But serving similar people. So you know, the work in my private counseling practice, I meet mostly with individuals who are gay and Christian. And we find a way to navigate that according to a traditional sexual ethic. I see. And then in the work of a quip, a lot of what we're doing is training pastors and parents. Two better minister to gay people. So coming at the same problem or the same challenges or the same needs, but from different angles with the counseling versus the consulting work with church. Yes. Okay. And then a quip is this donor funded. How do you how do you pay your staff? Yeah. We're 80% supported by donations. Okay. Friends and family and people who believe in the work. And then 20% of our funds come from fees for service from churches. And that's been intentional from the beginning because what we want to do with churches is the long-term high-touch work. We engage in churches with churches in five to ten year-long partnerships to roll out this kind of work in the church. So if the churches we work with had to pay per hour full price, you know, what what other organizations that do similar work to Equip, if they had to pay that full price for every hour, they couldn't afford it. And so that's why we fund rates. So that we can offer our services to churches at much lower rate. Five to ten years is a normal kind of partnership or working relationship with the church. Okay. That's surprising me. So you were not, this is not like a three-hour Zoom call or a half a day workshop or an online course. Maybe there's some of that, but generally if a church really wants to enact change and build in and have you guys help them to do it, like this is a long, multi-year relationship. Yeah, so we definitely have some of those early steps that churches can take. Our little simpler and a little take less time. Right. But for the churches that we work with that really want to become that place where gay people can thrive according to God's wisdom. For most of the churches we work with, there's a lot of steps that they need to take and take them slowly, take them carefully. For most churches they've got three or four priorities that they're focusing on right now and this isn't the only thing that's taking their attention. Right. And we also want to make sure that we get buy-in from leadership at their churches and from people in their churches that may have different beliefs or different perspectives on this and move slowly and carefully to educate parents and to educate the average member and to the right conversations with teenagers and make sure we get parents and pastors the training they need to provide good pastoral care and support all of that. So it takes time. I'm sure because you're not just spinning up a new program, you're changing the culture of the church probably in a lot of cases, right? Or in some cases? Yeah, in a lot of cases, I mean we we're convinced that to have conversations about LGBT topics well in our churches that needs to be a part of a broader conversation about how God has called all Christians to steward their sexuality and God on ring ways. So so we're kind of backing up or resuming out and we're asking churches, are you doing that conversation well? And most of the churches that we partnered with say, oh we need help with that too, right? We need to do this whole thing better and before we get to maybe detailed conversations about LGBT topics, let's talk about God's call for everyone to steward their sexuality as well. Let's talk about that first. Let's do that well first. So but even doing that well takes time. I have to ask now just because it popped up is why do you think that this aspect or this subject stewarding or sexuality has not been something that the church has been sort of focused on teaching on making it priority more because just a one thing that comes to mind is like I just feel like financial steward ship is something where the church has been excited about talking about for some time. Right? I mean let's be honest. I mean this goes back to the 90s you know what I mean maybe even before. Well I'm even before but um but I have to think like for the last 20 years there's probably if you were to like look at the churches probably a lot more discussions on financial steward ship than sexual you know sexuality stewardship until maybe this subject has become almost like forced in the last few years which is probably good that it's becoming forced. Why do you think that is? Yeah churches or denominations that have maybe theological beliefs more on one extreme or another those spaces probably have been talking about this plenty but my experience and a lot of the churches that we work with. Our churches that maybe in terms of culturally find themselves kind of more in the middle while still holding more historical theological beliefs and in those spaces there's a lot of incentives not to talk about this because they have people that go to their troops and have a mix of beliefs and um those often tend to be maybe more secret friendly churches or churches that are kind of doing the simple church model and talking about controversial topics it doesn't fit well with the simple church model. Yeah and so and I think also maybe they remember many of the people who are leading those kind of churches now that maybe want to offer this compassionate orthodoxy or this kind of middle way that that holds on to biblical truth but offers it in a win some way they grew up in churches that were were screaming about the culture wars when it came to divorce or gay marriage or whatever and they saw that that drove people away from Jesus and they're afraid that there's no way to talk about these topics that won't scare people away from Jesus and so they just say why don't we just postpone postpone postpone this conversation but it can get postpone for a whole generation I was originally working with the youth pastor at the church I go to with the teens there talking about these topics and what we quickly realized was none of them have had heard from their parents or their church in kind of elementary school age or in middle school had heard them talk about these topics because everyone was assuming someone else was going to do it that's right and it had no education of how how does god talk all of us to think carefully about our capacities for relationship and and our bodies and the wisest ways to steward those in honor god and enjoy the good things god has made us for yes whereas if you're going to talk about financial steward ship then you're talking about some things where it's kind of hard to disagree with like right it's like you know don't spend more than you make and don't rack up a bunch of credit card debt or consumer debt and you know give generously in those types of things it's kind of like I mean part of the French was kind of like but no shit you know what I mean it's like but no one's going to disagree with that so maybe that's why that's why the church would maybe be quicker or more readily like talk about some of those things and talk about some of these things over here where there are different views and you're going to get into disagreement and you have to go sort of faithfully investigate what the scripture would have to say and look at scripture's grand narrative and creations principles and those types of things yeah I can see that sure that makes sense what is what what would an average case study look like for equipped to get involved with the church let's say it's a church it does wind up being a five-year-old ship or whatever yeah so they get involved with you they start to have some discussions at some point you go and like give a talk at that church on the Sunday night or Sunday morning or Wednesday night or whatever like are you involved at that level or you like working with the leadership and coaching them as they roll out the changes that they want to make more so the second more so partnering coaching training for the leaders and then they go talk to the people in the church so the first big step with that we take with churches is what we call our blueprint process and it's kind of 12-hour many strategic plan process around this particular area of ministry at their church and it's particularly for their key leaders six to ten leaders in person at their church um well like a trick of it and even doing COVID we've been trying to do some of this virtually and are looking back to getting looking forward to getting back to that yeah but like listen this would look like two half days or one twelve-hour day or um if they're more local and we do prefer to uh work with churches that I could drive yeah we do them in kind of a session every other week I see okay I've got plenty of time to unpack in between I see so two and a half hours every other week okay and yes that that that deepens their knowledge and their understanding and increases their capacity to to disciple to minister around these topics but the big goal of that process is they identify what are the needs in our church how how could we do we be doing this better what's a vision paint that picture what it looks like we think it looks like for our church to be doing this better five to ten years from now and then three what are all the steps what's the strategy to get there what are the steps we need to take um and then we basically go from there and we help them implement that blueprint implement that strategy over the next three five years um so for a lot of churches that that looks like um how do we make sure that everyone in our churches thinking theologically about sexual stewardship how do we you know make sure our leaders know how to teach that and our parents know how to teach that um how do we eventually get to the place where we have public conversation about these LGBT topics both so straight people in our churches know how to have these conversations and love the gay people in their life well and so that gay people in our churches have clarity about what our church believes and whether or not this is the church they want to be at and and whether it's safe to share their story fully um another kind of big priority for us in churches we work with is um making sure that we share about gods love and wisdom for gay people um particularly with with the kids with children teens before they get to the age where they might realize there's the they experience same sex attraction um because right now there's this average five year gap between when a kid first realizes they experience same sex attraction versus when they first tell a parent or a pastor really yeah and so it's five years that like it was and I was a statistic it was five years for me that I was making sense of these topics all by myself and that's not a good recipe right because I was left alone with whatever uh messages from culture and whatever lies of the enemy uh we're around me right so what instead how can we you know before at age 10 age eight make sure in age appropriate ways our churches are sharing with every kid about gods love and wisdom for gay people so as soon as a kid realizes that that this is a part of their story they share with a parent or they share with a pastor that's a big priority for how love that and I don't I don't I don't know man I you know some of these things it's always hard to tell like you have an objective look at where things are actually or if it's just your personal experience you don't know what I mean but I kind of feel like what you're saying was missing in the 90s maybe it was probably missing in the 80s and the 70s and the 60s and the 50s and the 40s too but you know being born in 84 you know kind of knowing a little bit more what's going on and like the late 80s and 90s I feel like that was missing. Yeah uh do you feel like that also do you feel like we're making some at least with your equipment the other ministries out there like this do you feel like this has always been out there is just or has there been a real drought here and we need more things like equipped. Things are definitely getting better okay but in terms of uh there's more in by better there's more ministry there's more awareness there's more conversations there those types of things. I think what's changed is um in the in the 80s I think most people assumed that um if a gay person just went and married someone of the opposite sex they would become straight or if they just prayed hard enough for God to make them straight they would become straight. So if anyone is still gay it's because they want to be. Yes and I think in a healthy way we've come to and we've seen the statistics from different kind of research about sexual orientation change efforts it's just not how it works you know I think the the best studies only three to four percent of the time do this does someone who seeks out some kind of sexual orientation change efforts experience an meaningful amount of change for most people this is just an enduring part of their life even if they don't want uh to be attracted to people of the same thing so so I think accepting that fact accepting that for most people it's not God's will that their sexual orientation changes then we've got a very different question we're asking the question isn't how do we change or fix or eliminate this problem but instead there are Christians who by no choice of their own are going to experience enduring same sex attractions how can we be a church where they can faithfully steward those in God honoring ways and still find healthy family in the body of Christ. Yes and that shift didn't happen until the past decade really okay that's what I perceived too but you saying it yeah makes makes sense let's come back to all that because there's so much thing we do there we open up a lot of kids yeah yeah I'm glad we did too by the way so all right so equipped and by the way like how many just for context what does this organization look like like if you have a few people on staff yeah I'm full time and then I've got three other staff who are part of time okay and then is there other organizations like like you out there yeah I would say some people may know of a guy named Preston Springkel and the organization the center for faith sexuality and gender they do some similar but different work and the organization lead them home or posture shift led by a guy named Bill Henson they do some similar but different work so they're both friends they Nashville no one he I think is based out of Idaho okay the other based out of Boston but all of us kind of do work on a national level so equipped as I've done we've done work with churches in Montana and in New Jersey and in Georgia and in Tennessee obviously and lots of different places in the organizations you just mentioned the two others would they have a very similar theological view as you do yeah same theological perspective and they're just the tools that they're offering churches are a little different okay sure but from the same convictions but from that from the standpoint of sharing your convictions or theological views is there I mean is there like a half a dozen organizations out there or is there dozens because it doesn't sound like there's dozens right unless in terms of organizations that are offering training to pastors to churches on these topics less less than a dozen you know half dozen the those three including equipped that I work for are kind of the ones that I think seem to do the most work I'm probably forgetting someone and I'm sorry I am and I think that's because there used to be a lot of organizations doing work like this in the 70s and 80s based on the assumption that people's sexual orientation could change if they prayed hard enough and then all that kind of collapsed in the 2000s and a lot of leaders running those organizations kind of went down with the ship and it had a really painful and sad way and so you know the lead them home is organization has been around for even less time than a quick has been we've been around for six years I think the Center for Faith's been around for like four years lead them home or posture shift has been around for seven or eight years so all each of these three organizations are fairly young and kind of rose up out of the ashes of the kind of pre the gateway movement imploding wow so how much damage was done in that pre the gay away movement I mean my goodness a lot allegedly yeah there was a recent movie called Boyer Raced that was a kind of about that movement and and some of it is documentary it's like a it's based on a book that was an autobiography from someone's experience going through one of those programs so it's you know it's a drama I feel like I'm a bit is a drama movie yeah okay and I think it captures maybe some of the messages and some of the experiences that people had in that ministry but there's a great book by Andrew Mayron called Us versus Us and in that book he points out a couple of things and one of the things he points out is that while gay people on average we're actually a more churched people growing up than the average American so 86% of LGBT plus people grew up in church compared to only I think 73% on the average American so gay people actually more likely to have grown up in church but 54% of LGBT people have lost their faith or left the faith in the past kind of I think half century is what he was doing this research over and and a lot of that can be a attributed to kind of these pray the gay away efforts the book because once if the story you tell someone is there is a god and this god loves you and for you to prove to this god that you love him you'll ask for him to take this away and if he's not taking this away it must be because you don't want it enough it must be because you're not doing it right and then if he keeps on not taking it away and keeps on not taking away eventually you either kind of believe that that god doesn't exist or that God hates you yes and it's really hard for someone like that to hold on to their faith yeah yeah that's really sad man because it's just another it's another example of how so how so easy it is to get the gospel wrong yeah you know what I mean you don't have to work yourself up into a position where you can appease God you know that is so not the gospel I mean my wife is reading the whole Christ have you ever read that yes sinclair Ferguson wonderful book and she is reread the chapter on legalism and she grew up omish and this is not a knock on the omish because they're not they're not all legalistic but there's a lot of roles so some are you know what I mean and and it's something you're going to have to work through and so you know there's lots of you know truly born again believers in that culture tradition or whatever but it has a lot of baggage too and you have that many roles and she was reading through this chapter on legalism twice and just like you you are saved and then you are righteous like you you can't become righteous and then get save is so not how it works you know what I mean and this is just another example of with our sexuality of how we get the gospel wrong I mean it's just it's so rampant sat I think with the the church at large and and I guess America that's our context but where were we we were talking about pray the gay way and equip and well we also need to hear what else you're into I think that's where we're sort of yeah long introduction yeah let's go back to that all right so equip and I know you're into some other stuff too let's hear about that yeah so equip in the counseling is what I get paid to do okay there's some other things I don't get paid to do but that I really enjoy doing one of them is so one of them is helping start an intentional Christian community a brotherhood for Christian men who feel called to lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom and our kind of communities called the Nashville family of brothers and so I've been a part of starting that right now there's there's five of us who live in a house together and we do prayer together every morning and we do a certain number of meals each week together and we do we can do confession once a week and we do kind of a Saturday night welcoming the Sabbath worship time once a month and we do vacation together and we do some holidays together we like alternate Thanksgiving and Christmas is with the Nashville family of brothers versus biological family but then we all all have like normal jobs nine to five jobs I mean right now a lot of us are working from home because of COVID but we all have jobs outside we do not get paid by the community that we live in yeah we are all part of our local churches different local churches actually say a chemineically Christian and we're still very much connected to to parents and and kids in our churches and to other friends outside of our communities we're not cloistered in any way so in some ways it's kind of like a monastery in other ways it's not like a monastery but yeah helping build develop that is a big part of my life and and what's meaningful for me is you know guys make one year commitments to this community and then three year commitments to this community and then eventually make lifetime commitments to this community which is what I think to me the most beautiful part is even in singleness for the Lord I will know who my people are 10 20 30 years from now right and that's really important because at least when I look at read scripture and I see where Jesus and Paul are talking about singleness for the sake of the kingdom it's not saying loneliness for the sake of the kingdom and there's lots of indications that that what Jesus or Paul intended was for people called a single nurse for the Lord to still have a rich experience of family and the body of Christ so that's what we're trying to make happen with the Nashville family of brothers yep yeah well I want to come back to that and we covered the main things you're into is anything else you want to call out some some writing projects and some some some kind of and that's kind of what brought about this this CT article related to discernment and vocational singleness but as you can sell all the things I do I'm involved in all kind of we've it out of each other they're all inter related yeah well I love that about you you know you're not afraid to well you're not afraid to use the gift that's within you you know like this is something that's near and dear to your heart you have experienced this you have some pretty clear theological thoughts around it you have the ability to express those thoughts and so you do it like I I really commend you for that man because I'm sure there's most some days it's bees you're not to I get tired yeah I'm sure you do and also can you well I want to just the Nashville band of say not not Nashville band of brothers family of brothers but Nashville family brothers Nashville band of brothers is the most frequent like when people are trying to recall the name how is it if they don't remember the name okay like the actual I just that that is the one that was going to be by both URLs and your fine if I was I was yes if I was talking to some kind of branding expert they probably say listen you should just change it to the Nashville band of brothers because that's whatever it wants it to be I wouldn't be so quick to because I think family family is important it is important yeah and I really really love that idea because I just feel like that is it's very very biblical and if that is your experience and these are your inclinations these these are these are your feelings this is what you deal with but these are your theological viewpoints about what's scripture and how creation was designed is so forth that that that marriage is for male female this is what you need to do man I mean living by yourself dude no way now this just seems to make so much sense yeah and it feels very there's something very New Testament about it I just feel like so I just think it's really I hope it continue I hope you get like hope it continues to work yeah and people have moved in from out of town for this is that correct this is not just oh I happen to be a Nashville so I'm going to go look this is like this is like this is matters so much where someone might move and live in this house with you guys and commit to this to this community yeah we had one guy move from Chicago to Nashville to join this community and another my guy moved from Dallas to Nashville to join this community so yeah I mean and interesting you're bringing up it feels kind of very New Testament I because these are the the things I'm interested in I was recently researching like what did singleness committed singleness look like in the early church like the first two three four hundred years of the church and it was actually fairly common um people who kind of made permanent commitments both in their heart and sometimes publicly to to be single for the Lord and what was most common was they were they were still involved in like the the economy of their city they were still working in one way or another and they were still involved in their local church they weren't they weren't out in the desert yet or out in caves yet but they did tend to kind of gather in like groups groups of you know five to ten other men or other women in live in a house together that was the most common way and there was the I can't remember the exact pronunciation of the the word like the the rim new off the rim new with something like that I can't remember what the the Greek word was but it basically means like kind of city monks uh city celibates and um so I like to think that that's what we're doing we're like city celibates we're like city monks I love that well what I see is I see that it's plausible our our pastor TJ Timbs it is PhD thesis a couple years ago on plausibility structures and the new commitment and and and so I had really heard about plausibility structures much before that so um but the idea is that you know that all aside if you are supposed to for you feel a calling to be celibate the rest of your life and live by yourself and not be in community that's barely plausible let's just be honest you know what I mean like that's a difficult it's not how humans are I don't know I feel like there's it's just not how we're designed right we're designed for community and fellowship and sisterhood brotherhood whatever and you get a certain amount of that in in marriage and in a family it's not ultimate but you get a certain amount of that but with what you're doing this this to me seems plausible like it seems feasible like if this is what you believe I can see this really working and bringing fruit in someone's life for the rest of their life yeah I really I think the what you're doing there I can really see like the foundation for it is scriptural yeah I mean and that was and that was important for us because we didn't want to just come up with a crazy idea and see if it could work because these are people's lives we're talking about and so a lot of the people guys who were saying I have a need for something like this but but why should I take a chance with this version of it which I think is a good question so for us it was a lot of research of in the history of the church how have people done this well what what stuff has worked what are other brotherhoods doing something similar to this right now what works about that what doesn't so yeah so while this it's made this look or feel like a new idea to a lot of people we're really just putting a new skin on things that have been done for hundreds of years yeah so well yeah and it's also not it has some similarities with some other groups there was a guy on here I think what Smith was his name a guy in town I think he owns two homes I think that recovering alcoholics live in they do very much the same they just live there and but they all have their jobs and they've all agreed together they're going to stop drinking alcohol because it has you know it's kind of owned their life in the past and they're done with that and it's I guess it's sort of like alcoholics anonymous to another degree like a few lived together and like because you know that if you don't take it this seriously it could lead to very bad results again and so you're seriously enough about you know about this change and about following you know these principles that you're willing to to live together and do life together and help each other yeah along the way I mean it's very it's very it's that's very scriptural yeah and we I a big reason why we do this I mean yes we all need family like I think God made us all for family there's lots of ways to interpret like what we see in Genesis 2 when when God says it's not good for man to be alone but I think what God is saying is like I put you in human bodies I made you for relationship with other humans it's not good for you to be without human companionship yeah we still need God right obviously we still need God we also need human companionship and we're destined for a physical new heavens and new earth where we will still enjoy human companionship and perfect human with God so that just it makes a whole lot of sense but but our yeah our community isn't just for making sure we have some stable permanent human companionship it's it's have that so that that empowers us to use our availability in singleness to do kingdom work so particularly our availability from not raising kids so raising kids is really important kingdom work the the Christian parents do and it takes a lot of time and energy um I only know from looking at it from the outside and being a God parent I know a little bit of a little bit of it right yeah takes a lot of time and energy so um when Jesus and Paul talk about this singleness for the sake of the kingdom what they're particularly talking about is people using all of that time and energy that they would have used to raise kids and and and then reinvesting all of that time and energy instead into even more kingdom work into doing focusing perhaps on projects and and and and just just work and and ministry work that parents don't have the margin to do because they're doing other really important kingdom work yeah so we so we see our house is in some ways of like an aircraft carrier it fuels us it sustains us to the send us out particularly in our nine to five jobs to go serve our city and heal in our city and do the kingdom worth it God has called us to do with with with with a with a vigor and and with a life that that that we couldn't do if we were living alone yeah or that would be difficult to do if we had had had a spousen kids that we needed to attend to and we needed to serve and we deserve some of our energy for I mean I have to ask now because I'm curious I mean there might be someone listening this that's kind of ready to think in the same thing but I mean I just have to ask me where did you come from like this is so this is so right you know what I mean it's so right and it's so scriptural and it's so committed and I I have not talked to many people that are seeing it as clearly as you're seeing it and willing to commit their life to this and change their lifestyle to adjust accordingly and benefit other people that are dealing with the same thing I mean this seems really rare and it seems like it shouldn't be so rare but I don't know this is what you're this is it's not going to be as rare in the future based on the work that you're doing I hope not I mean I think that some of the goal and I'm particularly excited about this for the Nashville family of brothers is that this could become like a little bit of a model for for this kind of brotherhood and sisterhood in other cities we've been praying for a Nashville family of sisters and actually right now we there's a couple of people we've met in Los Angeles who are in the early stages of starting an LA family of brothers cool so we'll see where this goes but yeah I mean I I think some of what the the CT article speaks to is that we need more Christians to consider singleness for the sake of kingdom and and I and I I think we also need more Christians to settle down into Christian marriage I think we actually need more of both um but one of the things one of the structures one of the things to make singleness for the sake of the kingdom plausible is we need like this this practical way to find family in singleness yeah and so I yeah I hope that becomes a more common part of our churches and our cities um because I I think it could make a big difference yeah let's be clear on what it is that you believe because it seems to me that what it is that you believe has people that just made made disagree from both sides oh yeah okay stay as clear as you can what it is that you're that we're talking about here let's just make it super honest and I probably should have said I've talked about a lot of the you probably should share a little bit more you know why why do I care about a lot of these topics so much a lot of this is in this intersection of faith and sexuality uh you know so I am a Christian hopefully that's obvious from the things I've said already I'm gay um and and I'm convinced that God's best for me is either a lifetime commitment to sell a bit singleness for the sake of the kingdom or a lifetime commitment to marriage with a woman for the sake of raising kids um and I'll say for me that that wasn't an obvious decision I mean well I'm not bisexual I'm not generally attracted to women I did date a couple of women in college and was very honest with them early in my dating relationship about my sexuality and I said I don't understand this but like I kind of think you're cool do you want to go on a date like you know this part of my story no expectations let's just have fun and and I in those dating relationships grew a specific desire for those women it wasn't it wasn't the exact same as as the ways that I was attracted to some men but um but it was meaningful enough like I knew that if God wanted me to to walk out Christian marriage God wanted that for me that could work but for me a couple years out of college it it seemed obvious I felt this tug from the Holy Spirit that I was actually supposed to ask God which he wanted me to do instead of just going and taking marriage because I wanted it or because it was it's more convenient in some ways or taking singleness because I wanted it was more convenient in some ways he wanted me to to discern to go to him and ask him God do you have a preference for me and I felt God call me me particularly to committing to that lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom so so I'd say you know and and for the guys in the Nashville family of brothers they're they're a variety of backgrounds and sexual orientations and and and part of considering whether or not this community is for them is discerning God are you calling me to Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex or you calling me to this vocational singleness for the sake of the kingdom so yeah so that's a big part of my story and and it isn't it isn't right I don't I think regardless of whether or not I develop same sex attraction I think God would have called me to vocational singleness but I will recognize that it was particularly because I'm gay that I ever paused to think about anything other than marriage right like that's the only reason I stopped in college to think oh well I can't marry a man because I don't think that that's God's best for me and I'm not sure if I could marry a woman but I and I don't want to be single what does the Bible have to say about single what's you know okay I would never have done that if if I wasn't if I wasn't gay so yeah that is a big part of of this whole journey yep by the way do you have and Lincoln can you grab my jacket there it's so cold in this building the it's just concrete block walls and yeah cold week in national man I'm ready for spring yeah just grab my jacket if you don't mind real quick Lincoln okay real quick question do you have guys the Nashville family of brothers house that are not same sex-attracted and they just are there because they're choosing to live a single cell of a life for whatever reason for the glory of God and that's whether they're or is it they're all they're all dealing with the same sex attraction to some degree thank you yeah um I can say that among kind of the you know 20 to 30 guys over the past three years who have kind of discerned with us at any meaningful level we've definitely had a mix of guys who are gay and straight okay but but I'll say what's been true of all of them is even the ones who are gay and not bisexual and I think maybe have a similar kind of experiences me each of them have who have who have discerned with us in a meaningful way have tried to lean into this question of of God I really want to honestly ask you do you have Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex or vocational singleness for me and even for even if for some of those guys if they're gay and if they've never dated someone of the opposite sex they've never had a sense that that could work for them at least be emotionally and and theological and intellectually open to the possibility of God calling them to that and that's important because when we if someone feels forced into celibacy you know like in reddit channels like it uh like a involuntary celibate an in cell is a thing uh that could be a talk about um and and not in a good way yeah sure but there's lots of people in this world who are not gay and feel like they're involuntarily celibate and that feeling of being forced into celibacy doesn't lead to someone embracing and living out celibacy well yeah I'm sure regardless of their sexual orientation so we think it's really important for these guys regardless of their sexual orientation to open handedly discern both options so the even if God does call them to celibacy and they suspected that what this work I would have for them they see it as there was a choice there was an option God particularly wants this one for me okay I'm gonna reach out and I'm gonna accept that gift that God is offering and embrace it and own it like this is this is not something I'm being forced into or pushed into or defaulted to this is what I'm choosing for me yep yep okay so you believe that sexual intercourse is for marriage yeah well so it's tricky when we there's one conversation about kind of natural marriage and what is good for humans in general I think there's another conversation about like what is God's best for Christians in particular what is what is Christian marriage that God blesses and sustains in a unique way and and so I think it's a different conversation we're talking about non-Christians or talking about an atmosphere of politics but we're particularly talking about four Christians right for people who like say Jesus is their Lord and Savior yeah and they're wondering what is what is best for them yeah I think the I think the the Christian marriage that God blesses and sustains is a lifetime commitment between one man and one woman to enjoy intimacy and to be an image of Christ relationship with the church and to raise children together pro-create and all that yeah okay you just raise an interesting point so you're not saying and I like this too you're not saying that we should just go out and tell every every person or go you know whoever we don't need to go to college dorms people that are in college say hey stop having sex outside of marriages isn't good that's I mean that's fine and it's maybe outside of God's design but we would start at that point at that level you would start with the gospel and you would try to you would try to save them first right and then after that then we can start to think about okay now that you believe in a creator and you know Jesus Christ and how that righteousness work like after you believe the gospel then let's start to think about how the Bible would have us to live then we can start to talk about sex and marriage and those types of things right that's sort of what you're saying with like all right let's narrow the discussion down too okay let's just talk about believers and if you believe in God if you believe in the Bible if you believe in Jesus Christ this is this is what you believe then about marriage if that's your belief system but you wouldn't just go out and try to make it a thing to talk about you know absence and absence until marriage with people that you know pick up and have no desire to you know that's that's what I'm going to say correct yeah and I think scripture even warns us that like people who don't who Jesus is not their Lord and Savior are gonna find a lot of the things in scripture that are like at odds with culture to be silly right or to be crazy yeah so I don't expect to convince anyone who's not a Christian to follow a traditional sexual ethic because you know if I intellectually imagine myself living in a universe where there is no God it would be it would be silly for me to put these restrictions on for us you know so yeah first yet so fully agree I just think that's such a good point because this came up in a recent podcast with a guy named Annie Skoonover in Austin Texas who had run multiple pregnancy care centers and the one thing that he was bumping into was statistically if you want to talk about just statistically now a way to get abortion down in this country is to get birth control out there but he ran into a lot of opposition from that from the sort of the conservative Christian camp because they're saying no no no they need to stop having sex sure well that's getting that issue above salvation in the gospel it's like man you go out and try to tell people to stop having sex without having a good reason why we're believing in the gospel that's a tough battle to believe you're never going to win that battle right and that's what you're saying I so I appreciate that okay so you're saying if you believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ you would believe that sex is for marriage and marriages for male and female okay so so by believing that you're going to get a lot of disagreement from you know a whole bunch of people yeah but then you're also saying you don't believe it's right to sort of to use your term pray the gay away or at least I don't think it's it's possible yeah okay if you can it would for some people it would be convenient if that was not sure but it's just not effective well and also just to be clear be convenient for other people I feel like not maybe not so much for the people that are that way but like for the people around them maybe about easier for them if you could pray for me I mean it it caused a lot of hardship in my life growing up and certainly when I was in you know eight nine ten year old when I started to realize that this was part of my life it would have made my life a whole lot better if I could have just asked God to take it away and he did oh I'm sure yeah no I really believe that and at the same time when I look over the past ten years of my life most of the the most beautiful things in my life have come from wrestling with this way that I'm broken with God and in community with other believers like it's it's hard to imagine me without without without the contrast of this brokenness mm mm so I'm not I don't think God intended for me to be gay I don't think he like or damed for me to experience develops same sex attraction I don't think that's how it continuar but God has been really faithful to to to to redeem this in my life for my good and his glory and it's hard to imagine my story without that that goodness in my life and that glory to God yeah praise God for that yeah for sure yeah so it just strikes me as your sort of I mean this is probably what you would believe and I and I would agree with him leave as well like you're taking the way of the gospel it's this third way and you're gonna get opposition from not to not to say the political right left but you're gonna get opposition from both sides on this right because you're gonna get opposition you probably have gotten opposition from the sort of camp that the Christian camp that would say oh I have fully agree marriages for men and women but the gay thing dude you gotta stop that you know what I mean right yeah or some people who kind of wish I wouldn't use the word gay to describe myself or wish I would just kind of downplay that part of my story as much as possible you know I mean I I don't think I don't present as like a particularly flamboyant gay person I mean I don't have a rainbow shirt on and I don't have like like sweet dyed hair or something yeah just because that's not my style not because I think there's something inherently problematic with that yeah but so maybe it's a little easier for me to kind of like pass as like any other person but but still there's some people who who say why do you always have to bring it up my face why you always have to call yourself gay why do you always mention this part of your story can you just chill out so I get that from some from some directions okay so there that's speaking to something that I wanted to bring up they're sort of saying you know if you think about that line of thought it's sort of like don't sense they I don't want to put words in them out but it's almost like they think like you're sensationalizing it a little bit that you're making it a thing where maybe it doesn't need to be a thing that you're that you're putting in their face a little bit and don't you think they're sort of because this is a question I want to get to don't you think they sort of feel like well man if you could just stop talking about it if everyone could just stop talking about it then it would all just sort of go away like there's no way that's ever gonna happen right but there's almost like a subconscious in their mind where that sort of still somewhat what they think is like if we could all just go silent on this we can kind of starve it out sort of like do you think that's a that's a belief out there yeah it's a mix of things so I think I think there are some ways that I find myself sometimes and but I think this is particularly true of some people I know they intentionally well maybe not in and maybe they're not self aware about it but put it on a little bit heavier sharing this part of their story and expressing this part of their personality as a way of of telling that part of their self that it has value right as a way of pushing away shame about this part of their story as a way of of an a healthy way comforting themselves as a way of saying I'm not gonna hide or apologize for this part of my story or kind of pushing on others to create space for them to share this part of their story that makes it safe for others right I mean in some ways in in some ways that's what like gay pride month and gay pride parades are about it's it's about kind of in maybe in an aggressive way saying uh we're here and and we're gonna fight for our people and we're not going away and and and and and and if you're in this group you're loved and you're safe now and there's some things that I think are should we should understand like universally that are good about that right there's plenty of there's plenty of things that that uh I've not personally gone to a pride event yet uh there's lots of things that I probably see or or or or experience there that wouldn't be helpful for me right so but there's something good about the people saying to the wounded that in their tribe yeah you belong here I'm gonna keep you safe there's some exactly and it just it just occurs to me that because I also think there's something about a homosexuality discussing it in common cultural male circles you know you pick the age I guess call up between you know mid teens and to whenever you grow up which is never for a lot of people or something you know but like sure to my age I'm 36 where there's probably some other topics like this but you know it's sad that this is the true that this is true but I feel like in that age range of just average American Christian let's even say Christian male you bring up in an average circle where there's not someone because most of the time there's not someone in those circles that's present that is gay you're openly gay you bring up the issue of homosexuality that's the one topic you can bring up where you you're gonna get some like negative this role responses like some crude things are gonna be said and it's not good like sure this is not the way that this should be like like I I'm convicted myself of of this in the past and it's not that way with a lot of other things that could get brought up even simple things you know like let's you could even take pornography for example you bring up pornography in those same circles you don't tend to get the same sort of visceral like almost hateful and some sometimes like reaction yeah like I'm even just thinking like if you're at your average family get to get Thanksgiving or whatnot and it's a Christian family and someone brings up you know say out a gay pride you know parade or something like that gets brought up and if someone in the family's like has a sort of like thought that's you know like just kind of like evil that dirty or that's that's disgusting or that's like kind of really this would be like that'd be a good time to be like that's we don't need to talk a we don't need to talk about them like that you don't even know it's almost we there's this subconscious anyhow I'm ramming up there's something about this issue that causes a visceral reaction of people would you agree with that yeah and and you seem to suggest that like maybe that's even a little bit more common among men than women and and I think I think that might be true I mean at least what I experienced growing up was I think men more so than women feel this need to prove that they're not gay or to clarify if someone like sees to do or in close friendship and and makes a joke about them or if a guy dresses in ways that are a little different than their friends and someone makes a comment about that I one women don't police each other around that kind of stuff as much as men do and we can ask the question of why that is but but it seems like in in male friend groups there's more suspicion of hey are you gay or what are you doing what is that is that gay yeah and then there's more of a need to vary like in a strong way prove that you're not yeah right and one way you can prove that you're not is being cruel toward whatever gay is right um yeah and so I think that just I think and that becomes a cycle that feeds itself over and over again that and maybe that's part of this larger conversation about like masculinity and what is it what is healthy masculinity what is healthy biblical masculinity and and sometimes it is that a little extra and our do do we feel a need uh are there are there too many pressures for all of us to prove some extra muscular version of American masculinity uh in the church that that hurts us in a lot of ways not just in maybe more homophobia in some male Christian circles but so maybe some other things as well yeah so that's a whole lot bigger conversation so you're right that part of that is there's just this need to prove to themselves maybe know there's a clarify that they're not gay okay but I think it's I think a lot of times too it's more sinister than that like don't you think too there's this there's this misunderstanding of the gay couple or the gay person that that they're talking about um there's almost like they perceive a particular sort of if he depends on the circles that we're talking about here but I think it's with Somnay perceive a particular sort of San or evil yeah that almost like a yeah possession of some sort like a dirtiness there that they feel like they're choosing to sort of entertain and and involve themselves in and it's a particular sort of nasty as opposed to say like I don't know like a more air quotes innocent sin like theft or or murder or infidelity or something and there's a particular sort of dirtiness around and that's just that needs to stop because that's that's not that's not accurate you know I mean that's not biblical and I think that's the other reason why maybe some people are uncomfortable if I use the word gay to describe myself or if I were a t-shirt with a rainbow flag on it is I mean an element when I was growing up and I heard people use the word gay or homosexual I could tell from context clues they meant that word to mean a particular thing and what they meant that word to mean was gay people are these people who have group sex parties and they all do drugs and they're all drinking and all of them hate God right that was what when someone used the word gay it meant all of those things so it makes sense to me that if I'm speaking at a church and there is a meaningful number of people in that church that that's all they've known that word gay to mean and then I use that word to describe myself and then I say all the other things that we've said here already it's very confusing to them they're like what what the word gay means not just that you are attracted to people of the same sex but all this other stuff that I've been told to me right wait but now you're but you're saying these other things that contradict it so that's confusing so I think that's one of the reasons why maybe people wish that I would down not use that word and down play this part of my story is it's easy for them to conflate same sex attraction with all of the other things stories accurate or not that they associate with gay people yes okay that's accurate and and also it's something for your consideration possibly the reason this is causing such a visceral response and people is because it's not just about same sex attraction okay it's about all of like the things you mentioned the drugs and sex parties and all this type of thing but even part of that too is like a a turning your back on sort of the western way of society and doing life which is heterosexual family oriented that type of a thing and I want to get around to this with families too so we'll come back around to this but that is there is a certain sometimes it's hard to tell whether the idea comes from the church or whether it comes from society and I think in some of this and then I think sometimes actually ideas come from society creep into the church and then the church owns it and thinks that it came from the church all along when actually a idea came from society yeah and I think family is one of those things we need to touch on but sure but if and when that happens when it when it when it idea comes from western quote unquote Christian American society or culture culture and comes into the church and the church owns it when you poke at that thing you will get a visceral response unlike any other I mean I think we saw this in the last year with some of the political stuff going on it's like when on that sort of Christian right camp I mean there's I mean just to make it pretty practical there's plenty of people in that camp that can't fathom how you could be a Christian of vote for Biden let's just call it what it is like they're just they can't fathom it's like it's impossible like there's just you know and it creates sort of this energy this response this good versus evil this right versus wrong this this outrage when I poke that side and I think whatever that is I think the the the gay thing with those people it's poking at that thing sure it's almost like it's it's it's almost like it's true or to them or internalize more to them than even the gossip what's like it's like well we understand that some people believe the gossip on some people don't but you poke at that one part where it's like now you're poking at sort of the western American like ideal the way of doing life this so precious to us and we can't have that change and you will get a right dude you will get a crazy response which we saw on January the 6 one all these crazy storm the capital that's yeah I'm talking about this all kind of it's lumped together here I mean it's whatever that is this you will get a really really strong response yeah if you go back to that that transition we talked about earlier in our conversation from the 80s to now from assuming if the gay person wants to be straight enough God will make them straight to now an acceptance that for a vast majority of people that doesn't seem to be God's will to change their sexual orientation so go back to the 80s for a person who believed for the average straight Christian who had the assumption that well if a gay person wanted to be straight enough God would just make them straight well then it confirms that well then all the people out there who were gay just want to disobey and reject God exactly exactly exactly so it was that I think in many ways it was this inaccurate and many ways scientific assumption or or kind of that people if they just prayed hard enough or they just went to the right therapy they could become straight yes that's what made it easy to believe this to have the certain kind of uh ish towards gay people yes so I have to I have because they have no one to blame but themselves I'm I'm doing air quotes here yeah no one to blame but themselves because they could be normal if they wanted to yes but they're choosing not to be normal I mean I have to I think there was a point in my life where I believe that man sure like I I'm I have to confess that and I was young and stupid and didn't know a thing I didn't have any gay friends that I know of that rope been leaked gay but I I even feel like at one point I believe that you know like that you could change if you want it's just so why aren't you changing you don't you mean I want to touch on the family thing because I think that's important too yeah it's one of the things that I love so much about what you're doing with the Nashville family brothers is well and you touched on this and the Christianity today article it's it's just that that is a biblical choosing to live a celibate life for God's glory and to do his work I mean my goodness it's it's called out explicitly in the new testament I mean there's things that are called out way more implicitly that people like really like build their lives around even more than this but this is clearly it's a biblical category okay but it's a very unpopular one and there are just so you know if you don't already there are people that the nuclear family is God man sure you probably already know that but there are people that's like you don't mess with their family you know what I mean now husband wife and their kids like that's what it's all about the church can't mess with that society can't mess with that um heck sometimes they even bring their kids home and school them at home because they don't want in it and there's most homeschoolers probably that's not the case because there's lots of great great homeschoolers out there but there's people that take that nuclear family so seriously and make that the center of their life yeah and that's wrong you know because there there is it is possible to make the family the center of your life and not God sure and any time God is not the center of your life it's super wrong and and and and that belief system doesn't leave a lot of room for the single like they might be like yeah sort of you know maybe you know like like they would I think a lot of them would the Christian ones would be like yeah they understand the single misses but I also feel like they think it's some people like they take the nuclear family that seriously would think it's like the single life is still somehow so far sure and that also needs to go right because I think that was also something left over from the 90s yeah because we're not talking about like option A and if that doesn't work out then we go to option B right we're talking about following God option A it's just two different ways of following God right yeah so I think two things there first to the to the person kind of in the nuclear family where they are particular focus is is just our nuclear family build walls around this keep everything in I I understand what some of the pressures are for for why people feel the need to do that but I also know a lot of people who have done that and they found themselves lonely right and that's not because that husband or that wife there's anything wrong with their their spouses any more broken than the average human right it's because we're all made for relationship of more than just one person and God right and so I think I'd encourage that I think even those nuclear families were kind of isolated would discover that their marriage will be healthier when they have healthy friendships with other people in the body of Christ so that's my that's my little push on them but I also want to recognize that one of their one of their fears and I think the fear of some people who hear me talk about singleness is oh you're talking about more singleness and less marriage you're you're pushing Peter we we're afraid that you're pushing more guys in their 20s avoiding getting married just using hook up apps and then playing video games and less people getting married that's what they are afraid of that I am encouraging and that's not what I'm encouraging right I'm actually encouraging more Christian marriage and more singleness for the sake of the kingdom and I think the problem is for a lot of those people they they only kind of think of two categories they think of single and Christian dark single and married excuse me yeah and I want to tease that out actually into three categories married um committed to singleness for the Lord and then the singleness we're all born into because I think that helps tease us out more yes I would agree we have too many people who are still stuck in the singleness that we're born into uh agreed and and let's go point I was ready for this body it's pretty special I was really ready straight but when it landed it landed pretty hard you totally right about that yeah so we have you know with too many people you know and I'll call this like temporary singleness okay we have too many people kind of and and I think some like social commentary people call this like prolonged adolescence right we have too many people in in temporary singleness that's lasted longer than it's supposed to and haven't either settled down into singleness for the Lord or settled down into Christian marriage what I'm encouraging and particularly in this Christianity today article it's for every Christian young adult to discern with God to ask God do you want me to settle down into singleness for the Lord really use all my extra time and energy to do more kingdom work um not to not to play more video games and find more people and hook up apps right or God do you want me to settle down into Christian marriage and serve the kingdom in that way and so it tends to be when I make this clarification and I say hey I don't want less marriage I actually want more marriage than we've got our churches and I want more people settling down into singleness for the sake of the kingdom I don't think these things compete yeah I actually think if there's more marriage and more commitment to singleness for the sake of the kingdom in our churches it will it will make both healthier yeah it'll be good for the church and good for both parties yep I that's just so well said man I I couldn't agree more couldn't agree more and I mean I just have to I won't keep poking at the nuclear family is ultimate more it's just it needs to be poked at because for whatever reason that is more acceptable in mainstream evangelical Christian communities then it is to to live a a solid bit lifestyle and be single and it's like we have to admit at some point here we have to face the fact that it's really easy to elevate your family and what your goals for your family to ultimate levels and that needs to stop like that's that's sin too you know I mean it's you I mean you have a steward you have a particular steward ship from responsibilities parents and and so you have that and that's from God and that's well and good and it's why there's parents and that's God's creative design and everything but there is something about parenting that can be really easy to make it ultimate and you or just you know you would do anything to protect your family and keep others away and keep sin out when the Bible sanks the worst sin is in our hearts I can't keep it at your household it's in your kids hearts are ready trust me you know so anyhow yeah all right we touched on the family thing I want to make sure we touched on that we're sure we go from here we should hear probably about your story at some point too right yeah let's hear about I want to hear about your story yeah were you grew up in all that how you were gay and what age and yeah steps things so grew up in East Tennessee in Kingsport Tennessee in the Tri-Cities and grew up in like a pretty typical Christian home I've got a little brother mom and dad and we did grow up going to an Episcopal Church okay and then I I've kind of been everywhere in between then I we went to a we were doing a Episcopal Church and then when a lot of people left the Episcopal Church we went to a Catholic Church for two years and then we landed at the Methodist Church and I went to a Southern Baptist but and reformed summer camp and then in college I went to a PCA Church and then I went to a like kind of more progressive Church of Christ Church while attending a campus ministry in college that was also reformed Baptist so I'm not a little bit of everything you have but but I've returned to Anglicanism more broadly over the past six years and and I've been pleasantly surprised by what was familiar and what I kind of appreciated more now because I've been in other spaces and for so many years in between how how did you how did you handle the internal knowledge that you were gay when did you start to sense that and and how did all that play all yeah so I'm gonna grew up in in a in a in a culture and in a church where well I don't know a church but in a in a family and in a city where like I knew at least the short line God's against homosexuality right like that I knew that I knew that that's what I was supposed to believe or that's what the Bible supposedly said and so yeah and sixth grade when I realized that I was attracted to other guys I mean at first I tried to ignore it and then and then I tried to make deals with God right okay God what if I get like straight days for the next six months will you take this away what if I obey what my parents like what they asked me to do like without question no protest will you take this away if I don't play video games for six months will you take this away right I tried to make these deals with God because I just I knew my life would be easier if this wasn't something I had to manage makes sense of and anyway over and over again I held up my part of the bargain and God didn't hold events yeah yeah I mean he never agreed to the bargain so to be fair to be fair to be how are you at this point sixth grade I'm always bad with correlating age six grades so 12ish 11 to 12 that sounds about right yeah is that the kind of the beginning of when you started to notice this okay so about 12 yeah and it's just like it's just where you would maybe look at another boy the way that another 12 year old might look at another 12 year old girl like that sort of like those feelings is that sort of yeah how you could tell one of the ways that I've heard other people describe it that like some fits for me is if they'd hear other guys describing what they find attractive in girls I wouldn't I wouldn't notice that or that wouldn't register for me but but then over time I would notice but I am noticing those things and other guys I am I am lingering and and kind of curious in ways about other guys that my guy friends seem to be about other girls I see yeah that's a good way to put it yeah and how do you how do you think about that like God created mankind he created a snail and female like those are the two options male and female and the creative design was for male to be attracted to female and female to be attracted to male I think so and yet there's all kinds of sin out there in ways that we've messed it up and just and and would you say like one of those like hundreds right or thousands of you know but but one of those ways or outcomes of sin is that let that some people become or are just always worse as far as they know like just attracted to the same sex like is that how do you like how do you think through that how you rationalize right yeah so I kind of I talk about it as a as a brokenness I think it's a helpful way for me to talk about it and yeah so I don't think God we've got for this imagined me and imagined me being born into a perfect world I don't think he imagined me experiencing same sex attraction but I did develop same sex attraction and God and God didn't stop that from happening and and I that happened probably through some mix of genetic predisposition and some kind of environmental factors in my family and whatever I don't think I had any part in choosing that or making that happen I don't I don't think there's any of a blame up of that on me and often people ask me well if if this isn't what God intended and yet and he didn't stop it from happening and he doesn't answer your prayers to to remove it that doesn't sound like a good god like how could that be how this works and at least for me from like my theological background we're asking really a question about free will free process consequences of our decisions and God's goodness and how does that all work out right and my only explanation is you know whether it's genetic predisposition or the stuff that I experienced in my home growing up whatever it was that contributed to and we could see genetic predisposition even as a form of like generational sin some people see that is like a manifestation of generational sin so my understanding is I developed same sex attraction because of the sins and the brokenness of other people that impacted me at a genetic level at an emotional level right could God have swooped in and protected me from those consequences of other people's decisions yes but if our choices don't have consequences do we really have choice right and so one of the ways that God God believes it it's more good to allow us choice and to allow the consequences of our wrong choices to play out in ways that cause us pain but then us how the capacity to choose to love him then to take choice away from us but keep us safe that that's it's a it's a greater good right so that's how I understand why do I why did God why did why did God not keep me protect me from developing same sex attraction why has God not taking this away well because God believes that the greater good is for us to meet a truly have choice and others to truly have choice and more often than not what that means is for God to allow the consequences of our decisions to play out even in ways that hurt us yeah and hurt others yeah and even the choice thing I and I agree with what you're saying and then also too I mean you said it earlier you don't you don't think you would have the same Peter Volk today if you didn't deal with this right yeah it's hard to imagine it's hard to imagine yeah I mean there are things that have been in my life that were extremely difficult and it's hard to imagine the same can't laps it in here without those things having happened and so and what I trade the outcome and the the depth and character like that you have developed for dealing with those things I mean and then you got to say well then some people say well sure but like God could have still made you the the same person you were without having dealt with that but the problem with that is now you're putting yourself in the place of God because you know in God's providence you did deal with what you dealt with or you did go through the pain you went with went through whatever that happens to be the difficulty in life because we all have it and and like he is working you know in all things that's somehow working for the good in you and it's developing a unique a uniquely godly strong you with a certain depth the character that you wouldn't have if you went through those things and if you want to say well sure there's a way that God could give you those things without having gone through that well of course but now you're making yourself you're putting yourself in God's seat now right yeah it's it's the yeah there's only one reality there's only one universe that we love so it's yeah it's it's only kind of a mental exercise that try to imagine other things but it doesn't do as much good yeah yeah this is the this is the story I have this is the yeah the world we live in and and for yeah for me what's been more helpful has been focusing not on I've made peace with the question of God why did you not stop this why did you not change this right for me I'm encouraging myself to focus on how is God redeeming this from my good in his glory how is God using this for good how can I lean into that what is my part of play how does God want to collaborate with me to to make good of broken circumstances for also to like if you're and there's something about people's sexuality where if you're asking even a Christian like there's a lot of people that would believe in God that if you would say and yes if you are same sex attracted then that's fine you don't need to you don't need to try to change yourself but you also you also pergas design wouldn't get married and have like wouldn't get married to someone who would same so it's married to the same sex and have a sexual relationship then there's something about our sexuality that we hold pretty high and or have a tendency to be unwilling to hear that right yeah I mean but because it feels like oh but it we just it's our right need yeah we have a right that we just need romance and sex how could you that's just cruel right and and I think the problem there is is the assumption that we need romance or sex to be whole people but we do don't we I don't think so yeah I agree I mean at least we see examples of Jesus and Paul and many of the early church mothers and fathers many of them were a celibate and and I don't I don't think that was because they had like a heroic I mean Jesus had a heroically different faith than I did obviously but I you know I think the the differences of the between Paul and early church mothers and fathers and me and other cell that people today I think the differences in our faithfulness is maybe maybe marginal I don't know I don't really know but I guess what I'm trying to say is like these are normal people and so yeah I don't think and I would push against maybe like a psychological theorist who would say that we have a need for sex and romance we have a need yeah for spiritual intimacy for healthy physical intimacy for emotional intimacy for intellectual intimacy and each of those you know if you think of him as like buckets that need to be filled each day those can be filled with some of those can be filled with romance in sex but none of those four buckets require romance or sex and there is a healthy emotional intimacy and physical intimacy and spiritual intimacy and intellectual intimacy I can enjoy in meaningful friendship and and we actually have a model for that in scripture we see the the deep friendship of David and Jonathan the deep friendship of Jesus and John the deep friendship of Ruth and Naomi the deep friendship of Paul and Timothy those were romantic or sexual relationships but they were deep satisfying spiritual friendships and so but but the other thing I want to say is I think the reason why we think we need those is so many of the stories we grew up hearing and we see on Disney channel tell us that we need romance to be whole right yes I think the the idol and you earlier were kind of pointing out maybe some of the ways that we idolize the nuclear family in the church maybe idolize marriage I think there's probably there's some truths to that what I think maybe is a more accurate place to focus the the spotlight is romance the idol of romance I think in many ways that's the problem and I think it hurts married people too yeah right because part of this lie of the idol of romance is if you just found the person that was the one the right one this would be easy oh is this not easy and must be because they're not the one is it more magical it must be because they're not the one or maybe the problem is because maybe the real problem is that what we see in Disney channel and movie theaters about romance is a lie yes that real love isn't that magically easy it's built and sustained it's it's not it's not magic yes that is such a key point and so if we find herself yeah always talking about from a young age with your daughters like three, four years old like just in becoming in fact with who they're gonna marry and what what characteristics you want in your future spouse like that was a big thing back in the 90s when I was a kid's like right down what you want in your spouse and you know have all this thing figured out and like put thought into and pre-planning into it I mean some of it's fine and so it's just like stop it yes you know what I mean just some eleven year old girls already have their like wedding Pinterest boards done exactly yes and that's the case and not every time that that happens you would say you know you would say well that's definitely idolatry because that's the thing with actions like you can't tell the motivations you know rarely can you really tell someone's motivations however it would be reason for pause sure you know what I mean it's reason for pause if like if that is happening or the parents are constantly talking about who their kids are gonna marry like those are just ways you subtly reinforce this idolatry of romance I'm glad you touched on that yeah there's a great book by guy named Cutter Callaway who's a works at some some a seminary I think followers seminary out in California called breaking the marriage idol and I'm friends with Cutter and he's actually said himself that he he didn't want to name the book that way because because it makes it sound like it's attacking marriage and that's not actually what the content of the book is like I he would probably he would like if he could rename the book he would call it breaking the romance idol and it's a great book and the whole first half it's really talking about uh in secular culture what are the stories about romance and that we need romance needs sex to be whole people and what are some ways that the Christianity in America has not resisted that and has has incarcerated that ourselves in in in in some different kind of movements purity movements and some different messaging around what who real women and women are so so there's a really interesting conversation in there about Disney and about Taylor Swift and about the bachelor and the bachelor and the bachelor and then about a true love weights and I kissed dating goodbye and maybe kind of a a a John and Stacy Eldridge version of what real men women are he says a conversation about all of that that is really interesting and really a tease is out how romance has become an idol in America and in church yeah dude it really has man and I mean look and people like someone might be listening to think of a dude, Kent's no fan of marriage no dude I would be lost without my wife I'll just be honest you know what I mean I there all evidence would indicate I was not one of those guys it was supposed to live a solid but lifestyle you know like to meeting Mary and having that marriage and that relationship is like it's I mean it's probably the biggest joy of my life you know what I mean like it would be pointless without a creator guide and a redeemer in Jesus Christ obviously um huge fan I just not a fan of you know being infatuated by it and and and and that being the way that your life needs to go and thinking a ton about it from a young age and pre-planning and I mean I feel like you're just setting yourself up for heartache if at the very least you know the idolatry aspect aside you're just setting yourself up for heartache yeah so yeah someone asked me the other day uh if if like 90% of Christians are supposed to get married and maybe like 5 or 10% are supposed to do this singleness for the sake of the kingdom right okay the odds of getting married are pretty good you know so why not just everyone assume we're gonna get married you know the 90% odds like I go gamble with those odds yep um but I think the problem with assuming that marriage is gonna be what got has for us right and and talking to our kids with that assumption is for the 90% who do get married or her a meant for marriage um they take it for granted right we don't see it as a gift that God has given we don't see it as a commission the God has given us yeah um we don't own it we don't we don't really take full responsibility for it yeah and then for the 10% who assumed marriage was for them and it's not what God has for them they feel cheated um so I think everyone has to be in a sense benefit from you know teaching our kids and teens and young adults not to assume marriage but instead kind of with open handed with open hands going into God and saying I want to learn how both of these options could be good for me and could you tell me which one will be better for me and then I'll step into that one not because I'm just gonna I'm unthinkingly taking it but because I'm convinced that that that's what God's best is particularly for me yes um and I'm gonna be thankful for that gift yes what I love about that so much too is it puts Christ at the center or or it puts another way think about it is it puts God above all else like it puts the comedy nominated there is your following God whether that's gonna be through marriage or whether that's gonna be through singleness and if we're not careful if you don't think about that way you're starting a position of romance and marriage sort of as a God in that society so um I also want to ask you you had mentioned there was you had dated some girls at some point and it sounded like kind of like if you really had to even as a believer you could have married one of them and sort of like made that work ish is that accurate yeah so um so I turned that might be helpful here is a mixed orientation marriage is the term that are kind of used in these conversations to describe an opposite sex marriage where one of the individuals experiences same sex attraction okay um and and those those are not like super common but but they exist in every church and probably in your church there's some of those in my church um and some of those couples share that part of their their story and some of them don't um so yeah that that mixed orientation marriage was up what have been a possibility for me uh in those dating relationships with those girls uh in the the physical intimacy that we did share like uh I knew that the marriage could work for us uh in the the ways that I felt towards those those women I knew that like I actually for for one of them I actually did come to love her in a way that was really robust um so it was never gonna be exactly the same as maybe some of my uh my straight guy friends and their marriages but uh I'm not gonna say it's it's it's challenging in different ways right so um one of the things that was true in my dating relationships with these women is um like a a lustful desire for them and to enjoy physical intimacy with them and and and and for talking in a lustful way really use this them and and as an object for my pleasure wasn't really present okay and and that was a really good thing right uh she knew that when I she knew that like rarely ever or my vote at more my motivations because I was like trying to get her to have sex with me she knew that yeah so you're open with her yeah well well yeah I was open but I mean in a positive way she knew that I was not some like her dog trying to yeah take advantage of her right and she knew that I didn't have mixed motives she knew that like if if I was when I if I was if I was if I was doing her a favor or I was saying sweet things or I was taking her on a date she like she knew that this is because he actually likes me and because he wants to communicate affection to me and but because he values me not just for what he could get from and with my body yeah but other things as well right yeah so I think so the I think the challenges of a mixed orientation marriage are probably obvious to people but I think there's also some unique blessings um in that from the very beginning like puppy love is not what fueled it it was an intentional investment like I I think this is someone I could go on mission with for God and we're gonna build this kind of sober love together this is really yeah about that and so the next orientation marriage is I know that they shared about this part of their story early in their dating relationship that they continue to talk about this honestly in their marriage that they shared this part of their story their couple story with at least some other couples and our inner inner and our kind of really honest about this and seeking the help and the support they need are some of the most beautiful marriages I know because early in their dating relationship they had to have this honesty this communication and the foundation of the relationship is a little bit something different again still recognizing the challenges the ways it's different um that's not for everyone but I do think you know hey what we're talking about here is me like challenging every straight person to really discern with God am I called to Christian marriage yeah or singleness for the sake of the kingdom in the same way I want to challenge every gay Christian committed to a traditional sexual ethic to at some level discern with God am I called to Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex or singleness for the sake of the kingdom yeah it's only fair yeah I'm gonna ask that of everybody yep yep and if you had gotten married and had a mixed orientation marriage is that is it the turning head for that's that's a new turn I hadn't heard of that because I wanted just as you were talking I wanted to bring it up because I was gonna say I'm gonna have to think there's some people that got married then realize maybe later or they maybe they knew it when they got married but for whatever reason they still got married and had same sex attraction right that has to be out there you just said that it is yeah yep so like in those cases like if I guess let's not say those cases but in your case like what if that had turned out like would that have relationship just been marked with a lot less sex you think or not necessarily or like is it more of a partnership or is it still it can still be a fully functioning loving marriage it's just that particular marriage deals with a particular thing like every marriage does but maybe not that particular thing yeah I mean from from the healthy physical intimacy that we enjoyed in our dating relationship I had every reason to believe that we would enjoy like full marital intimacy um now in the first couple of years would we have had sex as frequently as maybe some of my like straight friends and their typical marriages did maybe maybe not I don't know right but my hunch is by like year five or ten in the marriage the marriage is probably what it looks pretty similar in terms of frequency of of that um yeah we can get into a trickier conversation about um I think if um if every one of my straight guy friends who are married before considering having sex with their wife asked themselves am I am I am I am I am I is taking stepping forward with this because I want to communicate my love for my wife to her um or because I want to use her as a tool for my pleasure um I wonder how less frequently they would have sex yeah yeah so I yeah I don't know what it would have been exactly for me and how that would have compared to other marriages but um more sex isn't always better yeah yeah I mean it's talking about a such a strong and mysterious motivator sure and usually it's a big they'd be clear I don't think everything like 100% one zero percent the other yeah I'm sure those motivators I just listed it's just it just strikes me now is like what we're talking main goodness we're talking about like same sex attraction and marriage and a lot like I'm talking about every sexuality is such a it's such a strong and mysterious motivator you know it's like man um yeah there's there's just a there's an element of mystery to it that's probably always just gonna share there yeah but for whatever reason this is how God designed us um anything else you want to touch on your story hmm well had your parents take it um yeah I think when I first shared with them which was like sophomore year of high school they didn't really know how to help me any more than I knew how to help myself that's all share with a sophomore year of high school you mentioned the five year thing yeah okay but but they told me they love me okay and they told me they would they would help me however they could oh that's good and um and yeah now my my my parents are like a big supporters of of the work I do really my dad helps run a quips email account oh really like general information email cool and they share your your general theological points then yeah yeah okay so they're they're really supportive um I think some other big highlights are you know in college I really started sharing this part of my story with the Christian community that I was in more and and started doing life with other guys who were gay and Christian and committed to a traditional sexual ethic and and I realized that all of us one were afraid that following the bible's teachings would mean we would be alone and none of us had parents or pastors who knew how to care for us well and so in many ways like that was the beginnings of all of like the work I've been doing in the like the last decade of my life um a quip is an attempt to provide parents and pastors with the understanding and skills that they need to better love gay people like me and the national family of brothers is an attempt to offer family to gay and straight people who feel called to singleness for the sake of the kingdom um so a lot of that identifying that need and starting to think about what are the best solutions to this problem where we're in college um and yeah so a lot of this is the long time in the making or at least a decade in the middle yeah that's what I love so much about the work that you're doing is because it gives me hope that that um you know in one of these churches that you're involved with or in any sort of random church as you start to enact change that you know that that 12 year old boy realizes that he is gay and it doesn't he doesn't seem like it's gonna change anytime soon and he grows up in a church that does then understand and knows better how to deal with him and doesn't try to make you know and shows him the love of Christ and just reacts in a more positive beneficial encouraging uplifting gospel oriented way and less of the shame and turning your back and that you must change to stay in this family or the church like less of that and more of the good stuff like yeah you know it it's gonna happen I mean it's not gonna happen overnight but this is a good start you know missions like what you're doing organizations like what you're doing more of them it's gonna have it's gonna have an impact yeah so that I love it on equips website it's equip your community.org that's your organization you had I think a blog post about September 20th 2018 saying I'm gay you were just saying as as we planned for equips 2018 event why come out I was you were reminded that you'd never come out so you write this blog post which was really good by the way so if someone Googles I'm gay any quick your community.org that probably find your blog post but there was one paragraph in here that yeah I am most ashamed of these moments where my fear of being outed and discussed of my homosexuality turned to homophobia that hurt others I'm haunted by a scene from high school cross country Derek was the only openly gay guy in our school when he was on the team as we waited for the starting line for race to begin everyone paired up for partner stretching but one by one is Derek asked the other guys to help him stretch he was turned away with no gross I don't want to touch you and I don't want you touching me then he got to me and I sheepously refused I dished out the same pain I had spent tears and prayers to soothe that has to cut like a knife like how does that to be that person to be Derek and not have you know anyone be willing to help you stretch and what is that feel like and what kind of damage does that do it's lucky I'm sure it's awful yeah how does someone like deal with that I mean of all the things to deal with in life like to be Derek and deal with that like you just try to ignore it you try to forget about it I mean that's man that is that's hard yeah I mean I I can imagine if his if his story is any similar to mine you you hope for a while that it'll just go away and and then and then eventually you try to find places where you can be you and will be loved and I guess that's why I'm hoping some of our churches could become a place where I could still where kids where eight year olds where 12 year olds could share this part of their story and they know they could still be loved or they're not scared to share this part of their story and they could still find God's love and God's wisdom for them because yeah that that when someone doesn't have anywhere to go that's that's why we see the higher rates of of depression and suicidality particularly among gate teenagers on LGBT teens are five times more likely to attempt suicide kids who grew up in a highly rejecting families are gay teens who grew up in a high are in highly rejecting families or eight times more likely to attempt suicide than their than the average gay teen right so even even the response of a family to when they first share matters a lot and and there's I can't remember the exact number but something like um gay teens who grew up in in families where religion is important are like 30% more likely to attempt suicide so so unfortunately depression and suicide feels like a better option then continuing to walk into that high school every day and feel unwell com and and be told I don't who grows I don't want you touching me and I don't want to touch you go away and that's that's really sad it sucks have you experienced rejection like that at times usually you need more from strangers and if I'm around some other guys who maybe present a little bit more flamboyingly than I do but where they might like reject the group yeah we're kind of just like yell a slur or something from a distance so uh but I mean I'm thankful that I mean my story wasn't Derek story and some ways because I didn't come out if I had come out and if I'd shared my story fully in high school I would have been met by the same things he he was he had when I started sharing my story for the first time in college and the Christian communities that I was and I was loved really well but I also know that like when I share with my Christian community it was with the clear caveat and don't worry I still believe in a traditional sexual ethic and I'm not going to go pursue a relationship with the guy I don't know how those spaces would have reacted if I if I if I would have if I would have shared something different sure I don't know if I would have received the same love and yeah yeah do you experience rejection today like with some of the probably not the churches that you're talking to because they're coming to you probably for the most part but the society reject you today occasionally yeah just by the nature of like though the work I do and the people I live around and the people in my church I tend to be around people who are not who love me well I'm thankful for that I know there are so plenty of spaces in America and plenty of churches in America where that wouldn't be the case but I'm really blessed to have spaces where where I feel safe but but there are times when kind of maybe a quick was working with churches that are a more different than the church I go to yeah where where I hear things that are painful to hear I hear the ways that they talk about gay people and and you know it's again in contrast to maybe some of the like the physical harm that gay people experienced in the 70s in the 80s and the 90s what I'm about to share after this seems like a small thing right and I think that's a credit to how America has changed in some positive ways but even like we talked earlier about this disagree even about what word I use right where they call myself a gay Christian or call myself a Christian who experiences same sex attraction it's just words right it's not a big deal but but recently the denomination I'm in released a a document statement that at least it kind of national level events and communication requires me to forbid me from calling myself gay or calling myself a gay Christian and only allows me to call myself a Christian who experiences same sex attraction admittedly it's a small thing right they're not putting a rope around my foot and like dragging me behind a pickup truck right like if this is this is small potatoes compared to what gay people had to put up with in the 80s you know in the 70s but it does hurt because it's just another who I have to jump through to prove that I'm a good enough Christian for them and that does hurt and and again it's a small thing it's not I'm not trying to like way way I'm a victim I have the hardest life over here yeah you know but it is a small thing and and and you know for me okay fine I can follow their requests I think what's harder is yes for teenager that goes to my church who is in a church that teaches the traditional sexual ethic hopefully in compassionate ways maybe they're in a family that teaches that in a more culturally conservative way maybe there's a little bit of homophobia among their peers and and they already are having to deal with this all of these messages that that we need romance we need sex and their face with this dilemma will God God God does God has not changed this part of my story does God even love me to honor God and make him happy will have to give up these things that the world says is most good for me okay there's plenty of burdens and just being a normal teenager in America also other challenges okay layer onto that that we're now going to police what words he can use to describe himself it's it's it's it's it's it's the fact that it's it's it's it's it's it's the straw on top of a big big stack of heavy plates yeah and at some point it just becomes too much and so that's why it's again it's a small thing but but that's the kind of stuff that that I experience that that kind of rubbs me the wrong way sure no I'm glad to share that how can the average person listening to this the average married person the average family member of well well let's say the average mom or dad listening to this who you know their straight married to have their family how can they help yeah like this this national family of brothers I mean that's sort of like by the way are you willing to share like what part of town it is we live in like the fifth TSU area north Nashville okay got you cool yeah super intriguing to me like I'm just thinking do you guys need a meal at some point you know what I mean like how how can how can the average person listening to this help okay well I think if they if parents were to do anything I think the first is what made them make sure that they've had these conversations with their kids um if you go to we've got of the some free resources on equipped website if you go to equip your community dot org for it's slash blog and you scroll that and you find there's a series of blocks called conference parent conversation starters oh cool and we got eight like free guides for parents to start conversation lead conversation with their kids about these a lot of these different topics one of them particular um you know how do we how do we share about the reality that there are gay people in the world and make sure our kids know that the the god has the god loves gay people and he has a wisdom for gay people um if if if any parents listening make sure they've had that conversation with their kids and um you know six seven eight is not too early to have these conversations in careful ways and in those parent conversation guides it has age appropriate ways to leave those conversations so it says how could you know because we've got two three four five year olds who are noticing in YouTube videos that they're watching and noticing when they're out on the streets gay people and rainbow flags and are asking questions so yeah you know you you've got opportunities to to have these conversations in careful ways and lead your kids to think and theologically accurate ways about sexual stewardship so so that me and I first encourage my parents to do that um but then more kind of focused on this conversation about discernment vocational singleness the Nashville family of brothers um i'd encourage parents in the language they use with their kids not to presume marriage not when you get married but if and to offer early both of these possibilities of Christian marriage or singleness for the Lord recognizing that ones more common than the other but kind of setting up this expectation of hey both are good they are different um let's let's explore what scripture has to say about both of those let's let's make sure there are people in our family's life in both of those stories let's make sure there are some celibate people there's some single people excuse me i had to burp let's make sure there's some single people leveraging their singleness for the sake of the kingdom who are in our kids life so they can see that that could be good too and let's set up this expectation that hey once you get into your later teen years and your young adult years you you'll get to ask God that question you'll get to ask on hey god do you have a preference for me which which might be better for me um and we're going to be excited for you to ask God that question yeah those kind of conversations set up that expectation with our kids um i think that's another great thing the parents can do okay parenting aside is is it good for couples to invite their celibate single friends over to their houses much as possible holidays in particular is there other ways that we can have a more congruent healthy society particularly at kind of the church community level yeah i think so so one of the ways that we that i that we talk about this at a quick is kind of our our inner circle of the body of Christ and for the people who are married it's probably obvious that they're spouse and their kids are in that inner circle of the body of Christ and what i want to encourage uh kind of nuclear families to do is to add a couple of unrelated single people to that inner circle in the body of Christ and so it's so while i'm also talking about consistency here right consistently invite the same people walking out singleness for the to meals with you and to do some holidays with you and different things so they feel like they're part of like this extended family we see yeah we're off look at that but i can see the reason you know and and to encourage people to do that well we're not off of that because of covid we're off of that because it's just not on a radar so i'm definitely um one of the ways i've seen you know i'm in a tradition where they do godparents they do infant baptism in godparents i think particularly choose celibate people to be your kids godparents yeah it's a way of kind of knitting single people into your family's life and into your kids life yes yeah i love that what else do you want to talk about Peter i don't know i think we covered a fair bit i just want to make sure um oh we have to touch on this briefly before let you go can you brief it describe and i don't know if this was your kind of categories but like side a b and x can you touch on that just a little bit please yeah where that came from because i thought i found that helpful too yeah so a lot of times when we talk about uh sexual ethics theological beliefs when it and with LGBT topics people use the word uh you know biblical or not biblical um liberal or conservative progressive or traditional affirming or non affirming orthodox or unorthodox right so what's what's what's in common with all these right there they're their pairs of words they're like oppositional and they're usually loaded words right like even with the word we use we're kind of signaling what the right choice is yeah we love that man it's what the society is built on we're good and a bad and a right and a wrong we love controversy in the United States of America yes we do and uh do people get caught in the crossfire they get the front of the fire yeah so um so so i want to offer a or some people before me have offered a different way to kind of frame or kind of kind of describe different theological camps and also recognize there's actually there's more than just two ways to think about this so um an organization called the gay Christian network um now that's now renamed themselves as the queer Christian fellowship um which is not an organization that I'm like particularly involved in but they did popularize this side a side b side x language so first we've got like three options and side a side b side x they like at least at like face value they're kind of value neutral like it's not clear which is better than the other I mean maybe side a is like option a or something maybe it seems better but for you know less loaded than liberal conservative right or affirming non-affirming okay um so this describes three different like three of theological camps in this conversation so side a um is uh is what i might was like what you would think of as a progressive sexual ethic or uh or a gay affirming theology it's a belief that god would bless an opposite sex marriage in the same way as the he blesses excuse me side a is a belief that god would bless a same sex marriage in the same ways that he blesses opposite sex marriages right and that god made people gay intended for them to be gay and i just know it's no less no no no no no less broken than than heterosexuality okay um side x uh we'll say on the because they they are kind of on a line a spectrum a and then b and then x so side x we'll go to the other end of the line is a belief that um if and it's named out for the x gay movement or pray the gay away um side x is a belief that if people uh pray hard enough god will make them straight um that that that continuing same sex attractions are a sign of lukewarm sanctification or or um or kind of a um a lack of of of of kind of sexual lack of of stewardship and and kind of trying hard enough um and and that everyone is supposed to be married to someone of the opposite sex um and that everything about gay culture and gay people and gayness is bad okay that's side x and then in the middle there's a middle cluster of belief called side b um and this is where i would find myself kind of this is what this is what describes what i believe and people who are in this space believe that same sex attraction is a result of the fall it's a brokenness it's not what god intended um and and god's best for all Christians is is Christian marriage will some of the opposite sex to raise kids or celibate singleness for the sake of the kingdom um but there's no formula for changing people's sexual orientations it happens very very infrequently so um and and god's what god's best for us is so god's best for us and we do even if we don't choose who we're attracted to and there's no formula for changing it we're still responsible for what we do for the actions we take how we respond to our actions and so even for gay people the best things for them is either Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex or celibate singleness for the sake of the kingdom yeah and and in this side kind of side b theological space there's also some recognition that hey maybe there's some some benefit to in some careful limited ways Christians who are gay recognizing that they're gay using that word to describe themselves finding some some some healthy connectedness to gay culture you know maybe maybe it's okay that when they see a gay character in a TV show doing harmless things that that makes them feel good because there's someone like me in this story maybe that's so maybe it's okay that they can listen to an artist that they know is gay um and enjoy the fact that all this person's like me so yeah so that's side a and side b and side x yeah thanks for sharing that i found it was very helpful you describe that very well i mean i feel like i mean you're you're already my brother in Christ but now i feel like you're my brother like in life like i've met you and and i've enjoyed meeting you and i want to be friends going forward yeah that would be fun yeah that'd be great and and i feel like i need to walk in the light a little bit with you because this is kind of a thing with where i go to a manual Nashville maybe i've ever visited yeah um and walking in light and being honest with each other like that's a key ingredient to the Christian life and i have to say in like speeches a big thing for me like i you know i i just can't stand when people talk negatively about other people behind their back you know i mean it's heart fair and like the whole gossip scene and passive aggressive stuff and how you talk about people like it really matters people deserve honor and respect and i don't care who you are or what you've done there's a certain amount of honor and respect that you're oh just from being a human being you know what i mean but um a few weeks ago we were hanging out with neighbors it was just the four of us and i don't know what i how we got on a topic or why we did we didn't stay there very long but the general premise of this got the very short discussion was i was just commenting how i sort of understand like women with but i don't understand like guys with guys sure and it's just like it strikes me now it's like that was completely unnecessary thing to say you know and like the other guys were to agree and then we just moved on and it's like that like this is what i've enjoyed about this is now that i've met you and we've had this discussion i would never be able to say that again with a clean conscience because it's like dude it doesn't matter if you get it or not it's some people's experience don't talk like that you know what i mean so i wish i hadn't said it i'm confessing that i did and and i'm glad that i've met you now because i'll be honest Peter like i don't think i've met i don't have i haven't had a conversation like this with another openly gay guy i don't think ever and so there's probably a lot of other people out there like this too and part of my hope with the podcasts is that if people listen to this and and they can hear your heart and your desire for Christ and your faithfulness to the Bible that sort of the same effect might be had on them too it's like once you sort of have that encounter with someone you have a friend with someone in a particular thing it doesn't really matter what it is but in this case like same sex attraction it changes how you like it's hard to have this sort of more of this us versus them and tell you whatever it is going forward like it changes how you should think about you know the the people deal with that so i just want to say that thank you for your time so i think it's past five one Friday night i should probably let you go but genuinely really appreciate your time this has been great getting to know you and i'd love to stay in touch going forward anything you want to say and closing before we're at this up hmm i mean sure one last thing i'll say is um well i'll just say i think for some people it's really hard to believe that that like singleness for the kingdom that cell of a sea is a good thing it's hard for them to recommend that to their kids or recommend that to a gay person they love because it it it seems like it's it's really second best i and you spoke to this a little earlier so one way that that some people might kind of have a have a reminder of the goodness of cell of a sea and and how good it could be is i really think this is not just a shameless plug for social media but it is in a way is the the social media account for the national family of brothers particularly like our instagram our facebook account um like follow us and come along the ride with us see the beautiful things that are happening in our house and our family and i hope that that gives you hope it's elbeseed actually is good for some people um and i'm going to be and by reading those stories and by kind of coming along this journey with us it's easier for people to to recommend like the singleness of Jesus and Paul to to people they love um so that'd be that'd be kind of a final thing to say is uh yeah follow us on instagram or or facebook and and i think you'll find the the stories to be really encouraging yep love it Peter Volk thanks for being on the podcast thank you appreciate it very much
