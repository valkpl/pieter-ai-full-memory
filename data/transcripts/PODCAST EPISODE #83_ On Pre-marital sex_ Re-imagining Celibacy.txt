 family unit was sort of the elevated unit in our churches. This is the the thing to which you aspire to get married and have children. And instead I think what Peter and Danny are saying is that singleness is something with dignity. It is something to which you can aspire. Hello and welcome to where do we go from here? I'm one of your highest just to get Amanda Wine God and I'm Debbie Abraham. Where do we go from here on Tangle 6, South and community for a new generation of Christians? Leave behind purity culture and save what matters. To get that, let's rebuild life and faith with Jesus at the center and figure out where will you go from here. You can find out more on our website where do we go pod.com and join the conversation on Instagram and Twitter at where do we go pod? You can also watch our episodes on YouTube via the link in the show notes. Yes and today we are talking to Peter Volk and Danny Trouque to reimagine celebrity. But before we do that, did you know you can invest in this podcast by becoming a partner at where do we go pod? .com forward slash partner. For three dollars a month you can support what we do here and get episodes of the Jess and Debbie show. This week we've got a section of our interview with Peter and Danny that no one else gets to hear except for our partners and don't forget that in October this month we are really trying to increase our partners so that we can build a new website for where do we go from here. So if you are thinking about joining, if you've been thinking about joining, maybe this is the month to do that, where do we go pod.com forward slash partner? All right, let's get into our show. Okay Jess, we have done one episode on premarital sex last month. We talked to the science Roberts. It looked at a more progressive view of what moving on from purity culture can look like. So today we're looking at the other side, another angle. Yeah we're looking at celibacy today and what we've been learning in hearing from you, you are listeners and just in the research we've been doing that there's a real distinction between the seems to be a distinction between celibacy and abstinence. So those two terms that some people have used interchangeably that for people who are practicing those things a lot of the time you see a real distinction between them. Yeah so celibacy being this idea of a vocational calling or an idea that it's sort of life long. And abstinence being I'm single I hope to one day be married and I'm abstaining from having sex. It's interesting though because for me I would say the word abstinence is so tainted because of the true love weights movement and purity culture and this sort of abstinence only sex education. For me it comes with a lot of baggage so I much prefer the term celibacy personally and I thought of my own self as celibate when I was single but it's really helpful I think it can be helpful to draw a distinction for people as well to say there is a difference between the two. Yeah I mean I hope I'm not offending anyone when I say this I feel like Debbie if you wanted to say the word celibate when you're a single person that's fine and yeah people should be able to choose what word they prefer. Yeah but as long as I guess for others that there's kind of an understanding that for some people they were very distinct parameters around these words and for other people they might be used a little bit more fluid but for today's episode we are talking around more of that idea of either a long term or a lifetime commitment. Yes it's we're looking more at the long term lifetime and we've decided to add another episode next month where we'll be talking about more of the idea of abstinence and bringing you people who are dating or engaged or people who have had sex in the past but are now choosing not to. So we hope that those three episodes will give you kind of a 360 angle on the primarital sex conversation. Yes and then we'll do a fourth episode because we just love this so much and we're gonna actually debrief everything and all of our three episodes on progressive sexual ethics on a celibacy and then on abstinence and what we're inviting you all to participate in is a survey and we wanted to make this survey entirely anonymous so we're not doing it through Instagram or Twitter or through our website we're gonna have a link in the show notes to an online survey to just get your responses in and around this topic of pre-marital sex totally anonymously and we would love to be able to kind of canvas a demographic the demographic that listens to this podcast yep not for any purpose other than just just being honest with with where people at whatever of that is we have no idea what's gonna come out of that Debbie but we would just really like to yeah to to be able to talk about this stuff and kind of summarize this whole discussion for you and hopefully synthesize some of this stuff about where are you going from here with this question and pre-marital sex. That's right. So let's get into our show with our first guest Peter Volk is a licensed professional counselor the director of a quip and co-founder of the Nashville family of brothers and ecumenically Christian brotherhood of men called to vocational singleness. He helps churches love gay people and celibate Christians find family Peter welcome to where do we go from here really glad to be here thanks for having me on cool what can I start where we always start which is asking a question around purity culture and what it was like for you growing up in purely culture growing up in purity culture well I mean as I'm sure we'll get to in our conversation a big part of my story is being a Christian growing up in those spaces realizing that I am gay and so it was a strange experience to here you know my churches talk about the need for sexual purity and particularly in youth group the you know guys only and girls only middle school you know conversations where the male kind of youth pastors would meet with all the guys and warn us about how much we would be drawn to women and warn us about the problems of looking at women in pornography and it was a really strange experience because I was not drawn to women in real life or important. And but I remember feeling the need to kind of pretend as if that was a problem for me with doing those particular kinds of people and those particular kinds of things because I didn't want someone to think I was abnormal but it seemed very much to the story was of course all Christian then our straight no of course all straight Christian men have a ravenous appetite that and the solution that they offered was just hold off for eight years, ten years and get married and then you can unleash all of your sexual urges on your spouse so for example horrible very romantic yeah yeah well um Peter let's just dive in to this topic you are a little bit um what does what does that mean hmm yeah so I mentioned earlier that I'm that I am gay that I'm a Christian I'm personally convinced of a traditional sexual ethic there are spirit-led Christians who I respect who you know have come to different conclusions that's okay but I also though while I'm not generally attracted to to women I did date a couple of women in college who I felt who I was honest with them about my sexuality but I thought they were cool they thought I was cool so we got to know each other and ended up kind of not trying to make it happen but kind of by accident falling in love and those relationships ended for reasons unrelated to my sexuality but long story short I knew by the end of college that Christian marriage with that woman could work for me if God was calling me to that and then I because I was gay and Christian and tended to do traditional sexual ethic I'd spent a lot of time reading what the Bible has to say about singleness because that seemed like the other alternative for me and I got to this point where I knew which I preferred between those two but something and and now I'll just say I think it's the Holy Spirit pushed me to instead of taking what I wanted asking God what does he want me to do which gift does he want me to give to use the language which gift does he want to give me the gift of singleness or the gift of marriage to use the language of 1st Corinthians 7 and through a period of discernment I felt God was calling me to the vocational singleness that we see in Scripture in that P19 and 1st Corinthians 7 which which I I understand it is a lifetime calling to abstinent singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention so that's what I feel like I'm called to that's not what all people are called to who are not Mary but I'm called to. Yeah that's I really love that explanation and that journey that you've been on their Pita really fascinating that you also dated some women in college because I think that something probably not every queer person would want to do or become to be with. Yeah but let's talk a little bit about where you're at now Pita and this choice to be to be I'm sorry for celibacy in your life and just determining that that call on your life is life long celibacy. Talk us a little bit, talk us a little, talk us through a little bit more about that choice and why that is your choice. Yeah so long story short. It's because I think it's what God wants me to do and it's the path that I think that I trust that God has told me will be best for me. Not because I think celibacy on the whole is any better than Christian marriage. I think they're equally beautiful equally kind of golf will sharing equally reflect the Trinity in important ways. But for me four years ago I kind of stumbled into a basically a discernment process on accident of talking to my therapist and my pastor and my friends and my parents about hey is God calling me to Christian marriage is God calling me to singleness. What do you think? And I was studying what the Bible had to say and what the church has had to say about celibacy and Christian marriage to make sure I had a healthy understanding of both and I appreciated what the purposes of both were. And I was looking back into my story and saying are there any guide posts or there any signs of their any breadcrum to suggest which path God might be calling me on? And then I looked in my kind of nine to five job and realized that I was doing some kingdom work that would be really hard to do as well if God was calling me to the to marry and to focus kind of first on the important kingdom work of raising kids for the sake of kingdom. And so I kind of was asking all these questions and realized when I read a book by Max Thurian called Marriage and Celibacy and then a book by Jesuit priest named Mark Tibidot called God's Voice Within about discernment. I realized I have just I've been doing a discernment practice a discernment process unintentionally and through that process God had given me confidence that what he's calling me to is that. So I think regardless of my sexual orientation and regardless of my beliefs about sexual ethics I believe God would be calling me to vocational singlemen. But I got to admit and to some listeners here who were saying okay but this guy is Christian and this guy is gay and this guy is committed to a traditional sexual ethics. So of course he arrived at Celibacy. It's different for me. I'll recognize that the being gay and Christian and committed to a traditional sexual ethics did force me to pause and maybe study parts of Scripture and consider questions that others wouldn't at least at least that cultural Christianity doesn't lead those in the majority to consider. But I actually think all of us should be considering those questions and I think maybe the questions that cultural Christianity leads us to ask aren't the best question. Okay so now we need to hear more about that. Keep going. I'd love to hear more about that if those are not the right questions what should we be considering actually what should everybody be considering? Sure. Well I'll say briefly that I think it's easy to make romance, an idol. romance is good, sex is good, marriage is good, I have not anti any of those things I'm not negative any of those things. But I do think I mean gosh just look at Disney channel movies and look at like listen to all of Taylor Swift songs I love Taylor Swift by the way. I'm just saying listen to her songs. The Bachelor of the Bachelor at so much in the media environment that we can assume promises that romance will fulfill all of our dreams. So of course a Christian in the West once they get been to go through puberty and they realize romantic desires and they think about gosh in adulthood what will make me happy. We're just on autopilot to go find a mate to settle down with and make a family with and enjoy romance with. And we just assume that's what we need. We assume we can just go take it on thinking lane as long as we can find someone who will consent to that with us and they like us and we like them. So I think that's what maybe cultural Christianity offers us the same narrative that culture generally does. It just says you know just save sex or marriage and go to church together while you're dating otherwise you can do everything anyone else is doing. You don't need to really consider any other any other you know reality. So I think instead I'm really I'm going to try to keep the brief if we look in scripture. If I look at Matthew 19 first Corinthians 7 there's parts in each of those chapters that seem to suggest that there are two options for the Christian that is Christian marriage and vocational singleness and God actually has a preference for which one each of us steps into. God wants to give one of those gifts to us more than he wants to give the other gifts to us. Again there's not a better gift on average in general but God has looked knows us knows what our futures could look like if we walked down the path of vocational singleness or the path of Christian marriage and he knows which would be better for us. So I think every Christian young adult instead of assuming romance and marriage will be for them should open handedly approach God in prayer and ask God I know what I would prefer but which do you prefer for me which gift do you want to give me which will be better for me would you give me the wisdom and confidence and and strength to accept the gift you want to give. Now that's going to take time that's going to take a process and obviously that kind of discernment process is very countercultural right now. Most of the spiritual mentors or pastors we might ask to help us with this process would have no idea how to help us with this process. We need to relearn as a church how to do this kind of discernment but this is not a new thing in the church. This is how many kind of Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Christians think about this. It is outside of the West. This is how the church has thought about this historically and I think a lot of good would come from maybe returning to this because if we discern which were called to then we don't assume or demand from the world either celibacy or marriage and whichever God gives us we'll see as a gift that we're stepping into because we're being called by God to go on mission with him through this specific location that it's an invitation to to to offer our bodies as a living sacrifice for the sake of the kingdom either through Christian marriage or vocational singlemen. Wow so many more questions, you know, I think I think we're very, very much looking forward to your book when you're going to write all these ideas down and be a resource for pastors and parents because I think that would be so wonderful. Pity sounds so confident and assured of this position you're presenting to us today and where you've arrived at. What journey did it always? Was it always that way or was there a period of struggle in wrestling and and what would you say to someone who's in that space? They're kind of still trying to disin that. Yeah so discernment takes time and it is rarely certain. I think I probably have the luxury that I've had a lot of resources over the past four years of discernment in my life to help me kind of increasingly step forward in confidence about that. I have had a priest in the English and church that I go to who is married but because of some other stuff in his life he became an oblate at a monastery in New Mexico and he grew this deeper appreciation from an emphasis and then for celibacy and for discernment. So when I started asking these questions he was able to come along, sightening and help me ask these questions. Someone early on in my process offered me that book God's Voice within by Mark Tibado and it offers a way kind of a it's a really great primer for general Christian discernment the oldest tradition of general Christian discernment and reading that book really helped me along the way. I've had the privilege of being able to meet with a therapist and be able with kind of my inner stuff and bring these questions before my therapist. Hey why do I have these resistances? Two celibacy and the Christian marriage. Can we talk about that? You know, can we do work around the wounds I have from being in the closet as a queer person and the way those might be frustrating my ability to really open-handly discern. The fact that I was able to be out to my church and share with them about this discernment is a resource that a lot of people don't have and then as we may eventually get into I'm a part of establishing a building, an economically Christian monastery in Nashville from men called to vocational singleness called the National Family of Brothers and having that context that lived in context of doing life with other men in vocational single to our discerning civil question has been so essential in giving me increasing confidence in what God is calling me to. Because obviously a big part of the Protestant Reformation was Martin Luther and others pointing out the abuses of celibacy and the theology of celibacy and the discernment of celibacy and the church and part of what Luther said Christians needed to do if they were going to do celibacy in a healthy way is they needed a practical, they needed practical circumstances in which they could thrive. They needed a lifelong lived in family where celibacy could find intimacy in healthy ways and could meet their intimacy in healthy ways and can find stability to then build up that overflow as they can serve their communities and they can build the kingdom. So yeah I've got a lot of resources and some more than the process that many others haven't and so it makes sense to me if you feel uncertainty about this and if you do feel what would like some more certainty maybe try to dig up even a little bit more to get some of the resources that I've listed here maybe they'll help you get more confidence. Yeah I that is so interesting I want to get to the Nashville family of brothers as did I say that right? Family of brothers. Yeah but before we get there I want to just close out maybe a dissection with this question you are a therapist right that is actually your job your that's part of your vocational work and do you do you notice an impact on people if celibacy is chosen as opposed to something that didn't feel for them like a personal choice like coercion or tyranny culture type stuff and yeah yeah absolutely absolutely and there are so many people in our churches who kind of are involuntarily delible. You know obviously front of mine for me are gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic who don't feel like kind of the complexity of the opposite sex marriage would work for them so they feel like celibacy is the only option for them but obviously the most numerous are our single adult Christian women in our churches who many of most of whom would like to marry but because there just aren't enough faithful Christian men in our churches they are single still there are many single single parents particularly single women in our churches who are our single not by choice there are there are the horses and widows in our churches who are single mop by choice so there's a huge percentage of of of Christians but people who attend our churches every week who who who don't feel like they chose their celibacy and I think that does make it difficult. I think that we when we kind of don't feel like our celibacy is chosen but it's being forced upon us and let me note when there is not teaching in our churches about celibacy in healthy ways when there's not celebration or valuing of celibacy in our churches when there is not practical support for celibacy in our churches when there's no way to find kind of lived in lifelong families in the body of Christ for celibate people of course we're going to resist celibacy if it's being pushed on us but I think that resistance often leads to celibacy resentment self-loading and then those things kind of when they stir around and not can lead to harm for us can be roadblocks who are thriving in our relationships with Jesus and with others so but I don't blame people who are in celibacy involuntarily for the fact that it stirs that up and down that's reasonable right I think the solution is well one if we're particularly talking about the most numerous group of single involuntarily single people in our churches which is single adult women again the who wish to marry it seems to me the problem is we don't have enough faithful Christian men so parents pastors get busy making sure we have more faithful Christian men in our churches but from your lips to God's ear but you know for those who for the rest of that group that I listed for those who may even though they don't prefer it may not have any choice but to continue in single-nost our churches have got to do a much better job of teaching about and celebrating and valuing and offering family to those who are in celibacy regardless of the I have a really practical question here you talked quite a few times about physical intimacy and I just I could see somebody listening and going okay but what does he mean by physical intimacy between a friendship situation could you get really concrete with us and maybe just tell us what that actually looks like for you guys yeah sure so I mean things like kind of hugs and things like sitting shoulder to shoulder next to someone on the couch and not scooting away uncomfortable even okay I'm sitting shoulder to shoulder closer to person you know putting an arm around someone shoulder as we're you know sitting in the kitchen watching some other guy cook the the meal that we're about to have for some people they may feel comfortable holding hands with someone for a brief period of time you know sitting on the couch and leaning your your head on someone shoulder other kinds of things like that you know different people have different boundaries for what kind of physical intimacy they can participate in that that doesn't kind of cultivate or stir up romantic or sexual desire so it's different for different people I don't want to like I don't want to make some offers some list of people of all of these things will be completely non-remenic and romantic and non-sexual for you so just go for it unthinkingly you know I think what's really important to point out here is I think there is this lie that the right kind of physical intimacy will be physical intimacy that we can engage in in unthinking ways and part of what that leads to is that tells married Christian people that lust is impossible within your marriage but as long as it's your your spouse and the eyes of God then you can just enjoy their bodies and take from their bodies unthinking ways and I just I don't think kind of connecting with another human I think there's always a temptation that we connect selfishly and that we take selfishly so I think we always have to not in an anxious paranoid way but in a wise Christian rightly ordering our desires way we've a somewhere to my mind it's always got to be wondering am I connecting with person with some motivations of self giving love and to communicate to them my care for them or am I am I selfishly taking from them in this day am I objectifying them in some way so I think that's true in marriage that's true outside of marriage and dating relationships that's true outside of marriage in friendships and physical intimacy and joy in friendship I so encourage everyone to keep pies and and recognize that we need to be thinking about these things so so that's all to say someone may hear like oh gosh well if you were a gay guy and then you're holding hands with some other gay guy and you're trying for that not to be romantic or sexual you just have to think about that a lot and kind of really steward kind of your heart and your mind to keep that in a healthy space and my my response is yes and whenever you're connecting with another human you should be self aware and asking yourself what like what are your motivations for connecting with this person and how are you treating the so the person as you're connecting with them yeah so that is the first half of our conversation with Peter Volk you can hear the rest of the conversation over on Patreon where Peter talks more about the natural family of brothers and we dive dive a bit deeper into all things celibacy with Peter on Patreon now we give us which gears and she out from Denny Trouque so Reverend Dr. Denny El Trouque is a Christian pastor leader and theologian with a ministry focus on biblical singleness sexuality world reformation and another related topics. Denny completed a doctorate through St. Mark's National Theological Center and Childs St. University her doctoral thesis is titled the end of singleness towards a theological retrieval of singleness for the contemporary church she's an ordained Anglican deacon and has served on staff at a number of different churches and is the founding director of the single-minded ministry she has an upcoming book on singleness due to be published by university press in 2022 Denny welcome to where do we go from here. Thanks for having me congratulations you guys well we always start with the same question as you know and that's about your own experience in purity culture now you're Australian I think and you're from New South Wales is that right from St. Mark's I'm a Sydney girl born and bred here that's right and so what was was there a purity culture or what was your own experience of the churches teaching on sex and sexuality growing I'm sure there were definitely sort of elements of purity culture I grew up going to church I grew up going to youth group you know working sort of through all of this teenage relational sexual stuff we're the bunch of other Christians in youth group and I'm just by nature always been a just quite a conservative personality I was sort of you know always the good girl and the oldest daughter you know my lighting life and so I'm sure there were elements of that of purity culture and I can know they're where I can look back and see but I think it was muted I think I belong to a church which was committed to teaching the Bible and that was you know what we were on about as a Christian community and so I think I had the benefit of actually wrestling with some of these ideas that were coming in through a just a couple of books maybe more than anything else at that stage it was sort of before the internet was you know where we went for everything and I think I had the benefit of youth group leaders and older Christians who helped me think about that in light of scripture and I think that's certainly true of a lot of other Christians I know certainly here where I grew up in Sydney it feels like our experience of purity culture was probably quite much a lot more muted certainly than what I understand it was in America and we've got a lot of people yeah yeah you all wanted the lucky one Stoney yeah well yeah well thanks Peter guide you know I think it's some a testament to the people that got put in my life and the church community that I belong to yeah that's awesome I know you know this isn't anecdote my best friend and her husband decided not to kiss until their wedding day so that was probably a process I got to kind of anything sort of hardcore purity culture but that was a just a personal decision for them rather than something that they thought needed to apply prescriptively to everybody so yes yes I had a friend too yeah did the same thing and yeah and then they couldn't put it down to a particular book or you know I thought it was just they just decided this is what we'll do yeah well Danny let's jump right in we're talking about cellar visey so what does being celibate mean to you? basis I think the trick question was celibacy because I think the word means different things to different people you know I was so interesting I was watching a documentary show here in Australia a couple of weeks ago it was on celibacy with on non-Christian show but it had a Christian owner who's a friend that might actually and a bunch of non-Christian also was on that ABC right SBS SBS insight I'm sure you can look it up online yeah we might link to it for we will and he's an Australian yeah yeah yeah that's right elsewhere it's very interesting because there was my friend Simon talking about he's in his mid-20s and he's at this point committed to a life of singleness and therefore as a Christian who holds to a above the poor traditional sex life epic celibacy or sexual abstinence for life but then there was a range of other people non-Christian those fascinating because they all had very different definitions of celibacy for them it was kind of a few of them had gone through seasons of intentional celibacy others were celibate but were expecting it to change so it's even just from kind of a cultural perspective celibacy means very different things but even in the Christian world I struggled because I I feel like we talk about celibacy or certainly in conversations I have I'm talking about celibacy and then discover I mean something different to what other people mean so when I talk about celibacy and it's not a word I use I use a language of singleness much more but when I talk about celibacy I'm talking about as a Christian person being unmarried who is sexually absent for so long as I am a Christian person who is unmarried but I have other I know other people who talk about it as a very quite a narrowly defined celibacy is if you've committed to singleness and sexual absence for life so it kind of excludes the possibility that you may ever have sex rather than where you're what you're committed to here and now for so long as you are unmarried so yeah that's what it means for me but I realize that I'm often talking across purposes and then I think just to throw another one in there it's fascinating because the early church meant that we completely different by celibacy too they just meant the word celibate just meant unmarried that's all right and so we I think we kind of look at celibacy as this early church thing and think that we're in a sense re-enacting what the early church thought about celibacy without actually realizing no no they just meant unmarried and the practice of celibacy as the kind of life long committed pursuit developed culturally and feel logically and sometimes quite problematicly over many centuries so it's very dynamic yeah very dynamic okay I like that now I think people don't understand how secular cidney is it's a very secular city um one of the most secular I think in the world actually probably not quite as secular as Melbourne but oh you think so yeah I think you saw that's funny okay all right we just have the mind of the whole song and the conservative fair enough yeah yeah yeah yeah and we've now got a Catholic premier ever I'm freaking out about that's right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right so I think the choice to remain celibate or essentially abstinent however you choose to you know say it this is this is a somewhat controversial choice in a really secular society it can be it can be a controversial choice in the church as well why was this your choice um it was my choice because it's I I understand the Bible to teach about the purpose of sexuality that we've been given what it means for us and humans have been created with a sexual nature and so I you know my understanding is that God didn't design sex and then marriage and say oh look I can kind of make these two work together he actually designed sex to serve marriage is what I get when I read scripture that sexual union between a husband or wife is designed to serve that marriage to be the context in which children are conceived and then born and disciple within that within that relationship now that doesn't mean that you know it doesn't mean that as a single unmarried person who is committed to being absent outside marriage that my sexual nature is kind of negligible or diminished or anything like that I actually see celibacy for me so long as I'm not married as a way to express my sexuality rather than a suppression of it it's how I direct the sexual nature that the God has given me towards this rather than towards that so for me it comes down to what do I understand the Bible say about the purpose and the place of sexual intercourse of sexual intimacy in God's design for humanity and you know not just well certainly the Bible is you know what I go to as an event event I'll question the Bible is my authority of sources revealed truth I mean I think it's so wonderful we have a God who's made himself known I think that's so exciting but there's also you know I think looking back over church history and looking how Christians have lived and wrestled and rapidly thoughts were it's a really important resource for us to actually be drawing from as well as we think through they think hmm you keep talking about this kind of distinction that you've drawn for yourself that it's for as long as you remain single obviously there will be people who embrace celibacy as a life long thing do you think as a single straight woman you've kind of embraced the ambiguity I guess of saying I'm not called to this lifelong thing in a definitive way you're kind of leaving that door open we've talked to people who when they feel or when they're in synchronous that they embrace a call of life long celibacy or life long singleness and that gives them a lack of that gives them certainty and there's no ambiguity in that and we've talked on this show before about this idea of ambiguous loss and that for a single person especially in the the a straight Christian single woman that idea of ambiguous loss and not knowing if this need will ever be meant this desire or this need for a spouse and potentially children etc how do you navigate that space being able to it sounds like you've been able to embrace that ambiguity and kind of live there what's that been like for you? So really interesting I like the language of ambiguity because I think that's a helpful one I I guess in some sense I've been able to embrace it but I have my moments you know it's not but I think that's true of all Christians married all single yes you know that life as you know fall and creatures in a fallen world is always going to be complex and sad at times and difficult and so I don't want to give you an impression that I've sort of got it all together because you know I know plenty of people who have committed to a lifetime of singleness for one reason or another and that sense of having made a decision for them doesn't automatically take away many similar griefs that I experience too so I think there's distinctions between our situations but there's also in many senses more overlap on the on the ground this is often what I think on the ground day to day that person Jane let's call a Jane lives a very similar life to Danny we're both in the moment committed to loving God loving others in our singleness in our sexual abstinence and I think I get a bit concerned that we draw very hard and sharp distinctions between Jane and Danny as if they're completely different realities of existence here and now because I don't think they are but just to go back to your original question sorry one often attention there I think I had always expected that I would get married and have kids that's kind of the trajectory that we we grow up thinking as Christians and not just Christians I think as people in our West and 20 as a women and women yet that threat so I had always expected that would be the case you know all my friends started getting boyfriend you know mainly through youth group and that didn't happen so I thought maybe at uni it would happen and that didn't happen and I kept waiting and then I went to Bible College and I thought right this is where it's going to happen and it didn't happen and so I think it was a bit of a process for me of going oh okay it may not happen and I guess that's the ambiguity what how do I live in that ambiguity and I think they came a point in my probably late 20s it wasn't a moment I think it was an unfolding kind of understanding that I can't my pinpoint that I just thought I'm just going to assume it's not going to happen I'm not saying I'm ruling out marriage but I think for the sake of my contentment in understanding remembering that God is sovereign in my life that he lungs for good things for me he knows the desires of my heart my heart I'm going to trust in that and just assume this is where he's got me for so long has he's got me while remaining open to the possibility now as women that does get harder the older you get to because you know you have to grapple with at that point the possibility of not having children of your own and what all of that means and I think I'm 43 now and so you know it's hard likely at this point in my life I'll have kids of my own but again I think it's not that I got to 43 and thought oh my gosh I'm never going to have kids and suddenly I'm just crippled by this brief I think it's a process that I've sort of been working through for well over a decade now which doesn't mean everything's but also I mean I think it means it's helped me to trust God in his goodness you know arriving at the point I'm at now it kind of sounds like you've found the way to be content like to have contentment as you say in the midst of ambiguity you know and like you've kind of narrating the ambiguity for yourself in the assumption that it's not going to happen and that I think that could be quite helpful to people listening actually yeah and you're quite think that I mean it's very true when we're talking about singleness and celibacy and you know not having sex and family but I think it's true of life you know we live the what we live in the now but not yet between you know the promise of eternity but that waiting to realise that and we all have longings and desires that are all different and we feel it different intensities and different seasons and I think it's part of the Christian life is wrestling with the ambiguity of what our heart belongs for in so many different ways while remembering that God remains good and we know that because of what he's done for us in Jesus you demonstrated that and so this is one probably quite key but just one example of what it looks like I think to live in that ambiguity is Christian here and now. I really love that because I think when you said that it made me think of all the different ways our need for prosperity and stability sort of infected us I think as Western Christians right there's this sort of expectation that life will not have that ambiguity because we can earn it we can fix it we can create you know our stable happy lives that are also church on Sunday and Christian community and yeah yeah I definitely yeah that's that's very interesting now I want to go back to what you said before about celibacy being a particular expression of your sexuality you have said that to me before in an interview and that really caused my brain to explode then and when I heard you say that I thought we have got to have you on the show to say that and you did and but more importantly to explain what you mean by that so please go on okay now I'm going to think back to what I told you how I would it was it was for you so if I'm not getting the right notes from what you remember redirect me I think we live in a world which this was so when I did my PhD I spent quite a lot of time looking back sort of over the first 1500 years of the church history but also quite a lot of time it last couple hundred years of Western history and then sort of evangelical history and I think what we don't realize is how how differently we think about things like romance romantic intimacy in marriage sexual intimacy in marriage and the priority of we sort of think the purpose of marriage is these two things as Westerners that's quite recent thinking you know there's an excellent book it's fire it's a secular book called um marriage a history how love conquered marriage it's fascinating to read and I think we the question of sex is also one of these things where we place sex at the very core of who we are as people now and not just sex is in a sexual nature but the the sense of enjoy sexual satisfaction or finding our sort of authentic selves according to our sexual desires and where they lead us and where they you know they direct us and I think it has so deeply embedded in the world around us that it has become really quite without us realizing it very much embedded beginning the Christian consciousness as well I think we need to take a step back and sort of go hang on it hasn't always been this way so what does that mean that we think about these things but where we are currently means that if living out your sexual instincts your sexual desires your sexual longing is fundamental to you actually realizing your authentic self living out who you truly are then any sense in which you aren't considered free or able to do that the world views as suppression as you not actually being able to be who you truly are and I as I read scripture that's not what I find and I find God calling us all unless we're married to direct our sexual expression towards godly intimacy relationally with people that is not the same as what that sexual intimacy looks like in marriage and so celibacy for me is not I must suppress my sexuality I must not let it out I must not give into it it's actually how do I take this sexuality that God given me as a Christian woman who is attracted to men but isn't married and and direct it towards loving him and loving other people as an expression of my sexuality rather than a suppression of it and I think for me the reason I know that is possible the reason I'm so confident that this is about expressing rather than suppressing is because when I look to what the Bible says about what life in eternity is going to be like what life in the new creation is going to be like we see in Matthew chapter 22 that none of us are going to be married to each other in heaven they will not be husbands and wives Jesus has that really any medic statement where he says instead you will be like the angels they will be like the angels and it seems there what he's talking about is this idea that the angels are celibate they're not actually engaged in sexual intimacy with one another they're not married so we have this picture of eternity where we won't be husband and wife we won't be having sex with each other we will be brothers and sisters we will I will still be me I will still be Danny you as a woman but I will be my perfected self my most authentic self and I'll be celibate I won't be having sex and so looking at that makes me realize if I'm going to be my trueest self and celibate for eternity that gives celibacy here and now that gives me as a sexually abstinent unmarried person here and now great dignity and significance in this life as I live in light of the next and kind of want to point to others towards that heavenly reality as well so there you have it our conversations with Peter and Danny as we've said if you would like to hear more from them and Danny speaks a lot more about her ministry single-minded over on Patreon so head to where do we go pod.com forward slash partner to join us and hear those great conversations all right Debbie so where are we going from here we're coming from two incredible people of this idea of celibacy yeah yes that was such an interesting conversation just on I think two people really helping us to reimagine what celibacy can look like I think one thing for me when I was thinking about this episode is just the ideas that we got in true love weights and for you and I growing up in purity culture and I know Jenna Duitt friend of our show I'll put a link to her Twitter feed and the episode that we've done with her this is one thing she said over and over again is there's a difference between I'm not going to have sex because one day I'm going to get married and have sex right there's a big difference between that and saying actually this is a choice that I'm making a lifestyle choice and for Peter and Danny a sense of a calling of obedience to God to say I am not going to have sex there's a two different things and I think that's where we want to invite all of us really to reimagine what celibacy can look like that it's not just pressing pause on something it's not suppressing something but it's something much broader figure something beautiful. Absolutely and I feel like in this conversation around celibacy we can see an embrace of a diversity of Christians right from from straight to queer including a sexual Christians you know we don't divorce yeah and it's it's and you know in the in the priesthood in ministry and in just normal the cruel I think me and yeah and it's it's just been a really great conversation and and a really great a great thing to do for for those of us who are married and both deviant I are married sit sit and listen to people who are experiencing a different kind of life and what that process has been like for them and I feel like we've we've got some ideas that we want to pull out Debbie kind of that that really stood out to us and just a heart highlight them to you before we jump in now both Danny and Peter mentioned talked to mentioned Luther or Danny said 500 years ago so we just wouldn't give you a really quick cheat sheet version of church history around that time because for some of you you might not be very familiar or monthly though you might think is a a black man from the 20th century in the US and that's Martin Luther King Jr. not only that who was a German monk from the 16th century who started the reformation and really up until then in the western world there was only the Catholic church and then Martin Luther changed all of that and he went from being a monk to being married to a a former nun. So what did that mean for the church? Well it was huge so I would say and I think before this in the Roman Catholic church and the Eastern Orthodox church there was really a place for a single this and it was more in the sense of the vocational celibacy it was a vocational role so the monastic place was quite honoured it was very honoured it was reverent in in Beth bars book Beth Allison bars book the making of biblical womanhood and our episode with her we talked a little bit about this how for women in medieval times in the Roman Catholic church if you were single you had a place and that was in monastic life you were elevated and the churches were split men at male and female so you're not sitting as a family unit you're not doing anything like that men are over here on the side women are here and there's a sense of equality whether you're married or single well I think so much of that change after the reformation because Martin Luther really emphasized the the goodness of marriage and the well I'm not sure how else to say it but and I think their personal biography was a big part in kind of going the the monastic system is corrupt it is bad it's bad for men to just be with men women to just be with women I'm a I'm a former monk she's a former nun we got married everything is fine and so one thing Beth's book says is how in the reformation you went from sitting men and women to you're sitting in family units right with the fathers the head of the family the potter familiar and so this only there's no place for singles right and so this is where I think the work that's happening now in the last 10 years is really to correct some of that way that the married and the family unit was sort of the elevated unit is in our churches this is the the thing to which you aspire to get married and have children and instead I think what Peter and Danny are saying is that singleness is something with dignity it is something to which you can aspire and I think Danny what Danny saying there the theological idea that the truth is we aspire to it because this is our destiny yeah this is our destiny in in the eternal sense is celibacy and singleness and that is that you know that's real yeah what I really lacked from both of them is there was a sense of intentional decisions and almost ritual to their life as celibate people and I think that's really important because for so many of us if you think about life is a married person and having a family this so many kind of rituals whether it's being engaged getting married, christening your children whatever it is that kind of brings you into a sense of kind of a rhythm of life whereas we could think of celibacy or you know people who are remaining abstinence is it's like well it's kind of just a big ambiguous language ambiguous or void or something like that and there's not that sense of like what like what is the path in this what's the road meant for what this looks like and we got a sense from both of them of what of you know they're chatting a path for others to follow and for Peter with from Peter for example this idea of really going through a process of discernment to determine that calling for himself of reading scripture of being in therapy and getting that support to really process that decision and come to that conclusion and I think that's that's a really really great take away a great piece of advice for anyone who is is contemplating long-term celibacy. Yeah I have to say when Peter Peter mentioned the word discernment so much and I thought to myself our churches are so lacking in that process of discernment for all things never mind people who are single and trying to discern if they are called toward vocational celibacy and I thought man what would our churches look like if there was space in there for people who were discerning anything you know Peter talked and this might just be in Patreon for partners to sign up guys Peter talked about the resources that were available to him when he went through this process of discernment he had a pastor who believed in this process and who made time for that process in his life he had a therapist so there's you know finance involved in that where he could really open up deal with his wounds and then he had people who gave him books and then he started meeting with 30 men for a year once a week to pray and eat and share a meal together with the intention of discerning things in their life discerning whether or not the national family of brothers was going to be a thing and whether they would join so there's a real sense to which you have to cultivate space in your life for that discernment to happen. And the thing that stood out to me from Denny was this idea of expression rather than suppression that was such that is such a pivotal change that really if you can kind of if that can make sense to give as a celibate person or as an abstinent person it changes everything. Yeah I think it's huge and I think we have to understand like how counter cultural it is because our culture says your sexuality is part of being human only if it is expressed in this way. Yeah and I think what celibate people are doing is so it's pioneering work to push back on that to say I'm fully human I am fully human and I am not suppressed I am not dysfunctional I am not repressed I am fully human in this way and I am a sexual person in this way and I channel my sexuality in this direction. It's just it's so important. Yeah the other thing that was huge was this idea of contentment and she spoke about an unfolding understanding of this and being out of fine peace with this idea of celibacy in a long-term way but in a way that doesn't necessarily mean that that could never change and I thought that was so powerful and yeah I think it really speaks to yeah just a wealth of not a wealth there just drawing on a big well of a big god and what and what that really looks like so I thought that was really great I hope people can listen to these amazing people talk about their experience and how they're choosing to live their life and being encouraged. I know if you know if I had heard these guys talk a few years ago it would have really it would have really been encouraging you know yep for sure for sure now some of you sent in your own stories about why you're choosing celibacy or absence and we want to share some of those here she'll like it going Jess. Celaitly yep okay so at b.original.emmelese says I'm choosing abstinence until if I remarry another podcast I listened to really challenged me to think through my why and I've been trying to figure that out beyond my belief that sex within marriage is gods intent. What I realized is that a big part of that choice is the reality that for me sex requires allowing myself to be physically mentally and emotionally vulnerable with my experience of purity culture and history of trauma. I don't think I can engage that part of myself outside the context of marriage therapy has helped me make sense of a lot of this but there's still some entangling going on. So there's that discernment idea right the discernment to know what kind of person we are and what we can say. At Elena Forsyth said I'm not waiting for anything I have an incredibly full life filled with family and youth great kids, leadership at work and a church and at home with full remates. I'm sure that makes some people cringe but I love it all and so do we that is wonderful I love that at Judy dog 88 says when I moved away from purity culture I started feeling pressured to have sex to just get it over with be less uptight fit in with the world around me. I started feeling similar shame and pressure as I did in purity culture this time for not having sex choosing celibacy allowed me to acknowledge my asexuality and gave me an immense feeling of freedom knowing I didn't have to have sex to be a functioning adult that I could be sex positive while also acknowledging sex isn't something I want and it came with a great relief and then this final one is an anonymous DM that somebody said to us do you want to read it or yeah I wasn't sure if that was a continuation yes I'm sorry just looking at an end so anonymous said people often think of cordon cord celibacy as a physical state like you're either having sex or you're not but maybe we should think of it as an an I quote spiritual gift of celibacy and quote to mean something more psychological to me it means that someone with a gift of celibacy means that they don't struggle with human loneliness or isolation or sexual desire as profoundly as someone who doesn't have the gift like mate like maybe they have the gift of connection or life purpose or meaning so even if they don't have a life partner they feel whole and complete so that's sort of similar to what Peter a little bit more like what Peter is yeah well guys that is it for our episode today on celibacy actually before we go I just want to say something I just want to share some moment of vulnerability with everyone who says okay please totally unplanned yes well I've actually I really want to thank Peter and Denny for joining us today and actually a reflection I had while they were talking to me is that I think for the um strait people like myself potentially we have deconstructed purity culture but we haven't kind of gone all the way and this is something that I think that I I can speak for myself and say I was kind of convicted and listening to them that it as much as I'm in this work and I've been in this work for years and my film and everything that we so this idea of the cultural Christianity and our emphasis on marriage and that emphasis on sex kind of hit favor-pitched in purity culture right that was like the big thing that it kind of the bubble burst after that because it was just like all right this is crazy but I think I fell into the trap of still seeing sex as a necessary part of whatever rebuilding my um you know Christian sexual ethic was gonna look like after purity culture I still fell fell into that trap of assuming that sex was a necessary part of my Christianity and I think I am seeing now and reflecting on hey this is that was still part of purity culture and when we listen to whether it's um you know our queer brother like Peter or our celibate sister like Denny it really helps us think bigger and wider about what it used to follow Jesus and it really helps us if further deconstruct that cultural Christianity and I'll admit you know I've been doing this work for years on this podcast and before as you guys know and you know there's still more more layers to go so we're so grateful for other perspectives and I hope you guys listening have found that as well listening today yeah I love that Jess that's that's beautiful thank you well our thanks to Peter Volk and Denny Trowik for joining us you can find Peter on all socials at Peter L Volk PIE TER L Volk and find Denny at DennyLtrowik.com and singleminded.com community for you Australians who might be interested in joining singleminded for their webinars and things like that or I guess anywhere around the world maybe even singleminded.com community is where you can find out more about them.
