 Who says the Bible has to be born? On the contrary, the Bible is the most thrilling book in the world. It's the only book with an invitation to join the very narrative you are reading. My goal is to be like your time traveling to a guide, taking you into an exploration of scripture and search of precious treasure, timeless, life-giving truths, then formus of who God is, who we are, and how the story of everything really is his story. I invite you to join me as we learn to read the story, trust the story, and live the story, because there's no greater adventure than knowing the God of the Bible. I am Brain Brickshar, and this is Adventure's Anthology. Alright, and we are on with Peter Volk, which is a really cool name. I'm so glad to have you on here, and just before we started this recording, after tell you guys that the story of how we even got Peter onto this podcast. It's one of those examples when we're redeeming the times in terms of social media. I found Peter on Instagram through the Explore page, where one of his reels, which was really well done by the way, I drift my intention enough to click, listen, and then go to his page, and listen to more, and then be like, you know what? I got to reach out to this guy, and you know, I reached out, and he actually responded, which I won't lie, Peter, I think I like did like a high five or something in my own head when I saw you message back on my device. Yes, we might actually get to have a conversation. No, it's really going to be such a blessing, and so without further ado, I guess I would like to introduce you to my audience. So I said your name is Peter, but Peter, would you tell us just a little bit about you, and a little bit about your story, and then I'm sure pretty quickly we'll get into how this relates to ministry in such. For sure. Yeah, thanks for having me, and I'm also encouraged to hear that social media does some good. So yeah, about me, I'm a writer and speaker about discernment between vocational sing-on-os-incristian marriage, and I also talk a lot about LGBT plus topics, according to a traditional sexual ethic. I've been published in places like Christianity today and spoken out, worked at, done trainings for over 75 different churches and Christian universities and campus ministries. So yeah, my day job is that I run a ministry called a quit, and we're a premier consulting and training solution for churches who wanted the come places where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic, and I'll define that in a second because I'm a user of it. Yeah, I know it will come back to that. So great. If you don't know what that means, folks, hang in there. Yeah, I'm about to define it, but yeah, we've worked up like 20,000 Christian leaders which are super cool. I'm a teacher and aspiring geek in the Anglican Church in North America. I'm also a founding brother of the Nashville family of brothers, which is an equiminically Christian monastery building family for men called to vocational singleness, regardless of sexual orientation. And then I'm a licensed professional counselor, specialized in serving gay Christians, hoping to steward their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic. Yeah, each of my jobs has to do with sexuality and finding belonging in the body of Christ because I'm a Christian. Jesus Christ is my personal Lord and Savior. I'm gay, I experience same sex attraction and I'm committed to a traditional sexual ethic. And when I say a traditional sexual ethic, I believe that God's best for every Christian is either what I call a vocational singleness, which is a lifetime vocation of absent and singleness for the sake of doing king to work with undivided attention that spoke about in Matthew 19 and 1 Corinthians 7 or Christian marriage, which Christians have historically understood to be a lifetime vocation of opposite sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom. So yeah, that's a little bit about who I am, what I do, what I believe briefly on these topics yeah, we'll get them. Oh, yeah, that is like your opener. The quickest nutshell possible of it and there's like so many things I want to explore. We might not even be able to get to all of it today. So we'll talk to talk another time and definitely I want to put some links below where people can find more about you in the resources you already have available. I think that's fantastic. So just I guess first though, would you be open to tell us a little bit more about your personal story in terms of the especially the faith and sexuality dynamic and where that came into play? Yeah, happy to. So yeah, I mean, I grew up in a part of the US where Christian kind of culturally conservative space where that we didn't talk very much about these topics other than kind of simple statement that God was against homosexuality. So when I realized an early middle school that I experienced same sex attractions, experience a lot of shame and hiding, I was afraid that others would find out and they would treat me poorly because of that. Between the ages of like 13 and 23, I for that decade, like I prayed hundreds of prayers that God would make me straight. I went to a hundred plus hours of counseling with a therapist who thought that he could change my sexual orientation. I spent nine months at a pray the gateway ministry, but my same sex attractions didn't change from those experiences. I also say I felt really alone growing up because I didn't think there was anyone else like me. So I grew up hearing on TV and the cultural around me a pretty horrible stereotype of gay people that they all went to group sex parties and they all had AIDS and they're all addicted to drugs and none of them wanted anything to do with Jesus. So based on that image, I didn't think I belonged among gay people and then on the other side, all the Christians I knew were straight or so I thought. And so I was led to believe in order to be a good Christian I had to be straight. And then there was me like stuck in no man's land in between these two extremes or these two things that at least I didn't fit into and I felt like I didn't belong anywhere. But yeah, thankfully, it's someone come alongside you to help you with those questions. Yeah, because how did you come to this place of, I mean, such maturity to where like, okay, I'm going to walk out a vocational single life. Yeah, the kind of impression you gave, if you guys haven't got to meet Peter, when you see his Instagram, then press your head for me, you have a joyful life. And I so I love that. So I guess like was there someone for me, Chanel that really came alongside you? Was it a book, a person or who helped with that transition? I'm sure that was over a period of time of course, but you think that helped along the way? I mean, I definitely grew up like big top of scriptures and reading the scriptures. And so as soon as I noticed these attractions in my life, I knew, well, I know what God's best is for his people. I know what Christian marriage is and isn't. I know like what at least that appears that the scriptures and God has to say about same sexual and romantic activity. And I never really questioned that too much, at least in the early years. So a lot of it was was dealing with what I tell anyone and was that shame and fear and hiding and hoping that it would change. I would say later when I got to college, you know, well, back up a little bit, when I was in middle or middle high school, I did share with my parents one time about this part of my story, but really more sharing with them that I was like struggling with pornography and the pornography was gay pornography. But we didn't really have any prolonged conversations after that. So I was still just really just making sense of this alone until I got to college. And I was a part of a Christian fraternity. And then I was also part of the campus ministry and the same kind of guys were in both of these spaces. And, you know, by the time I got to kind of sophomore year of college and I had really close friendships and kind of the first time I had had close guy friends since middle school. And feel like I could trust them, but also felt the sense of like I was not telling them about this part of my story. And I knew I didn't really believe that they loved me unless I shared fully about what my story was. And so it actually lined up with kind of an event where a guy got, he left our Christian fraternity because he was kind of refusing accountability about having a boyfriend and having sex with his boyfriend. And, but in response to that some guys and our fraternity didn't, we're kind of talking about the whole topic and really a really problematic ways. And so I felt, you know, I felt God put it on my heart to share my testimony with this fraternity of having enduring same sex attractions continuing to be committed to a biblical sexual ethic. So that guys in the fraternity who were straight would know how to care for people like me better and guys who are in the fraternity who were gay would know they weren't alone. And that kind of began this process of sharing with a lot more guys about my story. And then from that, having other people that I could make sense of my story with, having brothers and cries to weren't gay. But you could ask me tough questions. And it could help me hold me accountable and help me, you know, make sense of the tough topics. And when I started to kind of examine the Scriptures more carefully and heard some convincing arguments for a progressive sexual ethic, it was kind of among these brothers in this fraternity that really helped me kind of make sense of those questions. But also like after sharing with this fraternity about my story over the kind of six months after that, like 10 or 15 guys in our fraternity shared with me that they too were gay and Christian and committed to a traditional sexual ethic. And we started making sense of life together. And I think having friendships with other men who have the same story and were also committed to Jesus created this space for us also to like move beyond this just hiding and shame and trying to minimize this in our lives and ignore it in an unhealthy way. And instead shine light on it and bring Jesus into the conversation about it and make sense of okay, we're getting to the end of college like I'm going to graduate into being a young adult and making plans for the rest of my life. How do I do this in a way that is sustainable for a lifetime? So I'd say that was going to the space for making sense of that. And yeah, I've had some kind of mentors and pastors along the way, but that's kind of been a little bit more intermittent. It's really just been Jesus being faithful to minister to me through kind of brothers and sisters and Christ that I'm doing like with. Yeah, now you're providing that for others. Like you're literally providing that for others. Communities of people who like you said whether gay or straight are committed to vocational single and this is that correct. Like that's. Yeah, yeah. So you know, there's a kind of funny story about that because I, so about this time I got out of college, but while I'm not bisexual, I'm not generally kind of romantically sexually attracted to women, I was in a Christian fraternity that had data events that I had to take girls to. I was also fairly kind of out on campus like people knew that I was gay and the girls that I took to these data events knew I was gay. But a couple times, you know, would take girls on these data events. You would have a good time. I would say, hey, you know that I'm gay, but this was fun. Do you want to keep on hanging out? And, you know, two of them, well, three of them, we were in long term like dating relationships and two of them I fell in love with and one of them I, we almost got engaged and didn't get engaged for reasons unrelated to sexuality. But, you know, I knew like marriage with a woman could work for me if that's what God was calling me to. It would be different than some other people's marriages, but it could work. I also had read with the scriptures had to say about the single list for the sake of the kingdom, so I knew that was an option. And so I can't explain it in any other way other than the Holy Spirit made clear to me, I was supposed to ask God if he had a preference which I stepped into. Like there's this language that Paul uses in 1 Corinthians 7 that the guy wants to give one gift to some and another gift to others. We seem to suggest that like, we don't all have both gifts by default and that God has a preference which gift he gives us. And we probably be served best by seeking his preference and asking for that gift and stepping into that. So anyway, by kind of an accidental discernment process that became clear to me that God was calling me to the kind of single list that Jesus talks about in Matthew 19 and Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 7. But I like, I didn't think I had some kind of magical gift of celibacy that didn't need human companionship anymore. Like I still noticed like I need family and excel a bit family, non-romantic family, but I need family. So I met with my pastor and he actually died about a year ago. The late Father Thomas McKinsey, I go to an angle of con church. And I shared him with him about what I felt like I was called to and how I'm still feel like I needed family in the body of Christ and I was asked him, what do I do? And he was really honest and he said, Peter, I don't think you're going to find the kind of family you need in celibacy at this church or at any church in Nashville anytime soon. And he was married and happily married, but you know, he was also actually connected to a monastery out in the Southwest and did like life with like celibate dudes, committed to celibacy for a lifetime. So he knew what you needed to do celibacy well for a lifetime. But he said to me, well, as he said, like monasticism or some version of intentional Christian community involving celibacy has been the primary way that celibate people, that single people for the Lord have found family. It's been the greatest source of evangelism in the church. It's been the greatest source of theology in the church. It's been the greatest source of social justice in the church. So he basically said, I think you should go start some kind of intentional Christian community in Nashville. Stay connected to our church. And then teach us how to do intentional Christian community better and get what you need in the process. Yeah, that was the beginnings of what's now the Nashville family of brothers, which is like an intentional Christian community for Christian guys called to vocational singleness where we can find family. And then that family, like empowering us to go leverage our singleness for the sake of the kingdom to serve God and to bring the brain his kingdom more quickly. Yeah, that's so cool. And you have a great Instagram page that's more information on showcases. I do. And gosh, I just so many thoughts and questions. I'm just excited to like unpack you. And I think the first thing into me just comes out of this place of like kind of past store or concern of like I feel like the church at large has not done a good job with even even beyond this being let's say a gay or straight issue showcasing the friendship. And even how like so like you said in church history, I think many people are unaware how many people have chosen vocational singleness. So it was advantageous to them to be single for a variety of reasons. Yet like you said, these were not people who were isolated. They were committed to community. And like you said, just social justice, into scripture, into a very fulfilling relationship with Jesus that as in the contemplative tradition, by the way, which I read a lot from as well, I am so enthralled by how much they love and experience the love of Jesus. And to me, this is part of the disconnect. Something has happened and especially the very, very modern church where we see singleness as a season and it's like, oh, I'm sorry if you have to be single or something like that can you just speak a little bit to what you've seen in the church on this on this. Yeah, you're singleness. Yeah, so I'm going to send a little bit Catholic here at the beginning, but they're okay with that. Okay, there you go. You know, I think a lot of people who think deeply about this regardless of their to nomination would say the possibility of widely available contraception really challenged the the idea of whether marriage is for raising kids. And if you're not raising kids, you can be celebrate. And there's a clear distinction between these vocations and their faithful ways to do them both. And then the sexual revolution comes and says, no matter the point of sex is not to raise kids, the point of sex is romance. The point of sex is pleasure, primarily. And Catholic spaces did a okay job. I think I'm pushing back on that primary message of the sexual revolution. But I think most products and spaces, and I'm am a Protestant, and most products and spaces, kind of accepted most of that. And just said, yeah, that's true. Just just make sure you save sex for marriage. And so there's been a lot of abandoning historic Christian teaching on whether one of the key purposes of marriage is to faithfully raise kids for the sake of the kingdom. We kind of compromise on what the Bible really has to say about a bit of a divorce and remarriage. And we compromise on what the Bible has to say about considering Christ and Paul's invitation to singleness for the sake of the kingdom. And all of that has led to a lifting up of the idol of Romans. Yes. And therefore, devaluing of vocational singleness of intentional Christian community, of friendship. Friendship. Yeah. And then I think more recently what we see is, so that's led to like a plummeting of marriage rate. So the rate of marriage is in the church right now is 60% less than it was 50 years ago. And so that alarms for good reason, I think, alarms pastures. The because it'd be one thing if we were 60% less marriages, but then there were 60% more people committing to singleness for the sake of the kingdom and really faithful and fruitful ways. But that does not what has happened. You've got 60% less marriages. And like, mostly 60% more people just continuing in like perpetual, uncommitted, young adulthood. Yeah. And that's not good for, I mean, most importantly, that's not good for like the God. They're not good for our sexual stewardship and that's not good for like the kingdom work we could do. And ultimately that's not good for the gospel. So I think a response to that, many pastors believe that we'll we just need to sell marriage better to increase marriage rates and that the enemy of marriage is singleness. And I think the tweak I'd make there is that we need more marriage in the church and we need more people committing to the kind of singleness that Jesus talks about in Matthew 19 and Paul talks about in 1st Corinthians 7. I think those, those two boats, healthy vocational singleness, healthy Christian marriage. The the tide, arising tide raises both and a falling tide, drags down both. GK Testersian is a quote from one of his books that says, when the monks return, so will marriage. And he's suggesting that like, yeah, a porthiality that either of these affects the other. So yeah, that's my like refistry of like what I think we're wherever at in the church right now. Yeah, I know. And and I agree. I think there's the church that's kind of played into the over sexualization and culture and this review that romance exclusively is this end all be all of like fulfillment. And so going back to something a few things you've said with Paul for example, so I know that Jesus and Paul both talked about this. Let's put Jesus aside for the sake of those who feel like, okay, he's Jesus. All right. So Paul talked about this and lived this out. Now I think it's quite easy first to forget that Paul does not strike me as kind of guy who had an unfaffilling or joyous life. He had a dreadful and very fulfilling life. And so I feel like part of this is how we package it. You're right that like marriage is somehow the only way you will be fulfilled yet in my experience. And I don't know how I don't know how I'll pervasive this is around the country. So I can't speak to that. But in my personal experience, our church, I actually talked to quite a few couples who are experiencing loneliness. Now wait a second, time out. How is a married couple in the in granted? Some of most these are actually healthy marriages. So it's not like that. Yeah, lonely because my spouse completely ignores me. Okay. Not talking about that. I'm talking about the situations where it's a healthy marriage. And so in those cases, why are they still lonely? I feel like part of it is because this thing where it's been communicated as marriage will be the end all be all. And so I guess what can you say in terms of how even talking about this? What needs to be tweaked in even how we view relationship with God? Yeah, if you know, do you get my saying to see I apologize? Yeah, I'm struggling to find the question, but I'm wrestling with this because I feel like there's something really insightful here. Yeah, so you know there's a lot that there's been a lot more conversation. I think healthy conversation particularly in the past year about the kind of the the the the the the the tier erration of institutions and trust and institutions. But this is really just on the the the back end of decades of people kind of divesting from community. And investing in like the self or a couple of things or people that are just an extension of the self. And and we're not made to be alone. We were we were we were that God we began in the garden and God saw that it was not good for us to be alone. And we were ultimately made for a city where we will be with God and each other for eternity, you know, so I think a great book on this topic is Rodney Clap's Family at a Crossroads. And instead of kind of blaming the typical scapegoats for kind of why we are where we are. He actually points it at free industrial revolution. Most people lived in the not only the same state not only the same city not only the same neighborhood but like literally the same building their entire life and lived in multi generational multi family communities and attended the church that was most approximate to them. And they didn't change cities if they changed jobs and a lot of them never changed jobs. And there was a sense of community you get from that that like okay maybe people weren't making lifetime commitments to their neighbor and making lifetime commitments to their church in a way that we would think about it today. But functionally they all had lifetime commitments to their neighbor and to their church. And that afforded them a certain thickness of family and the body of Christ that you can't get without that. And so then the Industrial Revolution happens and we gain this with technology and wealth and growing middle class that we can move cities if we want to. And we can move into single family homes and put doors and miles and highways in between us and other members of the people we go to church with. And that leads to just a disconnectedness from the body of Christ that is really new. Now I'm not suggesting some like really really not suggesting the most radical of solutions. But I am suggesting that I think you know, Windleberry has some good things to say about this and some other people who like to quote kind of Windleberry in the sense of maybe we need to commit to a place and the people in that place. And we'll experience less loneliness. Maybe the problem isn't that our spouse isn't the right fit and that's why we're lonely. Maybe the problem is our spouse alone or our spouse and God alone were never in midst to be enough to meet our intimacy needs in a broken world where, you know, we need our intimacy. We interact in perfectly with all the people and beings around us. And that we need to be committed to more things. Because we only kind of invest in things and let ourselves get used to depending on receiving from things as much as we know they are safe. And they will continue and relying on this is not a risk or relying on this is, you know. And we've got to a place where the only people that people rely on is their spouse and maybe some of their immediate family. But otherwise, every other relationship is we know is precarious because we want the freedom to be able to leave that friendship if we want to for a job or for a better house or whatever. But because we know that we don't expect much from them. Yeah. And then we start expecting way too much from our spouse. And then we don't have a spouse. We can't expect anything from anyone. Yeah, I mean, do you feel like part of this is because and I get when people say this I'm not just agreeing with this phrase entirely, but when basically when a lot of churches and pastors and preachers talk about how your family is your first ministry. And so hammering it home to a point where church becomes like anic doodle to a community. And if you need community, the church is there for you. But like it's not the same primacy of importance as like let's say you're nuclear family. And I get that I get this I'm not disagreeing with that entirely. But I feel like there's a both and and there's somewhere. Especially since I and you sound like you know your history and I respect that. But speaking especially went back to even biblical history to the New Testament. There was a time when the church was a family. Yeah, just a parliament has a great book on that when the church was a family. Great book. But yeah, I mean, what do you feel like is the call to the church in terms of like embracing this? But I've already been unpacking this. But like if you share put it together, what's the call to the church here? Yeah. So I would really encourage Christians to when we when we hear when we read and scripture about family and the importance of family or we hear a sermon about family and the importance of family. You know, if you went and you interviewed a a first century Christian and asked them what a family meant. The very unlikely to say the mom and dad and two kids or whatever, right? If they're going to draw or if you you kind of gave them a piece of paper and put the whole family tree on there and asked them, okay, draw a circle around what the family is. They would have included in that circle of what a family is, you know, multiple generations, multiple like units of nuclear families that live together and cooperate in lots of different ways. So it just is there's some yes, like the family's importance, right? I mean, God, we are embodied. We can't be in multiple places at the same time. We live in a in a material finite world. So we can't have deep meaning for relationships with a hundred people, right? Like there's a certain, there's a certain, you know, number and even is, you know, there's lots of studies to show that like beyond a group of, you know, ten people or 15 people, you know, you can only know so many people at such a such a depth. Was it a number something like 150 or something like that? Even then I feel like that's, yeah, a lot. Yeah. So that's all we'll say, there's something in the way that God has made us, that we need deep relationship. We need deep relationship with more than one or two people, but also there are limits to how many people we can have deep relationship with, which means we have the kind of decide who and the people we're going to commit to, having deep relationship with, and then be willing to prioritize them. So we're not, I'm not suggesting kind of thin relationships with everyone, but I am suggesting readjustory, you know, putting our eggs in a couple of more baskets, then we're currently putting it in. So yeah, but I think I think the first step for the first step for believers is just to be honest with ourselves about what our needs are and honest with ourselves that we see in the garden that God didn't make us for just relationship with Him. That's not because there's anything inadequate about God or anything like even that's the pre-fall reality. Okay, and if you interview all of the kind of the faithful Christian marriages that you know in your church, very few of them are going to say, if any, that they meet all of their intimacy needs right in their relationship with God and their spouse alone every week. And so all of a sudden, need more than that. So so first let's like notice that that's true. Then let's be honest, if we feel like we're not been getting what we need and that, and that pains us and maybe even it makes us more open to temptation because we're not meeting our intimacy needs enough. And then let's let's treat that then meeting our intimacy needs in healthy ways as one of the spiritual disciplines, right? We are not just a soul in a mind, we are also a body and caring for our body, taking care of our simple well is part of of of of of of of a faithful Christians to our I think once we when's we kind of right size that and see it's a part of our spiritual disciplines to to have community, to cultivate community, to maintain community in healthy ways. Yeah, maybe that that will that will help us. Yeah, this is good and again, this might come across as like a side observation and question, but I want to like bring it up anyway. I mean, I feel like part of the advantageous side of being single for the kingdom is so when Paul who was single talks about marriage as like a metaphor of the gospel. If you think about it this way, like you can have the real thing without the metaphor and here's the thing in the metaphor. Marriage is the metaphor between a man and a woman is a metaphor. The real thing is Christ in the bride. Now he even links it and I'm going to Ephesians 5 here. He even links it to like hey back in like as it was said in Genesis 224. He's saying that there was something that even like foreshadowing, pointing forward to something that was unclear at this time, that time. Even in the prefall conditions that it would be true of eschatologically about Christ in the church so Christ would bride. And so do you feel like at least even from your own experience now because this isn't theory, for me experience what do you sense is so fulfilling about you have to lean into the Lord in a unique way to say it about. I guess to find some deeper fulfillment intimacy that I think some married people equally need, but don't even search for because they're promised to find this in marriage. I speak about this as a married man who knows I deeply need this from Jesus. And so even with my son I can't put that on her and she knows she can't find this in me. I guess you can just share a little bit more about your experience of finding that in Jesus. And we've talked about by the way we've talked about how you also find it in community so we're not ignore it. Yeah, if we can tune in on that piece. Yeah. Yeah so I think what's tough with this question for me is and I've shared about a couple of places on this online and we can link an article in the in the show notes but you know I've actually I'm kind of in like the the 9th or 10th year of a pretty prolonged dark night of the soul or pretty prolonged time of desolation. Yeah of exhalation. Desolation. Desolation. Yeah, when it comes to my intimacy with God and so I don't I pretty intermittently experience a kind of a sweetness in my relationship with Jesus or a kind of an undeniable emotional experience or connection which which at first glance one could say well gosh like you not only you don't you don't have marital intimacy but then you're experiencing the kind of this drown you're what the difference you with God like how do you manage and you know I brought that question to to my to my pastor and and what one he reassured me that the loft of people experience feeling of distance from God for years or decades or their entire life and that doesn't mean the God's not real or that God's unfaithful that God doesn't love us that's just what it looks like for some people but he he did read it you know my pastor reminded me that God the Father and God the Holy Spirit are not human they are holy other than me and so that that's kind of a to expect some form of or some analog of human intimacy when God the Father and God the Spirit maybe is is not it's not how historically the church is taught about right kind of religion with God and then God the Jesus God the Son is human but it is not here right now and so it's if we experience if we like experience this presence of God's absence maybe that's kind of fitting knowing where we are in God's big story we have the Holy Spirit I'm not denying that we have the Holy Spirit but but the sense of like yearning for so much more intimacy with God than we currently have maybe kind of fits where we are in in the big story but I say on top of that beyond that my pastor did he did reassure me that you know what it's meant historically for believers to kind of love God has been to obey his teachings has been to do his work has been to enjoy intimacy with with his people and to believe that like particularly in the gathering on Sunday but also gathering another time during the week with other brothers and sisters in Christ we can experience the love of Jesus through them that they are kind of a small S sacrament that there's something sacramental about gathering in the body of Christ and that's a means through which Jesus connects with us so I think what I'm learning to do personally so I'm not I want to clearly not saying this is true for all of the people I'm just saying this is what this is what my story has looked like and learning as we are building out this Nashville family of brothers a place where I can find family in the body of Christ family I can trust and I can let my heart receive from is then every day that I that it feels a little bit more like a real family that I can really trust I'm also reminding myself of whatever sweetness of love I'm experiencing from these guys in the Nashville family brothers is always simultaneously Jesus wanting to love me through them and Jesus being Jesus knowing kind of where I'm at and why I'm at and being so eager for me to experience the fullness of what the Nashville family brothers can be because he wants me to experience his love even more fully. Wow that's good and I agree man I mean I think there's a fitting side to feeling that I miss like to speaking of God like I miss him because there's this sense where his presence isn't quite manifest yet there's there's eschatology yet as yet to be done because this isn't the the renewed re-world resurrected world yet where his presence is going to be fully with us so I agree that of course it's like it's almost like of course we don't experience the the kind of like quality of love and fulfillment even with God that we will one day have. So I agree I think it's a huge part of it and now and now it's interesting I guess there's like two more things for sake of time that I guess I want to get to real quick first one is you know what's kind of some of the myths in terms of like how vocational singles can find even quote unquote intimacy as friends you know the quote in the could just even the quality of life and like doing life together as friends like where some of the biz or like some of the things you want to speak into that. Yeah yeah so I think some some is really trying some of maybe wisdom that the the married people have it's really transferable and some isn't so I think one thing that is transferable is that any relationship any friendship to really get the the hard earned rich meaningful long term friendship it just requires you to keep on doing it even when it's boring even when it's irritating and it's probably not going to happen organically you know you know I you know I I have to I have planned on my calendar kind of recurring hangout times with my closest friends because I know even though they are my closest friends and I have a hope that like 50 years from now these are going to be the people who are holding my hand when I die or I'm going to be holding their hand when they die they still get boring and if I just wait until I can be like hanging out with them just get to the time to hang out with them then will be weeks but I know if I just make myself do the rhythms of maintaining these friendships 15 minutes into each of these hangouts most of the time I'm like I'm so glad I'm here you know I'm so glad we're starting this time together so so it's you know you've got it in in some ways like you've got to date your friends yeah in the way that they tell married people you never stop dating the people you know it's a friend just no different you know non romantic non sexual friendship different so I think that's true I think I've been surprised that over the past you know particularly 15 years as I've been more intentional about friendship I have better friendships with the people who I didn't prefer to be my friends than the people I did and I'm not saying we can't be friends with the people who like friendship comes most easily to us but there's something about again there's an analogy here to romance where if the reason why we were drawn together in the first place and the reason why it was because it was so easy because it was such an easy fit and if we got used to this working because it's just so easy then what happens when it gets hard what happens when it gets boring whereas the the friends that I maybe have less in common with and from the very beginning it was hard work um yeah that was what we always expect that would those were always the expectations and and there was something actually more beautiful about that that like all we needed was the common bond in Jesus Christ nothing else nothing else is necessary um so I I think that's been meaningful and then last thing I'll say is I think we just my understanding as a therapist is that we have emotional intimacy needs spiritual intimacy needs physical intimacy needs an intellectual intimacy needs and we can get some of each of those from friendship in healthy ways with healthy boundaries but even in my friendships with married people with married women married men who have you know and people who have no attractions to men or women these individuals you know they they they they are needing emotional and intellectual and physical and spiritual intimacy in their friendships and their marriages are healthier when they in healthy ways get some of that from their friendships yeah I go um and and and and I've seen that like my friendships with particularly my like married guy friends are the our healthiest when when they're not afraid when they're not when they're honest with their spouses about about like the the the their human and they have limits and like the they they both will be friendships um and they're not ashamed of the fact that they need some things out of my friendship that that maybe they're not finding in their marriage and not in I don't know weird not in any kind of romantic or sexual or inappropriate or territorial way but just like he went to different you know we get different things from different people and the marriage that I'm actually the couple that I'm closest to and that I'm the godfather to to one of their kids we just laugh about some ways that like there's some ways I understand both of the spouses in ways that they don't understand each other so so lots of ways that they they understand each other that I don't but it's just funny how like we we all learn from each other and we all we all kind of offer each other things that maybe the others can't you know so yeah I think this whole conversation is just in a sense part of something larger like again redeeming the value of friendships within the truth I know this isn't exclusively that but I think that's just a huge part of it like you said of it just not enough when the church just has a strong stance on a sexual ethic typically but doesn't offer like or have a theology even back you're even a practicality behind it of strong friendships in community yeah and like you said it broke my heart when you were telling the story about how your pastor's like you won't find that here and so in a sense you had to like be a pioneer of helping create these sort of communities so that's gosh that's good work man I guess for the sake of time then one last thing I have to close with you is uh well what what's something else you're working on now like well what are you working on is it a particular part of this conversation or is it something completely different what's that next thing you're kind of working on to either present or write about yeah yeah what what are you working on next so in a lot of different processes right now there's a lot of retrieval going on there's a lot of okay church fathers mothers early church yeah how were they talking thinking about lots of different things and how will we go back and retrieve that how can we learn from some of the first audiences of Jesus and the apostles wisdom and so I'm really curious these days about how did the early church do celibacy yeah and and I think when we when we think early church celibacy I think we maybe we can go go go go most quickly to these like desert monks and these cave celibates but like even before that before that what did it look like if a Christian heard Jesus and Paul's teachings about this single look for the sake of the kingdom and they said yeah I think that's what I'm called to what about how did they live that out right and and how could we maybe imitate that today how could we learn from that you know because I do to something too we are given everything in scripture we need for salvation period we know that to be true and I'm gonna hunch that like the the first audience to hear Jesus and his apostles speak and and those that first hundred hundred fifty years of the church they had some extra content that we don't have to understand what did Jesus and Paul really mean when they said these things and then what does it look like to put it into practice and so I think there's just a richness there so I've got an article that's going to be coming out in an ex-stasis magazine which is a a Catholic kind of literary mat magazine which talks about an experience I had looking at art in an art museum about celibacy but then kind of taking using that jumping off point talking about what did what did this look like in the early church and what can we learn about it and and and what if we were treated that so I'm gonna be yeah okay I can put to that is that I'll be yeah I think it's gonna be like a month until like published but so people just have to probably not think you're like keep you're getting updates on these things right that's kind of more of story right you're gonna be telling people about what you're writing what you're thinking and all that so okay that's good that's good all right any final final words for people I guess in this case like those in the church who have a leadership position and have influence on what can be done moving forward final words for them yeah that I think that book by Rodney Clap family across roads is a great read and then I think if you pair that with a book by like I mean Wesley Hill called spiritual friendship which really lays out a rich theology and history and the church of Christians doing intimate meaningful non-sexual non-romantic friendship and looking to the examples in scripture of that kind of friendship to fill that out I think those two books together I think we will give us the right tools to see what the problem is and what the solution is in terms of addressing the loneliness that all kind of people in our churches are experiencing so that would be my final recommendation panel so good well I know it's a continuing conversation so we'll definitely definitely be having you on again you
