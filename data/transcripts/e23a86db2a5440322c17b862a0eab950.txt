 Welcome to Head to Heart Podcast. I'm your host Jenny Markham. This bi-weekly podcast is created to be a safe space to admit what we truly believe in our hearts. And many of us, when we take the time to truly examine ourselves, will find some sort of shame, fear, or lies hiding in there. And it is never God's will for us to stay in bondage to those. It's his truth that sets us free from them. But there's a huge difference between having biblical knowledge floating around in our heads and actually believing that it's true. Until God's truth makes its way into our hearts, nothing changes. We'll be doing a mix of solo episodes and interviews with friends who have experienced the freedom that comes when head knowledge becomes heart knowledge. The truth will set you free so you can walk every day in the freedom God desires for you. It's time to let go of shame, fear, and lies. Those aren't yours to carry. Thanks for joining us. Welcome back to Head to Heart Podcast. I'm your host Jenny Markham. I'm introducing a brand new guest today. So I'll just give you the floor Peter and then why don't you introduce yourself. Tell us about who you are, what you do, and make sure there's a fun fact in there somewhere. Okay, sounds good. Yeah, Jenny, thanks for having me on the podcast about me. I'm a writer and a speaker about discernment, vocational, single-ness, LGBT plus topics according to historic sexual ethics. And I've been published in places like Christianity today and Mia Orthodoxy and for over 100 churches and universities. I'm the founder and executive director of Equip, which is a premier consulting and training solution for churches that like one of the complexes where LGBT plus people can thrive according to historic sexual ethics and we've trained over 30,000 Christian leaders. I'm also a teacher and aspiring deacon in the Anglican churches in North America. I'm, this is an interesting one. I'm one of two founding brothers of the Nashville family of brothers, which is an ecumenically Christian monastery building lifelong family in Nashville for men called to vocational, single-ness. And I'm also a licensed professional counselor and I specialize in serving gay Christians hoping to steward their sexuality according to historic sexual ethics. And I guess a couple of like maybe recurring themes in all of that is each of my jobs has to do with sexuality, finding belonging in the body of Christ because I'm a Christian and I'm gay and I'm committed to historic sexual ethics. And when I say historic sexual ethics just to be clear what I mean is a belief that God's best for every Christian is either vocational, single-ness, which is defined as a lifetime vocation of abstinence, single-ness for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention. Or God's best is Christian marriage, which Christians have historically understood to be a lifetime vocation of opposite sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom. So yeah, that's just some of what I do and a little teaser of my story and kind of what my convictions are on some of those things. Oh, and a fun fact. Let's see, vibe shift here. When I was a freshman in college back in 2009, I met Taylor Swift at the J. Crew in Nashville. Oh my gosh. And we talked and we got a picture together and I touched the smaller for back. So that's a fun fact. And I think at one point, maybe a couple years ago, after I was out on social media, I posted a photo of the photo of her and I, with some kind of joke like, yes, I met Taylor. Yes, I got to touch the smaller for back but no, it didn't make me straight. So. So that's that's a fun fact. Fun fact. That's a very fun fact. Okay. I just want to say this out of everything you just said, it gives a great picture about who you are and your vocation and everything. But in all of that, really stood out to me. I just need to clarify is the monastery. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Because what I picture and probably what listeners picture is you walking around as a monk like in a rope. And I'm sure that's not what you do. So what do you mean by that? Yeah. So there's multiple ways to define a monastery. And there's definitely this like kind of a set of self deprivation, kind of detached from the world in a variety of ways. Stereotyp that maybe it's almost like a Hollywood stereotype of a person committed to lifetime celibacy for the sake of the kingdom. But a monastery, which is a place where monks live. I think the most historic way to think about what a monastery is. It is a place where men or women who are committed to singleness for the sake of kingdom work live to find community and encouragement that empowers the neighbors, their kingdom work that keeps them spiritually and mentally and emotionally healthy. And it's also a place to find family, to find community because we're all made for family in the body of Christ. And some people's domestic family, so to speak, domestic church is oriented around a nuclear family. But historically in the church for those the most common way that people called to celibacy for the sake of the kingdom found family was in something like a monastery. So we have started kind of a modern version of that in Nashville, Tennessee. So there's six of us who live in a house together. And we are still a part of different local churches. We are still connected to our biological families and to friends outside of our community. We live in a house together and we pray together every morning before work. And we have a certain number of family meals together each week. And we do confession with each other. And we have a time of monthly worship and prayer together and we go on vacations together. And we do the big holidays together. We alternate Thanksgiving's and Christmas is with our national family of brothers and with our biological families. We live according to a common kind of community covenant. As we are all discerning, whether God might be calling us to make lifetime commitments to vocational sing on us and to this brotherhood. And as we're each discerning, how God is calling us to leverage our availability and vocational sing on us for the sake of kingdom work. So in some ways extraordinary. But in other ways, it's just the place where we find family. It's just where we spend our lives and where we spend our holidays and where we spend our vacations. So yeah, in other ways, very ordinary. Yep. I love that. That sounds like a very healthy community. Okay, so Peter, what have you been set free from? I have been set free from a couple of things. I've been set free from shame of my of my same sex attractions and shame of struggling with sexual addiction. I'll start with that. And to be clear, I'm not saying that either of those are good. When I say that when I'm sitting in a positive that I've been set free from shame around those things, I'm not saying that those things, same sex attractions or struggling with sexual addiction, are God's intentions or that they're good. I think those are brokenness in my life, the same sex attractions, the struggling with sexual addiction. But for a long time, I thought it was like my fault that I was broken in those ways. And I thought it was my job to find some way to make those go away. In that if I failed to make them go away, God wouldn't love me anymore. And thankfully, I have been set free from this. Every day, I submit those broken parts of myself to Jesus. And I ask Jesus to help me obey his wisdom. And I take practical steps that mentors have offered me to make it easier for me to make make wise choices. So I'm stewarding those according to God's wisdom daily. And I'm set free from shame around the fact that around the idea that those are my fault or I'm doing something wrong if I haven't found a way to eliminate those completely all by myself. But also say, I have been set free from romance idolatry. And I think that's really important to my story and maybe to a need a lot of people. You know, I mean, everything about the world around me, like tells me that I need romance and sex to be happy, that I need those things to be a whole person. And that's not just from cultural Christianity, right? Like it's also from all of the Christian and secular spaces that advocate for a more progressive sexual ethic, right? Like in my estimation, my experience, both extremes in kind of like a sexual ethics conversation, tell me that if only I found the right person, I wouldn't experience lonely in a sense of understanding more. And that magical romantic connection is the best way to secure stable family. And I think those are lies. Like the scriptures don't teach that. The scriptures don't bear that out. Like scientific statistics about relationships in the West don't bear that out. Like so yeah, now I see that the idol of romance, it lies and it over promises. And then instead the scriptures and the practices of the early church actually tell the truth, that I don't need romance or sex. But I do need lifelong lived in companionship. And I can get that invocational singleness in the context of committed, intentional Christian community. I can get that just as much as the next person. So yeah, set free from romance, idolatry, set free from shame, of struggling with sexual addiction, set free from shame around my same sex attractions. That's awesome. And I think that I think that most people can relate to at least one part of your story of like whether it's same sex attraction or it's just romantic idolatry because it is everywhere. It's like, how would you not pick that message up in our culture? Yeah. But um, and I'm pretty sure that everyone at least in the US knows someone who would identify as not straight. Right. Yeah. It's it's everywhere. And I long for the day to just receive over and over again, redemption after redemption of people realizing that whatever their attraction is, that's not what defines them. So I love what we're talking about today. It's going to be about being a win some witness. What a surprise is the first part. Yes, I want to be a win some witness in every area of my life. But what have you seen is the most common roadblock to being a win some witness to someone who is in the LGBTQ plus community? Yeah. Let's see. Common roadblocks. I think kind of particularly for Christians who hold a historic sexual ethic as I've described. And are trying to share the gospel with non-Christians? I think some some big roadblocks are kind of the the felt need to defend the church as perfect. Like I think a lot of Christians get defensive and feel like in order to defend a historic sexual ethic we have to we can't admit any fault by Christians. I think another roadblock is maybe like being confused about what they actually believe about sexual ethics or being confusing like being unclear or maybe like even perpetrating kind of a bait and switch when it comes to what Christians believe. Like I think there's some Christians who think this people might find their beliefs about his story of sexual, historic sexual ethics offensive. So they kind of like actually like hide them and they kind of like give off vibes as if they're like really welcoming and caring and maybe hold a progressive sexual ethic and then when someone gets closer they actually reveal the bay. How do a historic sexual ethic? I think that causes problems. I think some of the roadblocks are maybe like turning a blind eye to kind of the double standard of sexual stewardship in our churches. Like I don't know I think gay people LGBT plus people or like straight allies who have more progressive ethic. I think they see kind of the ways we seem to hold straight people to lower standards of sexual stewardship than we hold gay people to in our churches and that's a big turnoff. That's a big problem. Yeah that's a big problem. Yeah. And maybe the last one is kind of like I don't know if our churches are really doing what it takes to be churches where LGBT plus Christians who even if they wanted to follow God's wisdom they could actually thrive while doing it you know. And I think particularly about like if there's LGBT plus Christians who felt called to walk out celibacy. I don't think anyone looks at any of our churches and sees anybody thriving. And life long, seamless regardless of sexual orientation. So why would we think that's good for LGBT plus Christians? So yeah so I think those are all the things that like make us look ugly honestly and make Jesus's wisdom look ugly to to non Christians. But particularly as it relates to like his story sexual ethics. Yep. I think there's a lot of truth there. Okay so all of those that you listed are kind of like mindsets that people have. So if they're their mindset roadblocks what are some things that people could do to start to overcome those? Yeah so I'm I'm fairly like a formally literate or scientific person so I kind of like diagnosed the problem and in the solution is always just the compliment of the problem you know so so this is going to sound familiar but like I guess my suggestions would be maybe a person is like instead of feeling overly defensive about the church confess the sense of the church right like I'm not asking I'm not saying that people should apologize for or abandon the historical ethics but I think we should be able to recognize and confess the ways that Christians have been complicit in hate crimes over the last century. Propagated ex-gay theology that led to millions of LGBT plus people losing their faith or losing their life over the past century. We can recognize those things we can say even in Jesus that teaches a historic sexual ethic. He did not he mourned he grieved when he saw the church doing those things when we did those things that's not how Jesus would do it. We messed up and we need to confess those things and even if I didn't do those things myself I am part of the the body of believers throughout time and I can confess on behalf of all of us like we messed up. So I think I think we can do that I think I go as a long way. On second one I think like instead of hiding our beliefs doing that kind of bait and switch thing that maybe even have the best intentions for honestly when I talk to LGBT plus people who are not Christians or just generally non-Christians like they want us to just be like honor people by being clear about what we believe about what we think Jesus's wisdom is for LGBT plus people. So I think I think that's important like just we need to be clear you know in a kind way but and be clear. Let's see I think another is like I think we need to take practical steps to show we are serious about Jesus's wisdom like it is not enough to just teach historic sexual ethics. Our churches have to embody that in ways that lead to good and beautiful for gay people. I think leaders in our churches need to seek out training to provide better one-on-one pastoral care to LGBT plus people. I think that our churches need to commit to sharing with every kid before puberty about God's love and wisdom for LGBT plus people so that no kid ever has to go in the closet again and endure the wounds of the closet. I think we can commit to doing that in our churches. I think our churches need to cultivate intentional Christian community in our churches where single people regardless of sexual orientation can find permanent lived in family. I think our churches need to like yeah there needs to be a proof of concept that the Jesus's wisdom as they see it actually leads to more good, more beautiful thriving for gay people. Let's see in contrast to that like that double standard of sexual stewardship we talked about between gay and straight people. I think we need to raise the bar for everyone's sexual stewardship. I think we need to make sure that straight Christians are genuinely discerning between vocational single and Christian marriage. I think we need to make sure that all Christian marriages are faithfully open to the possibility of the kingdom work of raising children. I think all Christian marriages need to take seriously what the Bible really says about unbiblical divorce and remarriage. I think those are the kind of steps that will kind of eliminate this devil's standard or discriminatory application of gods wisdom and prevent a victim mentality among LGBT plus people. Also I think all those things would be good for straight Christians. The point of that is not to just make life harder for straight Christians. I hope that we can look at the divorce rate in our churches and see that the ways we're doing discipleship for straight sexuality is failing straight people. We need something better for straight people too. Everyone is paying a price for us for our churches abandoning Christmastime. So I think that's part of the solution. Then maybe last but not least is like we've got to make sure that the gay Christians, the LGBT plus Christians in our churches that want to follow Jesus' wisdom, we've got to make sure that they're actually thriving. Like I think before our churches do outreach to LGBT plus non-Christians, we got to make sure the LGBT plus Christians in our community that are already committed to historic sexual ethics are experiencing good fruit. I think that looks like gathering with them and mourning the wounds of the closet that they endured. I think it looks like our churches offering theological clarity and kind of promising those LGBT plus Christians committed to a historic sexual ethic that they will stand with them in all the beauty and nuance and complexity that Jesus wisdom is. I think we've got to provide better pastoral to those LGBT plus Christians and I think we've got to make sure that they're finding family in the body of Christ. So none of these, none of these five things I suggested, confess the sins of the church, offer clarity as charity, take practical steps, raise the bar for straight sexuality, help faithful gay Christians thrive. None of those are like cute phrases or like argument tricks we can bring up in conversations with non-Christians. Yeah, none of those are like a bumper sticker. No, no. Yeah, like I'm not, I'm not teaching us I'm not trying to teach people how to convince non-Christians into Jesus in one conversation and get over the hurdle that is their perception of the church and LGBT plus people. What I'm saying here is that like before you expect like okay, over and over again, the different institutions in the West when they poll people who are not Christians and they ask them. What's the number one barrier? What's top five barriers for you to giving Jesus another chance? To getting to know Jesus, to visiting church, consistently what they say, number one answer, their perception of the church's treatment of LGBT plus people. Is what they report, right? Is there number one barrier to getting to know Jesus? Is there perception of how the church treats LGBT plus people? Okay. So what that means is that getting this right, how are churches embody God's love and wisdom for LGBT plus people? Is about much more than just the 10% of people who are LGBT plus, right? Yeah. It is actually that one of the number one barriers to the gospel. So what my suggestion is is before we try to go bring the next generation to Jesus. We need to essentially take the log out of our eye, you know, we there's this huge wall up between them and Jesus and we have to take these practical steps in our churches and it may take a couple years. It may take a generation to tear down this barrier between non-Christians and Jesus that has been built by our reputation of how we treat LGBT plus people made in the image of God. Now in the meantime, share Jesus hope for the Holy Spirit to work miracles and be able to work around this hurdle that the church has created. But also we got to get busy breaking down that hurdle. We got to get busy doing that. Wow, what are you saying is a lot of taking ownership for our own actions that yes, and what is holding people back is their perception of how the church has treated LGBT plus people. And so perception isn't always reality, but your perception will change if you do see something that contradicts what you already assumed. So I'm assuming that the way these conversations go with a professing Christian who maybe has a more progressive sexual ethic and then the conversation with someone who's just not a Christian at all. I'm assuming those conversations go differently. How are they different? How do you approach each one differently? Yeah, so yeah, I mean basically like 100% different. So I mean, the scripture's promises that people who aren't following Jesus are going to find his wisdom foolish, particularly when it comes to sexual ethics. We should not be surprised by that. Like why in the world what a non-Christian had any interest in restricting their options or practices, based on what some guy two thousand years ago said, if they don't believe Jesus is who he said he was, right? Which I think that's the question, like why would an LGBT plus non-Christian ever want to go to a church that affirms his own sexual ethics? You know, because they do, right? I hear from LGBT plus people who are not Christians or LGBT plus Christians who hold a progressive sexual ethic that they still sometimes prefer to go to a church that teaches a historic sexual ethic. Why is that? Well, what I want to notice is their churches that are offering something so compelling that people are willing to kind of stomach as sexual ethics they personally find defenses. But because everything else about the church is so compelling. Because that church is offering family in the body of Christ like nowhere else and an opportunity to serve their community like nowhere else. You know, because I, and I don't think this is too question is unique to gay people. Like, let's let's apply this question more generally. Why would anyone want to be part of a church that calls him or her to inconvenient stewardship of any kind? Right? I think it's that our church is offering something so compelling, so beautiful, that individuals will want to continue to be a part of that church despite aspects they strongly disagree with. So how do we do that? I think we've got to invite them to be a part of a community of believers is more satisfying that can be found anywhere else and invite them to come on mission to redeem the world with us. We've got to have, and we've got to have a posture of like trusting and being patient with the Holy Spirit to reveal what is true to all of us according to the Holy Spirit's timing and and continue to to nurture meaningful relationship there. And at the end of the meantime, our churches can get busy offering something better. So yeah, I think the conversation with LGBT plus non-Christians is basically don't put the cart before the horse. Is focus on Jesus? Like if a person's not a believer yet, I wouldn't even bring up the conversation about sexual ethics or arguments about sexual ethics. Christ wisdom about sexual ethics is going to be a relevant to them until they actually make Jesus their personal Lord and Savior. So I'm just going to talk to them about Jesus. And then one say gets to know, once they're interested in getting to know Jesus and making Jesus the Lord of their life and submitting everything in their life to the Lord of Jesus, then we can get into what some of their sticking points might be about that. But yeah, one thing at a time, you know. Yeah, one thing at a time. So if there's someone who is a Christian who just doesn't believe that point isn't falling a historical sexual ethic, how does that conversation go? Okay, yeah, yeah. So honestly, I kind of think arguing about sexual ethics between Christians is also like a trap. Don't you see? Yes, I think it's kind of like an emotionally loaded distraction from talking about what we really disagree about. Let me explain. So most of the time, if I have come to a different conclusion than someone else about sexual ethics, it is usually the downstream result of disagreement about one of three much more important theological questions. Like if we disagree about sexual ethics, it's really because we disagree about one of the following more important questions. One is there a God? Do we agree or disagree about that? Number two, does that God know what's best for me better than I do? Does that God know what's best for me better than I do? Do we agree or disagree on that question? Number three, is the way we know that God's best for us by reading the Bible with the historic church? Do we discover that God's best for us by reading the Bible with the historic church? Do we agree or disagree on that question? So rarely, rarely do I agree with someone on all three of those questions and yet we come to meaningfully different opinions about sexual ethics. So if you disagree about sexual ethics, my suggestion is instead of getting kind of trapped in emotionally loaded and seemingly really high-stakes conversation about sexual ethics, if you're gonna talk about theology, then instead focus on those three more fundamental questions. Ask each other those questions, see where you probably disagree on those three more fundamental questions, and then talk about those. Talk about whether there's a God, whether that God knows what's best, and how we discover what that God's best is. Talk about those, because those are both, those questions are simultaneously less emotionally loaded, like seemingly less high stakes, but there are actually much more important conversations to have with another believer. Much more consequent, so that's my recommendation. It is, don't argue with other Christians about sexual ethics. Particularly if you don't know yet whether the real reason you disagree is because you disagree about much more much more fundamental things. Sure, that sounds like it takes so much pressure off of those conversations. Yeah, yeah, thank God. Yeah, well, if someone has continually had those conversations with someone who they differ in what they believe about sexual ethic, if that conversation has already come up multiple times, is there any point that we should just stop bringing it up because maybe you're hitting a wall, or, you know, it's nothing in their life has changed yet. Is there a point where you're like, I'm gonna stop being a dead horse? Right. Yeah, I think I think this starts getting into again, I'm maybe a cop out here, but some broader questions about, you know, what's our relationship with this person? What are our personal convictions about Christian accountability? Right, it's one thing, if this is a person who we've gone to the same church with for 10 years that we've been in Bible studies with for 10 years, who for the past 10 years has consistently, you know, invited you to hold them accountable and you have invited them to hold you accountable. There's mutual accountability agreement there. That's one thing. Versus a co-worker who's known for six months, who is also a Christian but goes to a completely different church in town and has never invited you to hold them accountable and you've never invited them to hold you accountable. Right. Right. I just think those are very, very different circumstances. And I think, yeah, it's, I, I, I are on the side of like if we can agree to disagree. If, if you're just a co-worker, if you're just a distant Christian acquaintance on social media, like, you know, but different, you know, if it's someone I've known for 10 years at the same church and we've talked about a mutual accountability. But I also do, there's, there's discernment we've got to do there, you know, and and also I think different churches, a different cultures, cultures around accountability, right. So if, if, if, if whatever is kind of the cultural around mutual accountability, the year church has taught and the both of you seem to have accepted, that's the kind of boundaries of what I think is reasonable in terms of what you can expect in terms of pushing on each other. And yeah, so I think that dictates a lot about what it would be appropriate and at one point we just need to kind of agree to disagree. Now, I think interestingly, like five years ago, this question would much more often be asked in the direction of like, hey, you have a more historic sexual ethic, this other person has a more revisionist sexual ethic or progressive sexual ethic and how much duty do you have to continue to pursue, pursue, pursue this conversation or maybe even have a boundary in your friendship around this that this is a non-starter if you can't come to the same place about this. And almost like there was a, it was almost asking like at what point does the conservative Christian cancel the other Christian, right. I think these days, the dynamic is kind of flipped if anything, right. I think a lot of times it's these days it's Christians who hold a more historic sexual ethic who are saying, don't cancel me, don't abandon our friendship. Let's just keep talking or we don't have to talk about it anymore at all. We can agree to disagree and it's often in my experience the Christian who holds a more progressive sexual ethic who is really weighing whether or not they're willing to continue in friendship with me at all if I won't agree with them on a progressive sexual ethic. I don't know if that's your experience, but I think that the table has turned there. And so for those of us who hold a historic sexual ethic, these days it's a lot more a conversation of being maybe prepared to get canceled by our friends who hold a progressive sexual ethic because we're not willing to join them in that place. But it doesn't give us permission to be rude to be clear. It doesn't give us permission to be assholes, you know. Right. But yeah, that's kind of sucky, you know. Yeah, and maybe your friendship does change. Maybe it's not full canceling, but maybe you need to be prepared to have that friendship change a little bit, not always, but sometimes. Are you someone who wants to learn how to minister to people who are same sex attracted? Or let me phrase it another way. If a student, a friend or a co-worker came up to you and needed to confide in you about this tension they live in every day. Would you know what to say? I've created a free training on how to minister to those wrestling with LGBTQ plus issues, and you could finish it in less than half an hour. This training will teach you how to meet people right where they're at using biblical truths and deep empathy. We'll talk about what to say, as well as what not to say, how to encourage and love when you don't have all the answers, and how to point them back to the one who loves more perfectly and more completely than anyone else can. So if you're thinking, say no more Jenny, where do I sign up? All you have to do is click the link in the show notes and it'll be delivered right to your inbox. And so with that, let's jump back into your episode. I really appreciate how you take it on a basis by basis. Okay, because everyone is different and it's completely different if you view yourself as like the savior who's supposed to convince someone of the correct sexual epic if they've never invited you to hold the accountable to that. Yeah, yeah. Do you have any resources you'd recommend on this topic? Yeah, so specifically when it comes to sharing the gospel with LGBT plus people and discussing various perspectives on sexual ethics and how to become a church where LGBT plus people can belong and thrive according to historic sexual ethics. I check out a quick shameless plug. It's the ministry that I help run and we have, you know, for over 10 years we've trained 30,000 plus Christian leaders to better love LGBT plus people at more than 100 churches and universities. So yeah, you can learn more and check out a lot of free resources at our website, which is equipyourcommunity.org. Otherwise, honestly, the best way to kind of stay connected with me or ask me a question is to connect with me on socials. I'm at my first name and then my middle initial L and then my last name on all platforms. So that's at PIETERL VALK or you can connect with me on my website, which is PeterLValk.com, PIETERLVALK.com. So yeah and on both of those places you'll also find kind of some general book recommendations and other kind of resources out there, you know, thankfully we're in a generation where the church is really approaching these topics, and a much more nuanced way where we are holding on to both, I think, empathy and orthodoxy, grace and truth when it comes to this conversation. And I hope that the church, I hope that a critical mass of the church continues to hold on to both of those. And I think I hope we do that long enough to see the good and beautiful fruit that comes from holding on to both of those because it could be really great, really great for LGBT plus people. And then as we've noted because of the ways perceptions about the church and LGBT plus people impacts the gospel. I think if we can hold on to both grace and truth and bear that out in good and beautiful fruit in our lifetime, we can also see the impact that has on the gospel for a lot more people than just LGBT plus people. I would love to to live to see that. Yeah, I will link all of those in the show notes so any listener can find them. Peter, I'm just very curious. What does the L for your meal name stand for? Lock. Really? Yes, LOCKE, like John Lock, the philosopher. Yeah, and like have you seen the show lost? I have. There's a lot in there too. I just said that. I have to do. Yes, yes, I'll find a little bit about that. I always thought, like, oh, if I get married, if I had a kid, and if I have a kid, he's a dude, I would love to name him. I would love to like him to go by lock. But then I watched that show and it kind of like really. The name for me. Like, well, I guess there's other names out there. Go to the honors. Yeah, the kind of room. That's funny. Well, thank you so much Peter because your wisdom is is very needed right now. And you're right. I am very hopeful for the future that the church is learning, you know, slowly, but surely how to have these conversations, how to be authentic. So thank you for being a part of that. Yeah, thank you so much for the opportunity. And I'm just grateful that like this is the the work that Jesus called me to and that I, yeah, I thought because of the brokenness in my life, my story was done for and quite the opposite. Jesus has used it to do beautiful and amazing things beyond what I ever couldn't imagine. So yeah, super grateful. Thank you so much for listening to this episode of Head to Her Podcast. It's a joy to record them and a joy to have you listen. Since you're a dedicated listener and made it to the very end of the episode, I have two gifts for you. One is that I have a free resource linked in the show notes for you. It's a resource created to help you take the truth you've learned either in this episode or in a previous one and apply it to your life. The second gift I have for you is access to my seasonal playlist. Every season, summer, fall, winter spring, I create a regular playlist and a worship playlist that will be ongoing throughout the season and you'll be able to follow it on Spotify if you need some good buggy tunes. Because let's be honest, in another life, I would have been a DJ. So you now have full access to me all your seasonal music needs in the show notes. As always, I'd love hearing from you. So follow me on Instagram and send me a DM of how this episode impacted you. The handle is head to heart underscore podcast. And if you would be so kind, leave if five star rating and review on Spotify, Apple podcasts or the website. By doing this, you'll help me get more amazing guests on the show in the future. I'll be releasing new episodes to you every other Friday. So stay tuned and thanks for joining us.
