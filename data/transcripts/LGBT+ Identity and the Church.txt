 You're eyes on the times you walk ready to speak up, but with so many problems you're exhausted trying to keep up. This is the church politics podcast where you can get political commentary from a biblical world view. We're not trying to be conservative or progressive, we're trying to be Christian in the public square. And I'm like a seven, I'm meeting God's image, nobody can change my settings. Hey man, cut off my knees and put it into my search. Cause easy to sell your soul when you don't know what it's worth. Which you know good and camp you're listening to the Ann campaign's church politics podcast with Justin Gibbany aka Bishop Cooper's grandson. And the Wendy city represented the baddest brother above the Mason Dixon line. My play cousin the right reverent. Christopher Butler. Okay, Christopher Butler is not here and I got some sad news. Chris has been fired from the church politics podcast. Reason being he just refused to be the co-host that I wanted him to him to be. He refused to agree with me on every single issue and pander to everything I said and so I just had to let him go. All right, I'm kidding. Chris is still with us. He's just not with us today. All right, he's not he's not getting fired, but I figured I would scare some of y'all just to wake you up before this very important conversation. I'm about to have now so I'm really excited about this conversation. So I'm gonna get all the pleasantries out the way so we can get to our special guest Peter Volk. Really excited about this conversation is going to be about LGBTQ matters and I think you need to hear it. All right. So let me first say I think everybody who's been supporting the anti campaign. We appreciate you. You know how we feel about you do not forget that the theme song for this year for the church politics podcast, but also as first ever revival is our greens everything's going to be all right. If you haven't not been bumping that in your car or on the bus and your headphones, you need to go ahead and put that on several of your playlists. All right. That's the song for this year. All right. I want to give a shout out to all our patrons and supporters for supporting us in what we do and how we do it. If you're watching on YouTube remember to like and subscribe. Very important. You know how these these social media things go. We got to make sure people are liking it so that we can get into more feeds. I know how the algorithm is. Help the brother out and let's make that happen. All right. So again, this is a very important conversation and a very serious conversation. I'm going to treat it that way. So as always, grab your Bible, get your mind right and prepare to think. Not like a Republican, not like a Democrat, but to think like a Christian and I want to start with some scripture. I want to start with Luke 15 versus one through seven. All right. And it says this is the NIV. It says now the task collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, this man welcomed sinners and eats with them. Then Jesus told them this parable. Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country and go after the law sheep until he finds it. And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, Rejoice with me, I have found my lost sheep. I tell you that in the same way, there will be more rejoicing and have an over one sinner who repeats. And over 99 righteous persons will be not repent. But remember at the beginning, he says that the Pharisees said, this man welcomed sinners and eats with them. And I say all that to say, thank you to my guest for fellow shipping with me, a sinner. And my guest is very special. I think he's talking about an issue that we all need to address. His name is Peter Volk. Peter is a speaker slash author on vocational singleness and LGBT plus topics according to a biblical sexual ethic. The executive director of E. Quip, a Christian ministry that trains leaders around LGBT plus topics. He's a co-founder of the Nashville family of brothers and economically Christian modern monastery. He's a teacher aspiring deacon in the ACNA and a licensed professional counselor. He helps churches love gay people and celibate Christians find family. You can follow him at Peter Volk. And learn more about him at PeterLVolk.com. And we'll have that in our show notes just so you all can follow him. Peter, thank you so much for joining me today, man. Yeah, thanks for having me on the podcast. I'm really grateful. Yeah, man, I mean, you've been gracious to me because we're supposed to do this a while ago and I just kept fumbling the ball. But I'm glad that we got here. And it's it's a topic that I think our audience really needs to hear. And I just want to be very honest with you when it comes to this LGBT plus conversation. I think that the church has failed in so many ways. Right. You have one part of the church that was just very for years, very very harsh towards this community. And I rejected them to not show compassion in the way that we are supposed to. And I think unless we're willing to reckon with that failure and we're willing to enter into this conversation with a broken heart. Then we won't get this right. Then you have another part of the church that just said, hey, let's just affirm it, go along with whatever, you know, pop culture kind of puts out there. It's good because we want to be compassionate. We don't want anybody to feel hurt. And I just feel like we've gotten it wrong. But one thing I also know is that I personally just in giving me. I don't have the answers, right. And so I really do see somebody like you as a resource for me as I try to be faithful while maintaining, while correcting some of the major mistakes that Christians have made in the past. So again, thank you for joining us. First of all, Peter, just tell us a little bit about yourself, your journey and what you do. Yeah, so you, yeah, you shared about a couple of the things that I do in my life and my day job and outside of my job and each of those have to do with sexuality and finding belonging in the body of Christ. I'm a different kind of works kingdom works matter to me because I'm a Christian and I'm gay. I experience same sex attraction. And I'm committed to that historic biblical sexual ethic. And let me just clarify when I say at least like historic sexual ethic, biblical historical sexual ethic, what do I mean by that? I mean a belief that God's best for every Christian is either what's some vocational, singleness, which is the kind of singleness that Jesus talks about in Matthew 19 and Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 7, which is a lifetime vocation of abstinence, singleness for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention. Or God's best is Christian marriage, which Christians have historically understood to be a lifetime vocation of opposite sex Christian marriage. For the purposes of a lot of things, but including an openness to the kingdom work of raising children together. And yeah, I grew up in kind of cultural Christianity and rural northeast Tennessee and the 90s and by the time that I noticed that I experienced the same sex attractions. I had heard a steady diet of pretty kind of homophobic and problematic things in the environment around me as well as people teaching what the Scriptures have to say about God's wisdom for everyone's sexuality, including those who experience same sex attraction. So I experienced that extreme, maybe of us of a solution or a mischap and understanding God's love and wisdom for LGBT plus people. Fast forward to today, many churches and many cultural spaces outside of our churches. I feel this other pressure to abandon God's wisdom in the Scriptures and find fullness of life somewhere else. And the challenge for my journey has been, how do I walk a middle way between those two? How do I hold tightly to God's wisdom in the Scriptures and how do I, if there's going to be enduring persisting broken to some my life, how do I submit that to the Lord and steward of that of ways that brings glory to God and embrace goodness to my life. And in many ways that inspires and is the foundation of a lot of the work that I do. And who would you say so or some of your influencers as you try to figure this out who kind of helped you along the way think to it. Yeah, so for a lot of people maybe in my generation plus or minus a couple of years. There was actually kind of a gap in terms of help to make sense of this because just as I was coming up age and getting to the end of my teens and early 20s was when the kind of exodus international prey the gateway movement wasn't floating. And so all of the maybe wisdom and mentorship that a person might have found from that space was gone. But something new to replace that had not yet been built yet. And so a big part of my story actually was in high school and in college was, you know, grasping in the dark to find someone who could help me make sense of this part of my story. Hoping that my parents or a password or campus minister would know more about this stuff than I then I had to discover through my own personal experience and could help me figure out what does it look like to submit my broken sexuality to Jesus and stood in a way that brings glory to God and goodness to my life. And I think the biggest challenge was there was no one like the biggest resource I had was I. Yeah, I went to Vanderbilt University and I was in a Christian fraternity and at one point kind of I felt compelled to share my testimony. It at our one of our fraternity meetings and I can ended up connecting after that with a number of other guys who had a similar story and convictions and had never shared with anyone else. And they were really to help the people who helped me make sense of this part of my story were just other people who were just as lost as me, but at least we had the same problem with the same challenge. And we could try to figure out to pray and discern together what God's wisdom was for us. Thankfully, that's not true today. You know, thankfully there are ministries like a quip that I hope lead in other ministries that are equipping pastors and parents to disciple Christians who experience same sex attraction and gender and congruence. But yeah, those resources didn't exist. You know a decade ago of 20 years ago. Wow. So to help me understand, help our audience understand, let's dig into a little bit what it means to be same sex attraction, to sell a bit and how that ties into your definition of vocational singleness. Like let's dig into what that means for somebody coming from your perspective. Yeah, so maybe kind of one morning during puberty when most of my guy friends woke up and suddenly started seeing girls their age in a different way. And then I was just going to be drawing to them physically wanting to connect with them romantically. Well, that morning I woke up and instead felt the same thing for other gods. And I didn't have anything to do with bringing that about, nor did my parents, but I also don't think it was God's intention. Like I think experiencing same sex attraction and being tempted to lust after other men, I think it's a brokenness. A product of the fall. And I think none of us are how God intended us to be. I think all of us are wounded by this broken world we're born into, including our sexuality, you know, all of our sexualities are broken. But for whatever reason, the particular way that the brokenness of the world impacted me was that I developed these same sex attractions. But also to be clear, you know, merely experiencing same sex attraction isn't a sin. Like it isn't a sin to be tempted by something. We commit sin when we say yes to a temptation in thought word or deed. And yeah, and then despite the fact that I tried for like a decade to eliminate my same sex attractions, that just doesn't seem to be the way things work either. You know, I mean, certainly God has the power to do whatever he wants, okay, but scientific research shows that 96% of people who try to change their same sex attractions experience no change in their attractions. But those efforts do lead to like a doubling of the risk of suicide. So, so eliminating same sex attractions and developing robust general opposite sex attractions where they previously were not. That kind of happens at the level of a miracle. So certainly we can pray for miracles and God does miracles. But the story of kind of the thorn in Paul's flesh, I think to me, seems to instruct us that maybe we shouldn't wait around for a miracle, you know, but instead ask God, you know, hey, God, if this brokenness continues. How do you want me to steward this for your glory and for my good and for me. And part of my answer to that question has been to commit to celibacy, you know, and and these days a lot of people have a lot of different definitions of celibacy like I think I recently read about a celebrity who said she was going sell a bit for a season. Which for her meant no romantic relationships. Physical only one night stands and focusing on herself. So the world times didn't strike definitions, right? So you may be to clarify what I mean when I say celibacy, you know, historically Christians have understood celibacy to be a permanent giving up of romance dating marriage sex or biological children. To instead use ones availability in celibacy to serve the poor and the needy in our city with all of our attention and focus and energies. So so so being same sex attracted and celibate for me isn't too different than my exclusively opposite sex attracted friends who are committed to celibacy. That's right. I'm resisting temptations to a different, do different people than than they are, but we're both refraining from romance or dating or sex and resisting temptations lost after me. Let me ask you this because you brought it up in such an important issue. A lot of people who I know and I think they're doing this out of the goodness of their or feel like they're doing this out of the goodness of their heart started being affirming of the LGBTQ lifestyle based on the idea that if you don't affirm people who are same sex attracted. Delicumant suicide. Like that's been a very strong narrative and I think a lot of people have said, wow, I certainly don't want that to happen, so it'd be better if I just affirm. So what do you say to people who kind of who say that, but also why does affirmation not equal love? Sure. Yeah, so I think some of the challenge here is we can there's actually more than just two perspectives, theological perspectives on like what God's love. And like what God's love and wisdom is for LGBT plus people. And so one perspective, you know, maybe as a gay affirming perspective, if you want to use that or a progressive sexual ethic or pro gay marriage theology. But then the other two options, I think we need to distinguish between kind of a prey the gay away ex- gay theology versus a compassionate. And so if we if we tease out those three, they're absolutely is research that demonstrates the prey the gay away theology that ex- gay theology leads to an increased risk of suicide and loss of faith in the lives of LGBT plus people who try to walk that path. That is absolutely true, you know. Also say that anecdotally, I have a lot of friends who are gay and Christian and adopt a pro gay marriage theology. And five or 10 years down the road, very few of them call themselves Christians anymore. So there's a way and that's a much more delicate complicated conversation, but but it seems like gay affirming or a pro gay marriage theology leads to loss of faith in the lives of the gay Christians that adopt. So it seems to me that like both extremes lead to loss of faith. The ex- gay theology on an wanting extreme also leads to loss of life. But in the middle way between these two extremes, there's a compassionate historic biblical sexual ethic. And there's not a ton of research about that path, that pathway and what kind of spiritual health and mental health that leads to, but at least the preliminary research that's been done by Mark Yarr House and others. Demonstrates that actually gay Christians who try to walk that middle way of holding on to biblical wisdom, but recognizing that pray the gay ways, not the solution. Experience, equivalent mental health outcomes to the average American, so they're healthy compared to the average American. And the ex-experience greater life satisfaction than the average American. So I think I would just push back on the idea that like, God's wisdom embodied in the way that Jesus would really want us to embody it for LGBT plus people. It doesn't lead to suicide or loss of faith. And it doesn't require us to throw away the wisdom and the scriptures that actually, the statistics show that the pathway that leads to most spiritual and mental health is following God's wisdom and embodying it in a gracious compassionate loving way. So it sounds like maybe the issue isn't that some people aren't being affirmed in their, maybe their lifestyle or their accepting of, there be, you know, a behavior that accepts kind of the LGBT lifestyle. But it's that they weren't being shown compassion. So yeah, if you say, no, I don't necessarily affirm you and then you show, you revile that person and you reject them. Then yeah, you're pushing them into into a space where they don't feel any belonging. But if you say, I can't affirm you because of what the Bible says, but I love you. And I'm just as broken as you are. And I want to walk with you. That may be the cure instead of just saying, I have to affirm you see there is either hate or affirm and that's a false dichotomy that we see a lot in our society. And I think that we need to break and that I think it kind of can dismantle that narrative that's it's either suicide or complete affirmation. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. All right, man, that that is our first segment. We will be right back with Peter Valk on the church politics podcast. You're eyes on the times you walk ready to speak up, but with so many problems you're exhausted trying to keep up. This is the church politics podcast where you can get political commentary from a biblical world view. We're not trying to be conservative or progressive. We're trying to be Christian in the public square. And I'm like a seven, I'm made in God. I'm in nobody can change my settings. And man, cut off my knees and put it into my search. Because he's it is so you're so when you don't know what it's worth. And we are back on the church politics podcast. This is your host, Justin Gibbany. Chris is not with us today, but he will be back. I was just joking about firing him. But we are here with Peter Valk, who's been a friend of the Anne campaign. He's in Nashville and has really helped me personally think through the LGBT plus conversation. Now while I, you know, we've talked I definitely appreciate you. You continue to help me through this and to relate to people that I'm around. One thing that I'm we probably still disagree on is same sex attractive Christians calling themselves gay. For my perspective and I know there was a kind of diversity with Tim Keller on this and all that, but from my perspective, I'm not I kind of think, Well, do we want to identify with something that you said is brokenness? And what is the result of kind of identifying with brokenness? What's your response to that perspective? Yeah, yeah. So I totally appreciate the concern and I mean the words we use matter as believers, the words we use matter. And I've written kind of a comprehensive kind of essay about why I use the word gay for evangelistic purposes, so maybe we can add that to the to the show notes, but briefly what I'll say is When I say the word gay, some people and maybe some people of some older generations or maybe a certain kind of cultural Christianity context, they assume that gay means Assuming same-sex romantic relationships that gay means a certain opinion about biblical wisdom or about god altogether, I can think about even more probably problematic stereotypes that I grew up with around what the word gay meant. And so for those people, the word gay complies all this extra baggage, all this assumptions about what it means, and so they would prefer for people to just use the phrase same-sex attraction. Because that's, you know, in their minds, oh, the word same-sex attraction, the word phrase same-sex attraction is self-evidence, it doesn't have extra baggage and it's clear why don't we just use that, okay. Whereas there are some other people who when I use the phrase same-sex attraction, they strongly associate that phrase with the gay way movement. And it actually has a lot of baggage. And particularly for kind of older maybe generations of LGBT plus people, but even younger generations, I mean if you get on LGBT plus TikTok queer TikTok gay TikTok today, there are videos that are teaching the new, the younger generation of LGBT plus people that if you hear a Christian in particular use the phrase same-sex attraction, that's a red flag that they're going to send you to pray the gay way can run away from them. So there's an educating of the next generation of LGBT plus people who will never directly experience the ex-gay stuff in the same ways that it existed in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s, but they're being taught, stay away from Christians who use the phrase same-sex attraction. And so, if I go to a lot of, talk to a lot of middle schoolers today, for example, and I ask them, what is the word gay mean? They would say, oh, a boy who likes boys or a girl who likes girls. Nothing more. No assumptions about their theology or philosophy or whether they're pursuing relationships or interrelationship or anything. So I think the challenge, just the challenge with this conversation is that both the word gay and the phrase same-sex attraction are unclear and carry-backage. Like there's no word or term I could use with every audience that is free of baggage and communicates clearly. There's no perfect term to minister to LGBT plus non-Christians and gay teens in your church and straight culture wars in your church. There's no perfect term. And so I choose to use the word that's most effective with gay teens and then I choose to make clear what I mean with the people in the audience who might be put off by that. And why is that? Well, I mean, we know that gay teens are five times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers. We know that LGBT plus youth who are religious are 40% more likely to attempt suicide than non-religious LGBT plus peers. We know that gay teens from highly rejecting families are like eight times more likely to attempt suicide than their LGBT plus peers. And we know that like 54% of LGBT plus people who grew up on the church have left the church. And so for those reasons, I really want to use whatever language terminology verbalji is most effective with teens with young adults with the next generation. And then ask those who might find the word gay, might find the word gay to be difficult for them, ask them to give me some grace and give me a chance to clarify with them what I mean when they use that when I use that word. I think it's also important to distinguish between using the word gay like phenomenal logically versus onphologically. And by that I mean like when we define something phenomenologically. We're naming something based on one's experience or what it appears to be. We're describing it from the outside. In contrast, when we ask who a person is ontologically. We're asking who they are in lately like by design. So I just want to clarify that when I use the word gay, I'm not saying that I or someone else is ontologically gay. I'm not saying that I am fundamentally a different person or that God designed me to be gay. I'm merely noticing that I'm attracted to other people at the same sex and using, in my opinion, kind of the best word, just described that experience. So yeah, ultimately for me using the word gay in the context that I do my work, which is often trying to kind of convince teams and young adults not to give up on God's wisdom for all of our sexualities. I think part of using that word is a part of the way that I share with God's. I say I'm a Christian and I'm gay and I'm convinced that God calls all Christians to vocational, sing on us or Christian marriage. I'm first a child of God foremost. Jesus and Jesus alone sits on the throne of my life and I experience same sex attraction. And that has significantly impacted my journey and how I see the world and it's connected me with others who have similar experiences. And I feel connected with people in the past who have had similar experiences. And I think I had something to offer the church particularly because of those experiences. So yeah, I use the word gay to identify with people of similar experiences. I don't use the word gay to identify with same sex attractions or with sin, but yeah, it's complicated. It's complicated. No, that was actually a very hopeful explanation, probably the best explanation I've heard of that and so I appreciate it. Peter, one of the things that gets me about this controversy and and I think Christians really need to focus in on is how it's framed as them versus us. Right. So for a lot of Christians who have caught up in the culture war, it's our families, our this are that versus those LGBT plus people over there. When it seems to me the truth of the matter, if we're going to be honest, it's us, it's all us. Right. There's no us versus them. People with, you know, that are in the LGBT plus community are in our homes, our family members are I mean, no, no family is completely separated. No church is completely separated from that. And so one thing that I want to help the church do is get rid of the them versus us like this is an us problem. And we all need to address it. And I think in a recent controversy, this kind of weird, it's ugly head again. So pastor Alister Begg is a very well known, I believe, reformed evangelical Christian a lot of reform grows. And I'm like, he's one of those guys that's your most conservative Christian would go to and say, hey, this guy's theology is great, right. And I think he's a star in those circles and I'll be honest with you. I'm not one of those people that says I can't listen to somebody who's why evangelical and reformed I listen to Alister Begg preach, I don't think he can preach and I think he does have to eat as an excellent job most of the time. And I think I asked a question, I think by like a grandmother, something who had a transgender grand son or daughter, I can't remember which one was. And who was getting married and she asked him should she go to the ceremony. And pastor Begg said, you know, for one, he kind of set up the context is they make sure that he knows how you feel about this, right, like be very clear and where you stand when it comes to the gospel and when it comes to doctrine on this not being right or as you put it, this not being God's best for us. But then he said, once that is very clear, then I think you should go and maybe even bring them a gift because it would be the compassionate thing to do and it's probably not what your grandson or daughter would expect you to do. That blue, I mean the last week or so of a social media in those kind of reforms, basis, whatever has been pretty crazy because people were trying to count I mean this is the last guy I would have thought would get canceled by you know they conservative, you know, very conservative evangelical. And I think they were quick to almost cancel them and I think what they miss I want to hear what you think about this, but I think what they miss even if you don't agree with them. I think what they this whole thing is set up like, oh, if you do that you're giving the other side and inch and they're going to take a mile it's not the other side everything's not about the other side like. I think set up as a culture war battle is really hurtful now I understand why some people would say no you're just going to push people in affirmation you got to be very clear when you do something like that I get why people are weary of it, but I also think you guys are making this as a dim versus us and it has to be different what what your thoughts on that controversy. I mean I think we need to treat sacred what God treats sacred and I think it's really important for Christians to be consistent and I think we should maintain relationship where we can. But doing all three of those can be can be tricky I mean okay so. God seems to have defined pretty narrowly what Christian marriage is like what the kind of marriage that God joins in sustains in a unique way. God is to find that narrowly and yeah I believe there's no context for same sexual or romantic activity in the scriptures that God bless is like I'm convinced that same sexual and romantic activities are sins in any context so God. God would never bless a gay marriage so if I believe that God is not joining a couple in Christian marriage. Then I can't testify otherwise right I can't lie so if two self-professed Christians are getting married in a church and using Christian marriage vows. And they're asking me to officiate or they're asking you to play some significant role in the ceremony that unavoidably communicates that I. To indicate something that I know to be false then I can't do that. You know but I think it's a big difference between two non Christians of the same sex getting married in a field without invoking God. Versus two Christians of the same sex quoting scripture and using a Christian marriage liturgy in a church and I mean historically like Christian what when we have attended Christian marriages when Christians of attended Christian marriages. We participated in the ceremony liturgy you know we we testify that God is indeed joining the couple in Christian marriage and we're committing to helping that marriage thrive. And so it it our participation even attendance it says something it matters you know so at least in practice for me what this means is that like. I feel comfortable attending some non Christian same sex weddings on that one extreme in the field without naming God you know that I described. Whereas it's a lot harder when I'm invited to the weddings of like two Christians of the same sex because me it's a fundamentally different question of what I'm testifying to. And and if I decide I can't attend I do try to explain my decision in a way that honors and cares for people and I go to great links to reassure the couple of my love for them that I'm not judging them that I that I just need to respect my own convictions but here's what I really want to say here's the challenge. Most weddings aren't cleanly at one of these extremes like most gay weddings are somewhere along a spectrum between those two hypothetical weddings. So you know each time we get invited to a wedding fall short of God's highest standards. I think we've got a humbly way how our presence might be misinterpreted versus our absence might affect our relationship with the betroth and our potential to have a gospel impact on their future. So even more important than that I think we've got to be consistent like regardless of what you're personally comfortable with along that spectrum. There are a lot of opposite sex weddings that fall just a short of God's vision for Christian marriage. You know if you're invited to a wedding of two non-Christians of the opposite sex. You're invited to the wedding of a Christian and a non-Christian of the opposite sex. You're invited to the wedding of two opposite sex Christians who don't take seriously the biblical purposes of Christian marriage or don't take seriously with the Bible has to say about divorce and remarriage. Like if the opposite sex union you're invited to celebrate fall short of God's design for Christian marriage in their own way. I've challenged you to respond the same ways that you would to a sex couple who's union fall short of God's design for Christian marriage. And I hesitate to attend those weddings too. So I think consistency is key. That's heavy. I mean that's that's really good because I would say I'm probably guilty of not applying that in the same way now that now that I think about it. And my thing was I think there were decent arguments on both sides. I heard Alister Begg's heart and what he was trying to accomplish and for him to get canceled. You're for folks to try to cancel him because he was trying to figure and I was like the problem is you guys aren't trying to figure. So what I hear from you is you might disagree with what he said. But for the people that aren't even that are trying to make it so simple. And if you step over that line this one line there's no new ones there's no nothing you step over this one line you're not one of us anymore you've you've you've given the bad you know you've surrendered to the other side. I think it was such a short sighted interpretation of what he was trying to do at that time. So it was a. Yeah, yeah, if some people if some people are more sensitive to airing on the side of preserving relationship. But then they should air on the side of preserving relationship in every instance some people are going to air on the side of I want to make sure my presence is not misinterpreted right. But then you should apply that in every circumstance and I think my hunch is most of the people who are canceling Alister. If we actually looked at what at some of the opposite sex weddings that they've attended over the last decade they've attended plenty that they would recognize fall short of gods wisdom. And so it doesn't seem like they're standard was really about a care for a sacredness for Christian marriage and God's wisdom and scripture it seemed like there's something else motivating their response. And I would. And I would. But it's interesting to bring that before Jesus. Yeah, and wouldn't it be better to start a conversation with somebody who is otherwise shown that he's committed to scripture. Then they go on social media and try to and try to cancel or put up videos where you're not really representing exactly what he was saying even if you disagree with them. Yeah, we're all making those mistakes as we struggle through something that historically the churches got wrong. Yeah, let's have the conversation I guess that's is where I'm coming from now one thing that I say to people who because there are a lot of critics especially on the right in left of what you're trying to do from the people on the right. Again, I think it's the same thing as we see with this the controversy we just spoke about some people aren't struggling at all to understand now. We know the burden is light when it comes to the gospel, but it's still something that's not necessarily easy for you to do when it comes to your sexuality and you have people who have never made a commitment like that or or fought through anything like that making this too simple. And I always point to even if even me even me and Peter or some of the other folks that have a similar perspective of you disagree on the semantics of it. You got to have an appreciation for the commitment to faithfulness and a sacrifice that a lot of people aren't asked to make. And many of your critics aren't asked to make and so that's my pushback to people on the right tell us a little bit more about the pushback you get from people on the left and how you deal with that. Yeah, sometimes well actually often I think those who have a more progressive perspective on some of these questions it's often motivated because they got LGBT plus loved ones. Who they couldn't tell you the exact details and and plot out the the cause and effect all they know is they got LGBT plus friends. Who wanted to follow Jesus and all Jesus wisdom. And then they're efforts to do so they got burnt out and they got hurt and and and it and they experienced deep shame and it just didn't work for them. And they they're like that that's certainly can't be God solution God solution has got to be something different here let's try this other explanation. And in some ways I really admire their. I admire their motivations those things because they they actually care for LGBT plus people and they're saying it's something is good it's something is true it ought to be good and beautiful and I'm not seeing the good and beautiful. So we got to change something I think that's the right motivations I think they just it's a wrong solution the problem isn't God's wisdom the problem is the way we're we're embody it. But I think in that as maybe some of my pushback to those who hold a more progressive sexual ethic is yeah let's let's look at the the results let's look at the you know the proofs in the putting. And I think it's a progressive sexual ethic doesn't seem to be working out well for a lot of LGBT plus Christians long term either. And I think actually this middle way of like holding on a biblical truth, but but also recognizing that pray the gay away is not the solution is actually in some ways the hardest path it it's the path that calls all of us in the church to the most. It's not it's not the it's not the shortcut solution it's the real big rich robust but hard to build solution right and one thing for example and this connects to what you said previously about the burden some people are called to. And a lot of our churches a lot of parents they hope that their kids get married. For a lot of reasons one of them is that most of us grew up in churches where we never saw anyone walking out lifetime single list and thriving in. Right parents are like we're also what's in the scriptures I want my kid to be happy I think my kid will be miserable if they're single. Okay well if you recognize the statistics that pray the gay away doesn't work for gay people. But you but you believe that God's wisdom says that gay marriage isn't good for gay people. But the only option left for a lot of gay people is to walk out cello to see yeah you wouldn't you wouldn't put that on your own kids. So what are we doing to make our churches places where someone could walk out lifetime single list and thrive in it regardless of sexual orientation gay or straight I don't care who you're attracted to. But very few of our churches our places where anyone could walk out lifetime single list and find a kind of family in the body of Christ they. So our church needs to get busy doing teaching with the scriptures actually have to say about Jesus. And becoming places where people could actually live Jesus single list for a lifetime and find belonging and fullness of life in that. Peter let me hold you right there because you have a lot to say there and I want you to be able to say it all let's go to this break and we'll come back. And ask the question what should the church do to make people in your situation feel that sense of belonging and giving them what they need to walk that out we will be right back on the church politics podcast. Your eyes on the times you walk ready to speak up but with so many problems you're exhausted trying to keep up. This is the church politics podcast where you can get political commentary from a biblical world view. We're not trying to be conservative or progressive we're trying to be Christian in the public square. And I'm black and seven. I'm meeting God's image nobody can change my sentence and man cut off my knees and put it into my search because easy to sell your soul when you don't know what it's worth. And we are back on the church politics podcast is just in Gibny I'm here with Peter Volk and we are talking about being Christian and being in the LG. BT plus community. Now Peter you're very passionate about this I appreciate that man and that's why we have you on. I want to ask a very practical question and you were getting to it right before the break. If I'm the leader of a church or part of church leadership. What can I do practically to make people like yourself feel comfortable and be able to walk out this vocational singleness in a way that's you know flourishing. Yeah. Yeah. So the maybe five suggestions but I only talk about three of them because two of them are probably obvious to the average pastor or Christian leader. You need to teach with. Teach about God's love and wisdom for LGBT plus people in ways that are careful and in ways that are true and some churches are trying to step into that. So yes do more of that. And you've got to be able to offer good one on one pastor, pastoral care to any people who experience same sex attraction or gender and congruence in your community. Keep doing that. I think those two things are probably pretty obvious to a Christian leader. Three other things maybe blind spots but that are the big areas of growth. One is that. One of the biggest barriers to long term thriving for LGBT plus Christians is that most of people spend five or ten years. In the closet. Making sense of their sexuality alone with the lives of the enemy and the lives of culture. Man, accruing these wound anxiety and depression and suicide, alien unhealthy coping mechanisms occurring all these wounds of the closet. And by the time they finally share with the parent or pastor, even if they decide to keep on following God's wisdom, they are being they are being weighed down by these wounds of the closet and as a therapist who cares for that population. I would say many of them are will spend decades trying to undo those wounds of the closet. And so a big thing a lot of our churches could do is to prevent those wounds of the closet. It's to make sure that every kid before puberty knows about God's love and wisdom for LGBT plus people in age appropriate ways. So that as soon as any kid notices that this might be a part of their story, they share with a parent or pastor. And they make sense of this with their love and wisdom of Jesus embodied in their parents and parents. So that's one big step on it. We got a quick parents to have age appropriate conversation with their kids before puberty about this stuff. Second thing is that I think a big barrier is kind of there's a double standard around kind of sexual stewardship and accountability in our churches. We've already talked about it a little bit today, but there's some ways that we maybe we hold straight Christians just seemingly a higher standard of sexual stewardship than gay Christians. And I think we need a level that playing field because because when it's when it's unequal, it can easily lead to kind of a victim mentality in the eyes and the hearts of LGBT plus people that make it easier for them to throw away God's wisdom. But I don't think the solution is to lower everyone's standard of sexual stewardship. I think the solution actually is to raise this standard for everyone's sexual stewardship. What's really key to what the Scriptures have to say about vocational, and about unbiblical divorce and remarriage. And let's have real conversations about how lies, casual romance and dating outside of marriage is. And all these kinds of things like, let's take with the Scriptures have to say about everyone's sexuality seriously. I think that'll change things. I think that'll lead to more thriving in the lives of straight Christians. If we actually teach the Scriptures and help them live it out, and I think if we eliminate that double standard, it'll make it easier for LGBT plus Christians to follow God's wisdom. And last but not least, if we're going to invite some gay people and some straight people in our churches to walk out lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom, we've got to be places where those people can find some kind of human family in the body of Christ. Some kind of lived in lifelong family. Maybe that's encouraging people to stay connected and living with or living closely to biological family. Maybe that's living next door moving in with kind of an unrelated family at your church. Maybe that's building some kind of intentional Christian community. I'm a part of kind of a modern monastery of sorts, but whatever that looks like, you know, what we see in the early church in Acts 6 is the church accepts the responsibility to provide a home and a family for widows. What if the church today accepted the responsibility to foster and cultivate places where single people could find a family and find a home? I think that would change things in a big way. Not only for LGBT plus Christians who are trying to follow God's wisdom, but our churches are full of single young adult women who feel lonely. It's full of widows and divorces who feel lonely. And we can offer all of those different people. Thicker family in the body of Christ. One, they'll find the fine love, they'll find human family. But two, people who right now may be feel dragged down and feel like their kingdom or capacity is running low. All of a sudden we'll have so much more to offer the church and offer their community because they're filled with the love of Jesus. Through his church. So I think it's a win, win, win all the way. No, that's great, man. I like how you talked about raising this standard to a true biblical standard rather than lowering it. Because so much of this conversation comes down to someone can't have a fulfilled life without sleeping with who they want to sleep with. And if we take that to a logical conclusion, that's a terrible statement. And it's just not true. It's not at all true. I mean, what do you say to people who've never even had a chance to have those interactions? That life is certainly can flourish and be worth living. And so people really don't think that out. Oh, you're denying somebody to sleep with who they want to sleep with. And therefore life is not worth living. Christians, I mean, Christians have to think through that a little better. So thank you for that. I thought that you make some great points. And very practical for our listeners who are really looking to do better and need some need to advice there. Last question though, and I've even experienced this in my personal life. And I just want to get your view of it. Kids. And you just talked about age appropriate. My one of my things was at a school where I think they were showing LGBTQ plus things to the kids that were not age appropriate. And that were better left to parents. And it became such a pattern that we had to remove them from the school. We also hear about books and libraries. Not being age appropriate. You have all kind of sex acts in the books. And what do you make of that? Do you see in pop culture and undo influence to push some kids towards one way or another? Just towards confusion, right? How do you deal with that? Because I don't want to be the culture. Culture warrior on it and see things where they aren't. But I also have my own experience where I've actually seen it. And I know that it's real too. So go ahead. Yeah, I mean, it's real. And I think in some ways also, it's not anything new. Like, there have always been a deliberate effort by humans to impact the next generation based on what they think would be best for the next generation. And so, actually, sexual and gender identity just happened to be at the forefront of that today. And yeah, we could spend a lot of time and energy debating where that is and is not happening. And what efforts are more agregist than others? And maybe fantasize about a world where we remove all of those influences from media and schools and libraries and parks. But what I hear from parents that they care most about is how to best care for their kids. That's what I'm hearing from you. And so I think it's best to focus on the real challenge, like unless a parent moves their family out into the middle of nowhere. And homeschools their kids and doesn't let them get on the internet until they're 18. There is no way to really keep your kids from being exposed to some of these things. And then biology, like nature is working against parents, like studies are showing that on average. The kids are going through puberty years earlier than a century ago. Yet they are developing their mental and emotional capacities to make sense of life later than they did centuries ago. Like they're going the opposite directions, right? So we're like, it seems unavoidable that your kids are going to be confronted by broken sexuality in our world. In one way or another, earlier than you wish they would be. And earlier than they had the capacity to make sense of un-nourmed. So you've got two options. Parents can wish we lived in a world where they didn't have to talk to their kids about these things until later in life. And let the enemy and culture and TikTok get to their kids earlier and shape how their kids think about the world and all kinds of ways, including sexuality and gender. And then you can try to have conversations with them years later and try to play ketchup with your kids. And try to undo what's already been set in. Or parents can seek out the equipping they need to proactively disciple their kids around sexuality and gender. And initiate recurring age-appropriate conversations with kids from an early age of about God's love and wisdom for everyone's sexuality and gender. You can get your kids before the enemy or culture or TikTok does. And teach them how to understand the world through the eyes of Jesus. And I think there's a value in kind of doing both to reason to be reasonably limit exposure. I mean, I'm not going to sit there. Oh, it's out there. So let me watch this pornographic movie with my kids because it one day they're going to see it anyway, right? But there's a limiting of the exposure in a reasonable way, but at the same time walking them through and having those conversations. So to me, it's not one of the other, but there's no way in the world. I mean, if they turn on the television and watch the commercial, they're going to see something. But at the same time, I mean, when I limit that while letting them know, like, no, we love everybody in regards of who you are and how you feel he loved God loves you. I think a lot of parents are trying to walk through in that way. Yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. And I can imagine a lot of parents when they hear that and they hear about this responsibility to like prepare their kids for all of this, they're freaked out. I don't know about you. You know, I mean, you're a smart guy. You've done a lot of studying. You may feel like you have what you need to like initiate these conversations with your kids, but most of the parents I'm connected to they. They feel very unprepared. And so last thing I'll just say is there's a lot of good resources out there to equip parents around these conversations, but I would personally recommend you check out a quips parent course. That's the the ministry that I help run and you can check that out at equip your community dot org for slash parent course. My coworker, Amber Carroll, she's a former public school English teacher and a parent of two kids and from her experience in the classroom and as a mom, she's developed kind of a comprehensive resource to upscale parents around this stuff to to initiate these conversations with their kids about sexual stewardship for all people, but also about LGBT plus topics and and she's even written like 50 different conversation scripts. Shunch for different ages for how to have these conversations with your kids, how to initiate conversations, how to respond to tricky questions that come up. So yeah, check that out. Do your homework and disable your kids around sexuality and gender before somebody else does Peter. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for this conversation. Do not let any of these folks deter you from what you're doing discourage you from what you're doing. The campaign is behind you. We appreciate what you are doing and it is certainly God's work. And what I want to tell the people listening today is you guys know that the campaign is all about compassion and conviction. And in no other area is that more important than what we're talking about today. For Christians who come from a more conservative point of view, we have to reckon with the failures of the church on this issue. And we have to start having these conversations and engaging with a broken heart. Because if we can't do that, then we're not going to understand what's necessary to move forward in a healthy way. And for those and I know there's a lot of pastors in Atlanta and everywhere else with big names that are moving towards affirming. For those who are getting closer to affirming or are affirming, I would say to you, you need to have some more imagination and conviction. Because sometimes you have to follow God even when you can't see why that's the right thing to do. Sometimes just go because limited and you just can't see why that makes sense. If you really believe in the word, you need to stand on those convictions and understand that God's compassion is greater than your compassion is understanding of love is greater than yours. And sometimes we do things that seem right to us, but are actually destroying us or destroying those around us. So compassion and conviction always. Thank you again for joining us. I know what it is, and I can't. There's a cross that neither political conservatives and no progressivism is fit to bear. There's a civic hearing and neither faithful witnesses who love social justice and won't surrender the truth to be loved by the world. Politics with the boldness and compassion of Jesus Christ until next time, and can't. Well, I'll let you. Delo. Thank you for my simple order. I'm like a city. Hey man.
