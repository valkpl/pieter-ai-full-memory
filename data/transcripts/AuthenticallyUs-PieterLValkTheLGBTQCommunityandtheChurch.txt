Our guest today is so knowledgeable. We're diving into what it means to be Christian and gay. So lean in for this one because our guest Peter has so much to say on this topic. And it definitely is going to blow your mind because it definitely will mind. Yeah, for sure. So let's let's dive straight in and let's get to it. Let's go on everybody. Welcome to another episode of Authentic Leus. We appreciate you stopping by. Today we have a special guest. Peter Volk is with us. Peter, how you doing man? I'm doing great. Glad to be here. That's awesome. So tell all listeners a little bit about you. Yeah, I'm a writer and speaker about discernment and singleness for the Lord and LGBT plus topics according to a traditional sexual ethic. I've been published in some places like Christianity today. I'm also the founder and executive director of the QWIP, which is a premier consulting and training solution for churches that want to be places where gay people can thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic. We work with a bunch of churches and a bunch of Christian leaders. I'm also a teacher and an aspiring deacon in the Anglican church in North America. I've helped start an acumenically Christian monastery that offers men to family to men called to Kingdoms. Single is called the National Family of Brothers in National Tennessee. And then I'm a licensed professional counselor, specialized in serving gay Christians hoping to steer their sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic. And I mean, each of these jobs has to do with sexuality and finding belonging in the body of Christ and all this work matters to me because I'm a Christian and I'm gay and I'm committed to a traditional sexual ethic. And at least how I define that is a belief that God's best for every Christian is either a lifetime vocation of abstinence, single is for the sake of doing Kingdom work with undivided attention or a lifetime vocation of opposite sex marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom. So yeah, that's a little a little about me quite the introduction. Right. Right. You do a lot. I can listen to that over and over. Yeah, they're about to mention that you are a rising social media figure. You're really just missing the blue check, which I think is coming. Yeah, this guy needs a great place. It's a great place for reach people and to share about some of these ideas that people not heard about. They've not heard about what the Bible really has to say about singleness for the Lord. They don't know that there's there's a way to be gay and Christian in follow the script for teachings. So which I'm sure we'll get to chat about some today. So I'm already excited for this. Well, this is already going to be a good one. Yes, we know social media. I remember coming across one of your reels in the way you talked about the church loving the gay community. I was like, oh yeah, we mean this guy on the podcast because. Come on, I want one, a two words to this topic with someone that understood it more than us and you with that guy. Well, we're thanks for grateful. Yeah, yes, we're very grateful. So yeah, let's dive in. What did your upbringing look like? Yeah, so I grew up in kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of rural town in East Tennessee in a Christian home who have going to church hearing the Bible taught and the things of the Bible taught about and in sixth grade, I realized I was I was gay that I was attracted to other guys and I basically like, slower than I would never let anyone else know who I really was. I mean, I was ashamed. I was afraid that other people would find out and treat me poorly because of that. And I felt really alone. I mean, the the family and church I grew up in didn't really talk about gay people that much. I mean, when it did come up, it was in the context of politics or a simple statement that God was against homosexuality, but it was clear that like gay was bad and good Christians aren't supposed to be gay. So after our realized that I was gay, I tried to change that part of myself. Like between the ages of 13 and 23, so over that decade, I prayed hundreds if not thousands of prayers that God would make me straight. I went to a hundred plus hours of counseling with a therapist who promised they could, you know, reduce my gainess. And I spent about nine months working, interning for a parade the gay away of the ministry, but despite all those efforts, you know, I'm still pretty thoroughly attracted to to to to men that I find attractive. So that's not changed. You know, I was also really afraid that people would would find out. Like I was still afraid that I actually dropped out of theater just so people wouldn't suspect I was gay. So in middle school, like I played the leading roles in both of our theater productions. And then it has quickly realized that the same people in theater club, were also in the gay straight alliance. And I could not risk anything I was gay, so no more theater for Peter. But yeah, I think one of the most, I don't know, painful moments growing up was probably when my own fear of like being outed and kind of discussed with my own sexuality turned to homophobia that hurt others. There was this one moment I was like on the cross country team. And there was this guy named Derek who was the only openly gay guy in our school at the time. And he was also on the cross country team. And as we waited at the starting line for a race to begin again, everyone started pairing up and doing partner stretching like we always do. But this was the first race, you know, after he had come out of school. And as Derek asked the other guys to help him stretch, he was turned away. Like one after another, a guy's different guy said, no, gross. Like I don't want to touch you. I don't want you touching me. And then he got to me. And I like sheepishly refused as well. I know, dishing out the same pain, the same rejection that I was going to overweight. So, and and all this was really lonely. I mean, I, I didn't think there was anything I'd like me, you know, I grew up being taught by TV and culture around me, some pretty horrible stereotypes of gay people. I mean, I was led to believe that that the gay people all went to group sex parties and they all had AIDS and they all had to do drugs and none of them wanted anything to do with Jesus. So, based on that image, I didn't think I belonged with gay people, at least according to that stereotype. And then on the other side, all the Christians I knew were straight or so I thought. And so I was led to beliefs in order to be a good Christian. I had to be straight. And then there was me stuck in the middle and no man's land. You thought I don't belong in either of these places. But I mean, it was in this loneliness that it is IR to be known to be fully known and fully loved grew. And, you know, when I started sharing my story, it was a mixed bag in the beginning. But thankfully, a lot of people have responded to my story with love and compassion. I remember, particularly during my sophomore year of college, after a gay brother, left our fraternity because he was in kind of an open relationship, romantic sexual relationship with another dude and that was kind of against our communities, our fraternity is called a conduct. I took the scariest step of sharing my story with the entire fraternity because I needed straight guys in our fraternity to know how to better love people like me. They saw some of the ways they were responding to this guy leading our fraternity. And I needed other brothers who were gay to know they weren't alone. And after I shared my fear of like being shunned, turned into joyful surprise as brother after brother lined up and gave me a hug and opened their phone to schedule a meal and get to know me better. And to this day, like those guys have a body-criced for me better than the most churches have. So yeah, after sharing with that fraternity, a number of those guys who were gay and had similar beliefs as me shared with me about their story. And we started kind of making sense of life together and doing life together. And I think I realized at some point in college that all of us were afraid, well, two things were true for all of us. One, we were afraid that if we follow the Bible's wisdom, we would be alone. In none of us had parents or pastors who knew what to do with us, who knew how to help us. And really, that's the origins of like all the stuff I do today. By the end of college, I had gotten into medical school, but I couldn't shake the feeling that God instead wanted me to go into full-time ministry, helping churches love gay people like me. And that was like nine years ago. And I started a quip, the ministry that I that I helped run on. Like my full-time job, to help a quip parents and pastors to better love and serve gay people according to a traditional sexual ethic. And then back in 2017, I started the Nashville family brothers to help combat that fear that I would be alone if I lived out celibacy for a lifetime. Started the Nashville family brothers to offer celibate man regardless of sexual orientation, lifelong lived in family because it's also what I needed. Yeah. So yeah, in many ways, my pain and making sense of that has been the source of also all of the cool, Kingdom work projects, I get to be a part of and do with God today, which is, which I'm grateful for. And it's amazing how that works. You know, like, we look back on our lives. We see different trauma, different experiences, how we were raised, that like in the moment, this is the worst thing I've ever experienced. And then we look back and you're like, wow, I can actually speak into the lives of people who are going through exactly what I'm going through, so they don't have to deal with what I did. You know, and it's awesome to see where you're at. But I didn't want to, I didn't want to peel back a little bit. You mentioned when you were six, that's when you knew you were gay. Six, what? Sorry, I'm not a great. Sorry, six, great. What was the moment? Like, what was the, what was the deciding factor or did something happen that you came to that realization? Yeah, I mean, if I'm honest, I think, you know, unfortunately, it's very common for teenagers in kind of the millennial generation going into the present to be exposed to pornography and very common to have a really unhealthy relationship with pornography. That's a whole other conversation about the level of kind of sexual addiction with pornography and other things just rampant in our churches among adult men and among teenage men and there's plenty of that among women as well. So it's not just something that men struggle with, but so you know, unfortunately, I was a friend in middle school, you know, told me what pornography was, told me what websites to go to. And, you know, it just it, I think it was honestly watching those videos that over a couple of months, I didn't want to really admit to myself that I was watching the men, I was watching straight pornography, but I didn't want to admit to myself that I was paying attention to the men in straight pornography much more than I was paying attention to the women. And then eventually I just like came, came really undeniable and then the stuff I started searching for changed. But so I don't think you know, both as my personal experience and knowing other people's stories and as a as a licensed professional counselor with expertise in psychology, you know, I don't think watching pornography made me gay, but it may have accelerated the age at which it was clear and obvious and undeniable to me that's what I was drawn to. But my hunch is if it hadn't been become clear to me in sixth grade, by eighth, ninth, tenth grade, you know, it would have become undeniable, clear to me. Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned some things also about this, this is everything with the church. And I can only imagine like hearing you were at now and then also hearing what you went through about, some of the organizations pray they gay away or you know, praying these things and maybe Christians even shunning you at a time. And I remember growing up, you know, Tony and I for from a small town, we say we're from the sticks as well. Nobody, I mean the church for sure didn't talk about how to handle homosexuals or gay people at all, not definitely not in a good way. So I can only imagine like some of the things you went through. Can you talk a little bit about like, like where you are now and then those ex-negative experiences, like I can only imagine like church, her coming from that. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of the pain that I experienced was the pain of the closet was the pain of I heard enough from Christians and saw enough when that guy Derek in our school for example came out to know that if I shared about this part of my story, I was going to get hurt and so it was safer to hide. But what that meant was I was making sense of this stuff for a long time, all by myself. But not really all by myself because I was it was me alone with really the enemy. Yeah. And the enemy's lies and the enemy's accusations and and things like pornography that the enemy offered me to try to sue and numb and escape from my painful reality. And there was a lot of shame. There's a lot that the enemy told me over and over again that that it was my fault that I was gay or it was my fault that I was still gay because I wasn't good enough that I deserved to be broken in this way that this is some punishment from God or that if I didn't do enough to become straight, I would never be loved that no one would ever love me. That was unloved bull because I was broken in this particular way no matter how well I resisted temptation. That led to lots of anxiety. It led to depression. Thankfully for me, it did not lead to suicidality. Thankfully for me, it did not lead to doubting the goodness of God or doubting the truth of a traditional sexual ethic or doubting God's existence. But I know lots of people who those things were true for them that it led to suicide. It led to a doubt of whether God was good or existed at all or whether his wisdom was reliable. And then when I did start sharing my story, it was a mixed bag. I mean, I shared some good stories. But there were some painful stories of people responding really poorly to me sharing about this part of my story. But I think the most painful part of it and this is true for, I'm a licensed professional counsel and I primarily meet with gay Christians trying to do their sexualities according to a traditional sexual ethic. The primary hurt the experiences the closet and the experience the closet that is still the result of the church hurt because instead of our churches teaching every kid in our church about God's love and wisdom for everybody. God's wisdom for sexual stewardship for everybody and an age appropriate ways. God's love and wisdom for gay people and encouraging our kids before purity. Hey, if this is a part of your story or any other things or a part of your story, you don't have to make sense of this alone talk to us, you know, and our churches ought to have been up to been demonstrating safety in offering God's love and wisdom. Instead of doing that, you know, our church is waiting until a kid comes out to talk about these topics and often in lacking compassion. So we just kind of leave kids to be easy targets for the enemy to manipulate for years and years and years in the closet because of the silence of our churches on these streets. So I think that's the most profound church hurt. It's not the overt home of Obia after kids come out of the closet. It's the out of inaction and gross negligence. Wow, letting eight, nine, ten-year-old boys and girls, letting the enemy have a free for all with them for on average five years. Yeah. Wow, that's, I'm sorry, like this is so like heartbreaking to know that, you know, a place that should be a place for people to come and be known and accepted that that's not the extent of the gay community. But your story brings me back to a post as I saw probably the last week and it's about churches that sit on the fence are ultimately hurting gay Christians. Can you talk more about why is it important for churches to engage this and how can they love the gay community better? Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, first I'll tie it directly just to what we were just talking about, which was if a church and what I mean, I'm a church, I particularly mean the leaders of that church. Either they aren't sure what they believe on this topic or know what they believe on this topic, but think that if they were clear about what they believe on this topic, it would cost them membership and donations and budget or just cost them popularity and influence in their community or online. If they're not sure what their church thinks about these topics, most churches then are silent on these topics. They want to avoid the conversation as much as possible. And that's what enables the enemy to have this five year free for all with every gay girl and boy. So that's a big cost of sitting the fence. I think another issue of another cost of churches sitting the fence and not making clear what they believe on these topics is it keeps them then from being able to teach stray people on their churches how to be better friends to gay people in ways that embody God's love and God's wisdom. And then also the church can't invest in some of the solutions and the direct care for LGBT plus people in their community because again, they've got to avoid the conversation. You can't make announcements during the announcement's time at church about resources you have available for LGBT plus people in your church that are going to help them embrace and thrive according to God's love and wisdom. If you've never talked about these topics and if you're bringing up the idea of resources for this population, open some of the can of worms that forces your congregation to have a conversation that you don't want to have. So silence that's the only way to avoid that is to keep the silence. But the silence is a tool that the enemy knows how to use really well. Yeah, you know even Tony and I was talking about in 2020 when we read all time high for racial injustice and him and I talked so much about the silence spoke louder than people who are actually being racist actually saying these things. And I can only imagine years upon years upon years and the church about the LGBT Q plus community. I know from experience for me, I currently were going to church now and I live in San Diego and when I first moved to San Diego, I would say I had a very small minded and I started working in this area. It's called Hill Crest which is predominantly gay. There's like a lot of gay bars and stuff like that and the gym I was working at a lot of people from the LGBT Q plus community would come in. And at first it was very, it was very new for me and I didn't really know how to interact like one of my like, you know co-workers and what's so ever. And then it has got to the point where I got to actually know people, these people and it's like these are people who just want to be those who want to be known who want to be sub and no matter if I agree with their lifestyle or not, these are people that I now care about, that I now care about their feelings, their their thoughts and things like that. So can you can you talk a little bit about how important it is to get to know the person instead of seeing maybe their lifestyle or maybe even some of the things they may start with. How important is to put a face to it? Yeah, for sure. Because I think you're right, I think particularly in our kind of politically charged and culturally charged environment inside and outside of our churches is it's easy for the average kind of straight congregant that when they imagine a gay person, they imagine, you know, the the loudest, most militant person in their social media feed who is LGBT and always talking about this stuff and you're very antagonistic way or the most extreme kind of, you know, public figure who is advocating on behalf of LGBT plus people. And those people exist, but that's not most people, that's not most people, most LGBT plus people just like anybody else, they're just trying to do their part, get paid to have a good time with friends and like it will rest in you. Like, yeah, yeah, there's just normal people and they're too busy with like the the the the broken reality of life to to get on the internet and argue with people about that kind of stuff. So, I do think it's really important to get to know just in the same way that, you know, any of us can think about kind of our cultural or political affiliations or or sensibilities or and kind of imagine who is the person in your club, in your group, the you least want to represent you and then assume and then imagine if everyone when they heard that person saying something in public or saying something on the internet, they assume that they spoke for you. No one wants that, right? Yeah. So, yeah, it gets to know the individual, what I've I'm going to sound like a broken record here, but when I'm kind of talking to pastors or just kind of your average straight, Christian, I say, you know, when you when you think about LGBT plus ministry in your church, you probably think about this kind of 20s or 20 or 30 year old gay non Christian who does not who who does not believe in a traditional sexual ethic and and a focus of LGBT plus ministry is how do we convert them to Christianity and and convince them of the traditional sexual ethic and what I instead challenge people to think about when they think about LGBT plus ministry is three worlds in their views. Some of whom five or six years later are going to realize they experience the same sex attraction. Yeah. And over those five years, between ages three and eight, did they hear from their parents and from their children's pastor? God's love and wisdom and careful age appropriate ways in ways that encourage that kid to share early with their parents. If same sex attraction is a part of their story or did what they heard or didn't hear from their parents and children's pastors encouraged them to hide that and makes sense of that alone in the closet with the lives of the enemy and the culture. That's the first thing we should think about when we think about LGBT plus ministry is that image. Now, I'm not saying that sharing the gospel with non Christians who happen to also be LGBT plus isn't important. That's also very important outreach. But when we think about LGBT plus ministry, I want to first encourage us to think about the three year old in the view who five years later is going to realize the experience, same sex attraction. What have they been hearing? Are we setting them up to embrace God's love and wisdom for them or are we setting them up to embrace something else? Are they safe? Yeah. It's a safe place for them to share that or share like they took an extra brownie from from lunch. Like, are we setting out? That's so good. It is about the safety and the trust and that's what the church should be. We talk a lot about how it should be a hospital for the sick and not, you know, a, I don't know the opposite thing. I forget what the saying is. But like, you're right. Think about, you know, Tony and I were we were actually to the podcast on Bel Air. I don't know if you've seen it, but they actually cover everything, everything in this show. And they actually started with Ashley from the fresh prints, but now in Bel Air, who is, you know, exploring her sexuality and, you know, she told her sister that she thinks she's attracted to a woman. And this is the first show that I've experienced that it started so young. Usually we see him in their 20s or 30s. So I think you're right with saying that like, hey, let's think about even younger. Is this a safe place for them to talk about it? And that's what we want to create. Yeah. You know, absolutely. So what would you say to the Christian that wants to love the gay community, but feels like it is challenging because they don't want to love them in a way that condones their lifestyle? Yeah. So there can be a variety of kind of motivations behind that fear. Sometimes when I interact with people who have this like, if I don't condemn, I'm condoning. Sometimes their fear is that they feel this sense of that the LGBT riots movement has been advancing very quickly and very effectively. They feel threatened by that. And that creates insecurity and fear. And we don't like to feel afraid. And so in a lot of us, that thing creates anger that covers over that. And we feel anger toward the LGBT class of community because we're scared by them and scared by their advance. And so even if it's not intentional like our gut reaction to that community is anger, it's frustration. And you know, that kind of sequence of emotions is like, you know, that's how a lot of our hearts happen, you know? So I'm not trying to shame people for feeling that, but what I would kind of encourage for for that person responding with with anger and feeling this like need to condemn is asked them, you know, is I want to believe in the best of that person who feels who feels like if they don't condemn their condoning. And I think what they ultimately want is not to judge people what they want is it's for the gospel and God's wisdom to be affected and be embraced. And so my question for them would be, do you think condemning will be the most effective? Why do you think that gay people that some gay people are not Christians or some gay Christians are not convinced of a traditional sexual identity? Do you think it's because they haven't been judged enough? Do you think it's because they haven't heard what the Bible says about this? Do you think that they just don't know that this is wrong in God's eyes? No, right? Like every gay person they've been told that it's wrong enough. They know what the passages in the scripture are better than most straight people do. And and they know what at least historically Christians, how Christians have understood God to think about these topics. The reasons why a lot of gay people end up leaving the church and certainly abandon a traditional sexual ethic is because that those painful experiences in the closet. Is because when they eventually come out, they don't see churches where gay people are following God's wisdom and thriving according to a traditional sexual identity. Instead what they were met with for decades was a destructive and false pre-the-gay away theology that doubled rates of suicidality and led to the loss of life and faith of hundreds of thousands of LGBT plus people. And they also came out in a church that had a double standard about sexual stewardship. There was holding this high standard of sexual stewardship for gay people, but then was kind of ignoring what the Bible had to say about straight people considering lifetime celibacy. Ignoring what the Bible had to say about about, you know, of standing from sex outside of marriage. If you're ignoring what the Bible had to say about adultery and about divorce and about remarriage, ignoring what the Bible had to say about kind of what the God's purposes for Christian marriage are because it was convenient for the majority to bend the rules. But then continuing to hold gay people to a high standard of sexual stewardship. And in an era, they said, that's not because people love God and his word. That's because people hate gay people. So if, if what that kind of straight Christian who feels like they, if they don't condemn their condoning, if what they're really motivated by is that they, they, they, they, they, they know that gay people are, are mating God's image and that God loves them and God wants them to to experience God's love and follow God's wisdom and a way that leads to thriving in their life, then maybe we should start with recognizing some of the ways that we've made it hard for gay people to believe that God's wisdom is good and take some of the steps in our churches to make God's wisdom good and a very practical, lived in a bodied way. I think that's the best way to to respond to maybe and also even to respond to some of the fear we experience towards this political movement. You know, if that's truly what you're afraid of, then offers people something better in the church, truly better. And, you know, I don't, I don't think our primary goal should be to slow down the LGBT plus rights movement. But I, I, I, I, I, I, I sure bet you things would change. If our churches were actually people, places where gay people could thrive according to God's wisdom with reasonable effort. Yeah. So, so our podcast is called authentically us. And you, you, you've spoken a lot about about your story and, you know, about the church. I wanted to ask, um, being in ministry, leading a ministry, how are you choosing to, to still follow the Bible, but also, you know, be openly gay. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that, yeah, being gay and Christian and committed to a traditional sexual ethic puts me in a weird place. I mean, almost every day, I get attacked by those two like hold a more progressive sexual ethic that think I am self-hating and repressed because I follow God's teachings. And then almost every day I'll also get attacked by cultural conservatives and fundamentalists that, you know, because I continue to experience some same sex attraction or talk about a publicly they think that I must not really love God or really be following his teachings. Um, and, and they don't seem to be able to see that to be authentically me is is is is it's not something that fits in their in their boxes. Um, they just kind of see me in whatever way that's most convenient for their worldview for their agenda. So they can dismiss my story so they don't have to be challenged by my story. So wow. Uh, what does that mean for me to be authentically me? I guess is that like, I am really truly gay. Um, I've got the battle scars of the closet to to prove it. Um, you know, I started making sense of my sexuality at the same time that the Glee first included a gaiting couple and and I had a huge crush on Darren Chris and I really enjoy listening to a choice of on and Lil Nas X because there's something special about knowing their gay too and they wrote these songs about our stories and I get a kick out of painting my fingernails sometimes and alarming my parents at eight year olds of the grocery store, you know, and most of my friends are gay and I stopped praying that God would make me straight and I'm not disgusted by myself anymore and I'm not hiding anymore. I'm not alone anymore. I am a self-loving eyes wide open genuine, bona fide gay person and I am like authentically really truly crisis. No, Jesus is the Lord of my life. I submit everything about my life to his wisdom. Uh, I am a child of God first and foremost. Jesus and Jesus alone sits on the throne of my life. Every decision I make is submitted to his Lordship and Christ demands and deserves my whole life, including how I steward my sexuality and because I am convinced his love and wisdom are the source of trueest, joy and pleasure and meaning, uh, I'm convinced of those things. Um, and I experienced that recognizing my same sex attractions, submitting that brokenness to God and collaborating with him to steward my sexuality in redemptive ways has been the greatest source of blessing in my life and God's glory through my life. So it's been particularly in contrast to that brokenness of my sexuality and that the reality and goodness of God has been apparent to me. Yeah. And I'm gay. So yeah, that sort of looks like for me to be authentically gay and Christian. Um, yeah. Wow. Brother, that that's beautiful. That is really so. Yeah. That's beautiful, man. Um, I was gonna say, especially like how you, you know, about how you're saying like you don't fit in anybody's box because your story is exactly your story, you know, and how you choose to live your life is, is how you choose to live it. Um, and it's cool because you have Jesus guiding that path, um, which, you know, I pray that your story and what you're doing touches so many more people who are like you because I know so many people who are part of the LGBTQ plus community that just don't feel wanted or don't feel they belong in the church and that's not true at all, you know, and I pray that your story truly resonates because that you belong like we need people like you, like you to talk and speak about your experiences because that is where true freedom, true reconciliation will come. Yeah. Facts. I hope so. So another question I have is, is the term gay Christian problem at it? And I asked this because I had someone reach out to me after I posted your posts about churches who said the fence in someone say that they felt like that was problematic because we don't go around calling Christians lying Christian or adult Christians. So why do we still highlight this sin in a touch of Christian? And so yeah, do that makes sense in can you speak to that? Yeah, for sure. So yeah, and there's lots of kind of reasonable objections to that kind of phrase gay Christian and and I've actually kind of because it's a question I get off and enough, I've written kind of a kind of a link a series about why do I use the language that I use and what do I mean when I use the language that I use? So I'd love to kind of post that in y'all's show notes or include that somewhere in the kind of information for this episode and yes, and would love to pass it on to that particular person. But so I'll give a really brief kind of answer, which is like language is complicated. And I don't think there's any phrases or words to kind of describe someone like me that is 100% clear to every listener and 100% free of baggage for every listener. And so what I what I've got to do is I've got to think about who is who am I called to minister to and what's the language that would be most effective with that audience and then I use that language knowing that like it's not going to fit for everybody. So it's just a kind of quite quickly teasing it out, you know, just some different meanings of the word gay versus same sex attracted. So with the word gay, you know, I know when I was growing up when people use the word gay, they attacked into that. They assumed with that word that horrible stereotype I shared earlier that they're all going to group sex partners. They all have aes, or all do in drugs and none of one anything to do with Jesus, right? I grew up, that's what gay meant. These days you talk to middle schoolers, high schoolers, you ask them what does it mean to be gay? They say, oh, it's just a boy who likes boys or girl who likes girls and they assume nothing more about that person other than it's just referring to their attractions. The phrase seems like a traction, you know, some people today maybe particularly who are more culturally conservative. They prefer that term because they say, hey, it's it's it's it's simple. It's clear it's what it's talking about, you know, it's just referring to people same sex attractions. And and and and shouldn't that be self-evident? Let's use that language because it's more specific. But what some people don't know is that phrase same sex attraction was popularized by the prairie, the gay way of movement in the 80s and 90s and 2000s. And for a lot of people like me who spent a decade in the prairie, the gay way of movement. A prairie, the gay way of movement that was was was thoroughly unsuccessful. Like scientific research shows that 96 to 97% of people who went through sexual orientation change efforts experience, no change in their sexual orientation. But their participation in those sexual orientation change efforts doubled their risk of suicide. And so when a lot of people from a lot of generations here, the phrase same sex attraction, they associated with deadly prairie, the gay way of the ideology and practices. And talk about a barrier to evangelism, a barrier to the gospel. When you use that phrase with those audiences, they're not going to listen to another word you have to say. So then we find ourselves in a tricky place where if I use either the word gay or the phrase same sex attraction, some people don't like it and some people aren't going to like it. Yeah. So that's where I really have to discern and ask God, well, who have you called me to minister to? What words are most effective with them? And I know God has called me primarily to speak to teenagers and young adults who are gay. And the most effective language to use with them is the word gay and using it the way they use it, which is just to refer to boys who like boys and girls who like girls. Just use it basically to describe people who are same sex attraction. Yeah. But you know, I'm almost pretty clear in a lot of the stuff that I write that I'm a than if I call myself a gay Christian, I say gay Christian committed to a traditional sexual effort. And I'm usually pretty disciplined about including that phrase at the end. Because I do want to make clear, you know, because it's not always clear when people use that phrase. I do want to make clear that like I believe in God's love and wisdom for gay people and I'm following that. Yeah. That's well. You know, that's helpful. Yeah, it definitely you educated me because I didn't I had no clue that it's almost like a word association. Right. You hear this word immediately. It goes this direction, but you're right. It is the people in the audience you're talking about. So knowing your audience, I did want to mention you also talked about how you teach and you've created a program for Christians to be to be celibate. First of all, let's let's define the word celibate for the common ear that doesn't know what that means. And then what does that even look like? Sure, realistically in in 2022. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, when I to use the phrase vocational singleness to refer to what I feel called to some people use the word celibacy. But you know, when I use this phrase vocational singleness or whenever other people use the word celibacy, you know, I'm particularly referring to the kind of singleness that Jesus and Paul are talking about in Matthew 19 and verse Corinthians 7. And Christians have most consistently throughout history understood Jesus and Paul in those passages to be encouraging a particular kind of singleness. That is that actually is a lifetime calling to abstinence singleness for the sake of the kingdom. It's all briefly breakdown at definition. So it's a calling. It's not just based on our preference, but it's actually based on God kind of knowing for each of us whether it would be better for us to live out a life of singleness for Jesus, of abstinence celibate singleness for Jesus, or get married and live out a life of Christian marriage. And God wants to communicate to us which which gift he wants to give us, what which preference he has for us. It's it's permanent that the the historic consistent understanding of the church is that this particular kind of singleness is not like a all-be single until I get married. If you're doing this kind of Jesus singleness that's talked about in Matthew 19 and verse Corinthians 7, it's talking about a lifetime commitment to giving up the possibility of marriage and sex of romance and kids. Okay, but why? It's not just about self-denial. It's it's really about not having the important king to work of of having a spouse and kids to instead use all the energy you would have used on a spouse and kids to do other kingdom work with undivided attention. Because there's ways that like when parents are busy raising kids, there's just stuff that they don't have the time and energy to attend to in our communities. And so you know I think Jesus' intentions, intention here is to have like a minority of Christians be like a SWAT team for kingdom work that they're like they've got expertise and availability and capacity to yeah and time and all those things to address you know I mean obviously to share the gospel and do some of the more obvious work of the church but I think also to address some of the like brokenness in our society and heal some of the division in our communities that will ultimately like in body gods love and and show people the Jesus' real and bring wholeness to to our world which is which is the big project of of of of Christ's death and resurrection is not just about saving us from our sins but it's about making right the wholeness and so people called to vocational singles can particularly be able to do that. Okay so that's like a lot of like theological jargon. That's good though. Well send it off for a newsletter. Okay. Which is remote cash up. But yeah more practically what does that look like for us in this Nashville family of brothers that's the community that we've started. You know one thing I didn't mention is this vocational single is the single is for Jesus. Is not a call to be like alone for the sake of the kingdom. It's not a call to go in your prayer closet every night and spend every day and night alone. That's good. When you look in the passage of the scripture that the talk about vocational singleness there's over and over again reference to it's still a call to enjoying healthy intimacy, friendship, companionship, in non-romantic and non-sexual ways in the context of like committed long-term permanent Christian community like real family and that's how the that that that that's celibate people in the early church did it. And so we're just really what we're doing in our community is just trying to imitate to learn from how celibate people have done family over the past 2000 years and that's by we live in a house together and we pray together in the mornings and we do meals together and holidays together and vacations together and then we each are still a part of different local churches and we're still a part of kind of married people and kids you know outside of our house we're still part of their lives and and then you know we we feel like we're supposed to be using our singleness for the sake of the kingdom and for us we feel particularly called that we're supposed to be kind of each individually praying and asking God God how do you want me to use my nine to five job how do you want me to use my primary work hours to advance the kingdom more quickly and need to as are doing that in different ways so that that's what it looks like for us so when you think of the kind of celibacy we're doing don't think of people who are living in like loneliness and self denial think about a think about people who we still have rich robust family I still have really meaningful friendships that involve healthy emotional intimacy and and non-sexual non-reventic physical intimacy and healthy spiritual intimacy and healthy intellectual intimacy yeah sure romance and sex are not a part of the equation for me but I still like I still have a lot of really meaningful relationship and yeah man this has been so so great far beyond I can imagine we're so thankful for that I'll be given a move on to our next segment which our next segment is called rapid fire oh so what we're going to do we're going to ask you three questions just only three three and it's going to be the first thing that comes to mind so don't don't phone a friend sure no this is the first thing that comes to mind three questions you ready okay all right let's get it let's go what brings you joy hmm right now in our community we just we're growing so a couple of new guys are going to be joining moving into our house in the next month and we need a more space and we found this amazing house to rent that has like it's basically like a monastery it has eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms and two kitchens and two living rooms is so much space for us and it's affordable and it's in and a neighborhood it's close whoever living now and last night we all we had all the guys over all the guys who live in the house had dinner together we had the couple guys over who were going to be moving in soon and we all walked over to the house and got a photo of it together and had a great meal last night together and it's those kind of things that yeah brain joy yeah and I wish you guys can see his face as he's describing his it's really he's truly joyful not this yeah what was the last movie you watched oh I went to go see four eleven thunder and theaters and I'll have to say I mean I just I like all of the Marvel movies and I will go see them even if I expect it don't know if they'll be that good because I just want to know what's what's going on in the plot you gotta be in the room yeah so what are you ready to thumbs up thumbs down it was mediocre I think what was disappointing is like it doesn't feel like it really moved the larger storyline and so it you know I'm like okay where we go with this right right you know what's your favorite beverage favorite beverage oh well if we're saying not not the hall it's probably Diet Coke okay mommy but um I also okay to be clear you're saying Diet Coke over normal coke that's just what I drink that's that's okay same here so I've gotten used to at this point that now if I drink regular coke it tastes funky to me it tastes sweet or sweet a different way I don't know but but gosh something between a nice glass of red wine or some whiskey to sip on or a mint jiu-lip no not I'm in jiu-lip sorry a mojito for my favorite beverage if it's alcoholic so nice I'm actually about to go on a cruise with a friend a couple and we're trying to figure out kind of some of our beverage options for the cruise so did they get more of that that's awesome that's yeah well thanks so much for your time where can people find you or what resources would you point people to if they want to start learning and figuring out what it means to love the gay community yeah so you can find me on Instagram Twitter Facebook at at Peter L.
