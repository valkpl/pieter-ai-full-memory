Well it's certainly a privilege to be able to speak with you again today. It was just a little over a week ago now, I think we were both in Kansas City together at the loved to love conference, which is a resourcing conference for the LGBT plus community, those who minister to and with them and family members. We really had a great time. I know that as one who was invited to come and lead worship for the week, it was one of the most beautiful times that I've had in years. So I really appreciated so many of the speakers who had so many good things. I came to listen and to learn and I learned so much. And part of that was because of you and the great presentation that you made through Eclipse. So I'm excited to be able to speak with you today. As we begin in our conversation here, could we start by just having you tell some of your backstory to our listeners? Maybe who you are, how you were raised and just giving a little bit of context for where you find yourself today? Yeah, sure. So I grew up in Northeast Tennessee culturally conservative environment in the 90s in a Christian family, mom and dad and a brother went to church regularly and read the Bible regularly. And then in sixth grade, I realized that I was gay or I realized that I experienced same sex attractions. I saw that I would never let anyone know this part of my story. I mean, I was pretty ashamed and afraid others would find out and treat me poorly because of that and I was really alone. So you know, probably like many in your audience, the family and church I grew up in rarely talked about gay people. But when they did it, mostly came up with the context of politics and or a simple statement that God is against homosexuality. It was clear that like that gay was bad and that good Christians weren't gay. So once I realized that that was a part of my story and not something that I chose and something that I tried to ignore and then I tried to change it. I tried to pray that away. I mean, between the ages of 13 and 23, I prayed hundreds of prayers that God would make me straight. I went to a hundred plus hours of counseling over that decade with different therapists who thought that they could reduce my gainess. And I spent about nine months in a pray the gay away ministry. And yet my same sex attractions didn't change one bit during that time. So I mean growing up, like I was I was so afraid that people would find out this part of my story that I dropped out of theater. Just so people wouldn't suspect that I was gay. So like in middle school, I played the leading roles in both of our theater productions. But in high school, I quickly realized that the same people in theater club was also, we're also in the gay straight alliance. I couldn't risk anyone, you know, suspecting that I was gay. So no more theater for Peter. But you know, thankfully I ended up going to college in Nashville, a Vanderbilt University and I was a part of a campus ministry and a Christian fraternity where I thought it was worth the risk of being fully known and known and fully loved. So yeah, I shared about this part of my story with kind of peers for the first time. And then got to share with my entire Christian fraternity of my story and ended up meeting other guys who have the same experience and the same convictions. You know, despite the fact that God did not change my sexual orientation, despite the fact that I felt kind of this dread about my same sex attractions that I did. I continue to be a Christian. I continue to be convinced. The Bible is how I know who God is and the Bible and the church historically seemed to teach pretty clearly about God's best for all people's sexual stewardship, including gay people's sexual stewardship. So I continue to be convinced of a traditional sexual ethic and you use that phrase earlier. You know, when I use that phrase, I mean a traditional sexual ethic is a belief that God's best for his people is either a lifetime calling of abstinence, singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention or a lifetime calling to marriage between one Christian man and one Christian woman with an openness to the important kingdom work of raising children. So that's what I mean when I say a traditional sexual ethic that that's God's best. Okay. Anyway, yeah, toward the end of college, had friends who had similar experiences and realized, you know, we are all pretty similar in the fact that we were all afraid that if we followed God's wisdom, we would be alone for a lifetime and none of us had parents or pastors who knew how to minister to us. And in many ways, those two realizations were kind of the impetus, the beginnings of two of the big projects I'm a part of today, which is a ministry that seeks to equip parents and pastors to minister better to people like me according to a traditional sexual ethic. And then starting an intentional Christian community where men called the Celebrity regardless of sexual orientation can find family in the body of Christ. So yeah, that's a little bit about me and really quick version of how we got wherever you are today. Yeah, there's so much more to it. I was listening to some of your story on another podcast too, and I want to dig just express how much of a struggle this was for you in some ways too. And one of the stories that I heard, and I don't remember where I heard it, but I do remember you telling the story of even, I think it was being on the track team and there was maybe somebody in your high school that was out and was sort of, I don't know, maybe bullied. I guess a little bit because of this. And I remember in the in the story, you could tell it obviously better than I could. But in the fear that you had that you would be found out as nobody else wanted to be this person's partner in something you were doing on the track that you as well in order to not be found out were sort of like, no, you leave get away from me too, you know, type thing. And so I want to do express that just to say like, there's this pressure that is on people, especially who are same sex attracted, I think in some ways more than we realize that I say we as people who aren't in that category, maybe there's a fear there that enables you sometimes to do things you wouldn't even do just to not be found out, you know. And so I guess I want to do it to say that is not not to point out like, well, shame on you for doing that because I wouldn't say that at all what I'm saying is there's a load that I think the especially our young people are carrying and maybe sometimes the church makes it even more hard, you know, sometimes it maybe sometimes the church creates an even bigger burden on top of a burden that they're already feeling. I'm not even going to say maybe it does and it has, you know, in many ways as you just said, oftentimes parents don't know how to talk about it. And then if you don't mind, I want to focus a little bit on you said you'd spent some time in this pray the gayaway ministry or this ex- gay ministry. And I think it's important for our audience to hear from you on this too that those like ex-adissinternational places that specialize in this for a long time have basically shut down or at least change their method because they've said we don't really have a good success rate in terms of, would you speak to that just a little bit just to help my listeners understand some more of that? Yes, so briefly I'll say first that God has the power to do whatever he wants, right? Some share testimonies of miraculous sexual orientation change. And I believe those people that that is their story. And I think it's important to put that in the category of miracle, something uncommon, unexpected because what we do see from really high quality research from people over the past decades who have sought out sexual orientation change efforts is that 96 to 97% of people who sought out those those interventions experienced no meaningful change and their same sex attractions, 96 to 97%. And the same research found that participation and sexual orientation change efforts doubled individuals risk of suicide out. Wow. So ineffective at sexual orientation change but effective at doubling your risk of suicide. And so I think it's important to look at all of those numbers and recognize can God do miraculous things? Yes, can an individual if they want to pray and ask God for those things? Sure. But giving people false hope that they are likely to experience sexual orientation change and tying whether or not their sexual orientation change efforts are successful to whether or not they're praying hard enough or they're doing it right or they're faithful enough is really dangerous for that person's mental health and spiritual health. So part of my professional training is I'm a licensed professional counselor in the state of Tennessee. I've got my masters in clinical mental health counseling and over and over again I've met with counseling clients who they tied the goodness of God or whether or not God was even real to whether or not God would change their same sex attractions. And then when God didn't because God doesn't do miracles most of the time the bottom fell out of their faith. The bottom fell out of their belief that God was good or the God loved them. And so I just don't think the solution to the quote unquote gay problem in our churches is sexual orientation change ever. I think the solution is to recognize that there will be many Christians in our churches who by no choice of their own experiences brokenness of same sex attraction and it will be enduring it will persist throughout their lifetime. How do we become a church where Christians faithful Christians with persisting same sex attractions can belong in our churches can be faithful that we provide the support and the resources so that they can find family in the body of Christ and so they can have joy and fullness of life despite those enduring same sex attraction. So I think that's what our churches should focus on. I don't think the solution is pray the gay away. I also don't think the solution is to ignore what the Scriptures have to say about God's best for for all people. I think we have to resist both of those extremes and instead say God's wisdom is still good for all people including gay people and sexual orientation change is not the solution. Well thank you for sharing that. I really appreciate that and I appreciate your perspective and for people listening today I want to clarify that this is this is Peter's story too and this is how he has encountered this and I think even the fact that you are someone who wants to serve Jesus with your life makes you different than a lot of people's stories automatically and so much that some people might hear some of the things we're saying they might come from a more progressive view and want to push back on it they might come from an even more conservative view and want to push back on some of these so I want to I want to state right now that I appreciate so much hearing your story that it is this is a personal and real story that you're sharing today and I wanted to ask you as well something has been on my heart because I've done just about all the jobs you can do in ministry over the years. I've been a youth pastor I've been a music pastor I mean I've been the guy that jiggles the handle on the toilet before you leave you know to make sure the doors are locked and all that stuff and one thing that has always been it concerned to me especially when I was a youth pastor was it didn't matter where I was youth pastoring at when it was I always had at some point teens in the youth group and someone that came to me usually trembling full of fear needing to tell this to someone that I'm experiencing same set of traction and I don't know what to do with this some of them have said my last church I told somebody there and they told me never to come back until I changed you know things like that that's a real concern to me because I I want us to to be a place where they can feel like hey this is for you too you know this is not a place for you to be cast out of this is a place for you to come to with open arms and one thing that I would be interested in hearing from you and I think listeners would be too is what are some of the maybe Christian cliches that when someone comes to you in this vulnerable place anyway maybe in a church ministry or maybe just in life Christians are particularly bad sometimes about offering unhelpful and even hurtful cliches sometimes to a person so so let's set up a maybe a scenario where someone is in this situation and they're coming to their pastor or they're coming to someone in their church and they're sharing this very significant part of their life with someone else now what can we do how should we respond as the church to a person in that moment what did you need that maybe you didn't get at that time that can help us in our end of things to say well I wish I wish I would have responded that way or do you understand what I'm asking here I'd love to hear more about that as how we can be a better help I guess yeah so I think the first thing I'd say is I wish I would have shared with us with with someone who was trained to listen and respond well I wish I would have shared with that kind of a person much much sooner I recognize this part of my story for the first time in sixth grade and I would say that it probably wasn't until sophomore or junior year in college that when I was that I first kind of shared with someone and they didn't respond in a destructive way and it was probably until age 24 that I shared with someone and they actually could help me more than I could help myself and so yeah I think what I'm and I think the reason why that's so important reason why I wish I wish in sixth grade of couple of weeks after I realized this is a part of my story I would have had a parent or a pastor to turn to who had expertise in confidence in ministering well to people like me and because of that confidence they didn't feel an insecurity when someone shared this and we're kind of just trying to quickly fix the problem because the fact that they didn't know how to address this problem made them feel uncomfortable right we sell a lot of pastors appearance feel what when a kid comes to them with this all of a sudden internally that pastor appearing is freaking out because this is a big deal I don't know how to fix this I'm afraid to mess up I want to find a simple solution if instead that pastor that parent has adequate training then they can respond with a non-encious presence and with wisdom that helps suit that child and help guide them to God's wisdom but I think another thing is you know I wouldn't have shared with someone in sixth grade unless I knew that they were a safer in a share with so I would have needed to hear actually before sixth grade someone in my life sharing about God's love and wisdom in age appropriate ways and demonstrating safety to me so that I would it would have felt safe enough for me to share when I was in sixth grade so if I have like one ask for your audience it's don't wait until the teenager in your church comes to you because on average teens still wait five years between when they first recognize same sex attractions versus when they first tell a parent or a pastor and most the time during by the time that five years is up they've already decided what they think about these topics they've already decided what they think God thinks about these topics they've already decided whether or not they they were interested in following God's wisdom or whether they think God existed all they've already probably accrued some wounds of the closet including anxiety loneliness isolation depression suicideality unhelping coping mechanisms you know all of the above if you wait until a kid shares with you it's too late wow so you as parents you as pastors you know in the ideal world need to share with every kid before they go through puberty in careful age appropriate ways about God's love and wisdom for everyone's sexual stewardship and then specifically God's love and wisdom for gay people and encouraged them hey if one if you one day realize that same sex attractions are a part of your story I could would you share with me because you don't have to make sense of this alone and it's not your fault and I'm not going to try to make you straight and I'm not going to shame you and you don't need to be afraid of sharing with me and you don't have to do this alone we can do this together would you please share with me um I wish that's what what have happened for me and I think that's the best thing the parents and pastors can do can do today wow that is so helpful I think probably everybody listening is going thank you thank you I need to be here that so that brings me to another topic and we'll see where where the conversation kind of flows from that so first of all because you've already said suicide rates get higher as people enter into this world of not feeling loved and not feeling accepted and things like that we even experienced that recently on one of our Nazarene campuses I know that I that was nearby and it turns out it was a person who was struggling with some of these things you're talking about today probably didn't feel they had a safe place so above all we need to be interested in saving lives you know on on that regard and I think that's a very Christ like thing for us to do in many ways but the other thing I kind of want to talk about with you because you as a Christian and as one who as as you have explained what you believe to be a traditional sexual ethic and it's it's not everybody who feels that way who comes out of the closet for sure and so we have a lot of people from a lot of different perspectives and I know that um that's a hopefully lead into talking about some of these ways that you're creating community for people who do feel a different calling to a different direction but I know that you would also express you know we talked beforehand maybe we could address some of the things that people with a more progressive view as we talked about before like what are some of the things that that they are bumping up against you know and you had phrased it so much better a little a little while ago when we talked so I might just let you take over just to know that but I know a lot of the argument is and again there's not just one or two arguments there's many on this for sure but one of the arguments is you know what why would God have gay people to deny themselves or to you know look at themselves in any other way than just the way that God made them and things like that why don't you want people to aspire to something more of this and and I'll let you know we may have to continue this conversation a little longer because I'm being told by Zinn we have 10 minutes left so we might have to start a second conversation if we go longer if that's all right with you but if you could maybe just talk a little bit about why for you as a Christian has it taken this path I guess is what I'd like to get to ultimately because you know are really a part of creating community what you're calling like a new monasticism for people with with not a hindrance to who they are but to almost a higher calling to something that God is calling them to a different form of intimacy so I just love to hear your perspective on that if that makes sense don't yeah yeah so so a couple things in there too to to speak too carefully yeah I think I think one of the reasons why maybe non-Christians or or or more progressive Christians kind of bulk at a traditional sexual ethic is sometimes there's well a traditional sexual ethic increases suicide out in gay people and that's that's proof that it can't be how God really thinks about this and one we need to take suicideality really seriously right the statistics earlier that participation in sexual orientation change efforts doubles risk of suicidality that's something we've got to to pay attention to the reality that hiding in the closet feeling like one cannot share about their sexual orientation with parents and pastors and people respond with love and care and compassion definitely increases to a sideality but there is research also that shows that gay people who are Christians and are choosing to steward that in celibacy aren't at a higher risk of suicideality there's actually a book by Mark Yarr House who's a psychologist and a researcher called costly obedience and in this book they do some really thorough research of you know hey is it a mental health or spiritual health liability to be gay and Christian and committed to celibacy and here's a key quote from that book it says on measures of depression anxiety and stress as well as well being our sample gay celibate Christians is doing better than expected most were in the normal range for depression anxiety and stress and on another measure of distress most again scored in the normal range then on a measure of well being most of our sample gay celibate Christians score high in overall life satisfaction and so what research shows is basically gay celibate Christians are having the same mental health outcomes as the average American and are scoring a higher in overall life satisfaction than the average American so I think it's important to tease out okay what are the sources of this higher suicideality it's ultimately not a traditional sexual effort it's it's it's prey the gay away and it's and it's and it's silence in our churches that encourages kids to continue and a closet for many many years but both of those can be rejected while holding on to biblical sexual ethics biblical teaching I think there's lots of other reasons why you know non-Christians or progressive Christians may doubt the the truthfulness the goodness of a traditional sexual ethics on LGBT plus topics but I think one of the big ones is they rarely see in their churches gay people who are Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic and that leading to good and beautiful fruit right a thriving I think if people saw that it would be a lot easier for them to believe that what they read in scripture is true about gay people is really best for gay people and so I think there's a couple of reasons so one I think we need to as the church be honest yes that's true in few of our churches do you see gay Christians thriving according to a traditional sexual ethic now I can get a whole further conversation about how I think when gay Christians follow a progressive sexual ethic there's even worse fruit there's even more destructive results but you know that's a whole other conversation but I want to focus on the truth that recognize the reality that we're not seeing good fruit according to a traditional sexual ethic why we need to own that we'd recognize that and we need to address that so why is that first I think we have a lot of people who are still dealing with lingering wounds of the closet we talked earlier about some of those negative effects of that five-year gap between when a kid first recognizes same-sex attractions which is tells a parent or pastor that's really tough so you got those lingering wounds of the closet I think the second thing is that a lot of our churches are continuing to hold gay people to a high standard of sexual stewardship but then they're kind of fudging the rules compromising a bit bending the rules for straight people you know they're kind of well you know it's really saving sex before marriage reasonable do straight people really need to consider what Jesus and Paul have to say about a lifetime calling of celibacy you know is is an openness to raising children really central to Christian marriage you know is marriage really until death through us part you know doing really have to take what Jesus and Paul had to say about divorce and remarriage seriously right we bend we break those things for straight people but we don't do that for gay people and this double standard creates kind of a poisonous victim mentality for gay people that makes it hard for us to feel like you know the only explanation we can come to for why the Bible is being applied differently to us is homophobia well they just don't like gay people and so I think that is poisonous that needs to make we're negative fruit and makes it hard for gay Christians to steward their sexual out is according to a traditional sexual ethic because because they don't feel like gay straight people are taking a traditional sexual ethics series and sort of undermines makes it easy for the enemy to whisper in their ear and say hey why follow this wisdom no one else is yeah but then I think the third reason and this may actually parlay into kind of more the conversation we want to have is you know some gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic may walk that out by with enduring same sex attractions marrying someone of the opposite sex with with complete honesty with that person about their enduring same sex attractions and navigate the complexity of that kind of a marriage called a mixed orientation marriage that may be a good fit for some people but for a lot of gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic the way they're going to walk that out is celibacy and the reality is few of our churches are places where anyone can do lifelong celibacy for the sake of the kingdom well with reasonable effort regardless of sexual orientation and one of the big resources that is lacking is there's no way there's no place for celibate Christians to find lived in lifelong family in our churches and listen when we go to the scriptures and we see how Jesus and Paul are teaching about this kind of committed singleness for the sake of the kingdom they're not talking about exchanging human intimacy for more God intimacy they're not talking about running away into caves or prayer closets away from the church and not needing any family anymore it consistently when they speak about this committed singleness for the sake of the kingdom they're still talking about it's a call to family it's a call to human family it's a call to human intimacy and so I think that's a third and perhaps even more important the first two reason why we see gay celibate Christians not bearing good fruit in their lives is because they are being starved of the family they need but I don't think the solution is to just discard a traditional sexual ethic and then get them all gay married I think the solution is for us to take seriously with the Bible has to say about committed singleness for the sake of the kingdom for gay people and straight people and to resource them and help them cultivate intentional Christian community where they can find family in celibacy and I think that's a key lever a key work that our churches need to be doing well that's a lot for us to think about right there this is excellent tell you what let's turn this into a two-part conversation if we could today we'll make this the end of part one and and then we'll come back with the continuing topic so you're you're going to get a two podcast thing out of this this will be great to continue the conversation because we've talked about
