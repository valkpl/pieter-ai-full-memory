 Hello friends, welcome back to another episode of Theology in the raw. I have on the show today Peter Volk, who is the president and founder of EQUIP Ministries. EQUIP is a ministry that is designed to help churches become places where LGBT plus Christians can be long and thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic Peter is a graduate of Vanderbilt University. He graduated the highest honors in chemistry. He also did some theological studies at Gordon Conwell, theological seminary. He's a licensed counselor, super, super smart dude, and is doing great, great work through this ministry EQUIP which is based in Nashville, Tennessee. We talk about a lot of stuff in this podcast related to sexuality and singleness and even marriage and marriage. This fascinating community of brothers who he is living with called the Nashville family of brothers. It's kind of like a kind of Protestant, monastic, ish community of people who are called to vocational singleness. It's fascinating what they have going on here. I'm excited for you to engage this conversation and I do encourage you to check out Peter's ministry EQUIP and the National Family of Brothers.

So, alright, without further ado, I want you to welcome to the show for the first time my good friend Peter Volk. Alright, hey friends, welcome back to another episode of Theology and the raw. I'm here with my friend Peter Volk. Peter, thanks so much for being on the show, man. Yeah, glad to be here. So, why don't we get, why don't you just give us short backstory to who you are and how you kind of fell into, how you would start began this ministry at E. Quip and Nashville. And then I really want to spend some time talking about the national family of brothers. I think that's just such an interesting unique thing that you guys have going on. And I get a lot of questions in my own work about something like what you guys are doing. And so I often point people to to the national family of brothers as an example of a of a possibility of vocational, singleness and community. So, yeah, who is Peter Volk and tell us about exodus or exodus. Oh, man. He quip. Not exodus. No worries. Yeah, so long story short. I'm a Christian and I'm gay and I'm a convinced of a traditional sexual ethic that God best for for me and for every Christian is either a lifetime commitment of abstinent singleness for the sake of doing a kingdom work or a lifetime commitment to Christian marriage between a man and a woman to raise kids for the kingdom. And I think that's God's best for for me too. And so a lot of my life has been making sense of my sexuality and God's wisdom and how to make that work together. So much so that I felt like I was calling you to be a part of that work of teaching parents and pastors how to better love and serve people like me according to a traditional sexual ethics. So that's my day job. I run a ministry called Equip and we partner with churches to help them become places where gay people can belong and thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic. And then I'm also a licensed professional counselor and I meet with a for like a half day week with clients navigating questions of faith and sexuality. And then in addition to that, I'm part of helping build the Nashville family of brothers. We are a monastery, an intentional Christian community, a brotherhood. We're men called to vocational single nests for the sake of the kingdom can find lived in permanent family. And I really believe in this conversation about discernment and how those invocational single nests can find family in our churches and and here. The story is in scripture about their pathway in scripture or excuse me in church. So yeah, that's a little bit about me. Now I love how casually you're talking, but as you know, you have said probably five very controversial things. Let me let me just run through those. You have no problem calling yourself gay. Why why and you and I on the same page with that, I, you know, obviously, if you're committed to vocational single nests because of the Christian sexual ethic. Your gain is is not your ultimate identity, Jesus is your ultimate identity, but have you. Why are you okay using term gay rather than I, you know, I struggle with same section tracks and or something like that, you know, the debate I'm referring to. Yeah, the well, my primary audience, the people I speak to or on behalf of our kids in our churches who will run day realize the experience same sex attraction or teenagers in our churches who are gay. And I want to use the language that the they're most familiar with that they're going to hear in school and I want to teach parents and pastors to use the to know how to use the words that that their kids are using. Because there's so many barriers already to inviting our kids to steer their sexuality, according to a traditional sexual ethic. I hate for language to be just another barrier just another reason for gay teens to think what God has to say is irrelevant so. Okay, good. You also said did this is a finer point that I did notice though. You said that the traditional sexual ethic is not just I've heard some people say, you know, this is what God's calling me to, but you made it more objective like this is what God's calling all of his followers to do you use that language intentionally. I've heard people say, no, you know, I'm called the signals, but they don't want to take the next step to say, no, all people are called to. Celebrity in single and less and less they are called in into marriage. Was that intentional description of. The ethic. Yeah, I mean, I do think it's God's best for for all Christians and that's why I'm convinced of it and and I because I think it's God's best. Lot of these and is not just God's best, but God's best, that gives usもの. Does God always thinks God actually gave up our wife and knows God's best, does he own my have some more progressive people than you were I elicited the podcast. It's funny on the spectrum of evangelicalism. My podcast seems to be for some people as liberal as they will go. And then for other people, I'm as conservative as they are. I mean, yeah, yeah. So I quite enjoy that interesting space, but some people are just on the category for the gods' best. Like, okay, maybe it's maybe you think it's morally right. Maybe you are interpreting scripture that way, but you cannot say that this is like the best way to be human to deny your desires for another person and a consensual relationship. Like, I'm sure you get that. How would you respond to that? Yeah, I guess I don't know anything with certainty. But I also don't want to just make myself guide and trust that I know what's best for me. And so I'm seeking the scriptures. I'm seeking the wisdom of the church through reason and through experience. What is most likely to be God's best for all people, including me? But if it's in a mind convinced that that's God's best for me, it just makes sense that I'd offer that to others. And there's ideas here that are mutually exclusive with each other. There's some ways in which a traditional sexual ethic and a progressive sexual ethic can't be true at the same time. God can't be of both minds. And so we've got is of one mind. I want to know of which mind God is. And then I want to offer that to the people I love. In your journey, did you ever consider or become almost convinced of maybe a more progressive sexual ethic? I'm sure you, I mean, I know you're a very intelligent person, you're very, very, you know, you're going to study something to the depths, you know, I think is how your wife's home, why are to sell your wife? Just briefly, what was your journey like? As you know, I'm sure you weighed an affirming progressive position. Yeah, I mean, I'd say growing up, I held a traditional sexual ethic 50% of because of what the Bible said and 50% because of cultural pressure. And then God has just been really faithful that over time, God has replaced that 50% belief from cultural pressure with 50% more, you know, healthy conviction of this is what God has to say through scriptures and through the church. And a lot of that journey has been me wanting a progressive sexual ethic to be true and me giving the best argument for a progressive sexual ethic that best chance it could have of changing my mind because it would certainly be more convenient for me. And then every time I do that, I just become more deeply convinced of what the church has taught historically. Now, I certainly made plenty of mistakes in my lifetime. I've been convinced intellectually and theology of a traditional sexual ethic consistently. Unfortunately, I'm a sinner. And I've inconsistent with unfathomably at times, lived that out. So I want to make that clear. Yeah, unfortunately, yeah, us straight people, we actually have nailed it. We don't, yeah, we really don't fall short of God's standard. Great, obviously, these are guys. OK, one other thing you said, and then we'll get to the meat of the conversation. I actually, I like, although, well, I do like, and I'm intrigued by your way of framing marriage. You have your call to celibacy in signalness. And but you said, and yet, there's those who are called to a male female marriage. But you said, for the purpose of raising kids for the kingdom, that sounds very, very Catholicish. And I've had this conversation publicly a few times. And I'm actually leaning more toward that direction where I'm at now. I would say, well, first of all, did you intentionally say it that way? Which you're not known to be unintentional in your language. So I'm going to assume you asked it. Is that your understanding of marriage that raising kids is part of that vocation? It is much as it's possible. I mean, these things about that. Yeah, I would say raised children and not necessarily bear children. Because there are many couples that are painful, painful dealing with the reality of infertility. And I don't want them to hear that I think they're a lesser marriage because they're unable to bear children. But it does seem like, through the teachings of scripture or the church historically, that marriage is a vehicle in part for raising kids for the sake of kingdom. Now, that's not the only good or beautiful thing about marriage. Obviously, it's a space to enjoy intimacy and the context of family. Obviously, it's an image that teaches us about the love in the Trinity and between Christ and the church. But I think the vocational single list is also a call to enjoy healthy intimacy and the context of human family. And I think vocational single list is also a call to in unique ways be an image, a reflection of the love in the Trinity between Christ and the church. So the reason why I describe vocational single-ness and Christian marriage in the way I do is I want to point out what unique about them, right? And I think what unique about Christian marriage is that it is a space to raise children for the sake of the kingdom. And what's unique about vocational single-ness is it's a call to give up romance, sex, marriage, kids. In order to have this availability to do kingdom work, the parents might not have the time, energy, or financial freedom to do, recognizing that raising kids is that obviously in a central and awesome kingdom work. But I've got parents and married friends with kids who recognize that it's a full-time job being a parent. And there's lots of key to work out there to be done that they just don't have the time or energy to do because they drew that important work of raising kids. Yeah, that's good. I was raised traditional low church evangelical where procreation was over here in sexes over here. And just up until the invention of the pill, that never was even like sex and marriage and procreation were all one part of the same discussion. And even, I mean, just through natural odds, obviously whoever created this thing called sex kind of built in a component of procreation that's sort of intertwined with it and maybe there's theological reasons for that. I'm not quite like, I don't. What would you say about it? I don't want to get too far. This isn't really why one had me on, but you thought through this. And I don't have a lot of people that I think are Protestant, but thinking similar to what I, how I'm at least processing. What would you say to say like a couple and old age, past age of child-ranging, they've been single to whole life then they get married and having biological kids is not really a possibility. And maybe they're like, yeah, we don't really feel like we want to adopt kids at 55 years all to whatever. Would you say that that's kind of like an exception to the rule? Or would you say no? And then if you're not called to have raised kids, maybe you're not called to marriage, or how would you respond to that? Yeah, definitely exception to the rule category are space there. So yeah, when I gave that kind of more teased out definition of a traditional sexual I think in God's best for all Christians, it was kind of as a rule. This is what it looks like. And there are exceptions to the rule. So including, for example, there will be a lot of family families that are infertile and will prayerfully explore with God. God, you still want us to adopt kids, to foster kids, do you want us to not raise kids in that way, but be involved in our church family, and with this capacity. So yeah, there are definitely exceptions either. Let me speak on behalf of my progressive friends we're listening right now. Well Peter, you make an exception for that when you make an exception for a gay couple that's committed to each other, that this isn't maybe the general pattern of marriage and scripture, but maybe they want to adopt four or five kids and there's plenty of needs for adoption and there's not enough straight couple or heterosexual couples to go around to adopt all these kids, like, why would you say that is outside the bounds of an exception to the rule? Sure. Yeah, so it makes sense to have some people called to vocational singleness. May still be, and celibacy, may still be called to foster adopt. I mean, we certainly see that in the history of the church, none's where the people running the orphanages. So, you know, as a rule vocational singleness isn't a space to foster an adopt kids, but there are gonna be some, some people call the vocational singleness who are called to raise kids and that may be a gay person called the vocational singleness. That may be a couple of gay people called to vocational singleness and living together and kind of they see themselves as a family unit and raise some kids together. Not telling that kid or their church that they think they're doing as marriage, but they are as a community helping raise some kids. But it does seem to me, if we look at the wisdom and scripture and what God says is best and what God says is sin will lead us to pain and destruction and it doesn't seem like that's on accommodation God could make. But I think these questions about consistency from more progressive folk is really important because it's true if we're gonna make accommodations or we're gonna kind of ignore what scriptures wisdom is for straight people that we need to be willing to do that for gay people. Or if we think God's wisdom really matters and we just can't, we can't fudge this line for gay people well maybe we need to have a similar conversation when it comes to street people and channeled rearing and under the divorce and second mirror just for Christians and all that kind of stuff. But anyway, I don't wanna open up more cans of worms. No, I think, yeah, you can't see. You already did by referencing it. And I'm just gonna let my audience linger on it and I'll linger on it because I do want to get into but just to make sure I heard you write, you would be on paper, like you would not say it's outside the bounds to have to sell a gay people, raising kids together, not as a married couple but as a committed friendship and then they're both as a community raising kids. Is that, I just wanna make sure I heard you write. Yeah, I mean, as we'll probably get to, I think the, I think if you wiser if there's more than two adults in the house, I think it's hard when people are paired for them not to, to see some exclusivity in their, in their friendship and for that exclusivity not to invite them to think of the other romantically. So I think it's probably, would, would maybe wiser for them to be a community of more than two and, but yeah, I know of some people who are gay and people of the same sex and who live in the same house together, sleeping different beds, sleeping different bedrooms, invite accountability from their church about their relationship, are clear to their kids and to their church, we don't see ourselves as married in the eyes of God but we see ourselves as friends and who got us calling us to help raise the foster or foster anodopte these kids that others won't and that won't have a family if we don't. Do you think that that's confusing for the kid, like, or is that just kind of one of the, like, when the kid interpret that as I have two dads and I mean, it's not like the kid knows whether or not they're engaging in a sexual relationship. I mean, yeah, I mean, probably would require those, those two parents to be really clear in age appropriate ways what this is, what this isn't. And yeah, it may be times that it's confusing but I don't as, as you speak to a lot in different contexts, we're not gonna be able to avoid confusing images for our kids, so we can be prepared to provide clarity and wisdom. All right, well, I gotta think about that. That's, yeah, that's, I get the question about celibate partnerships quite a bit. What do you think about two single people committed to celibacy who are, and the terminology differs with the question. I'm not comfortable with the term partnership just because that does convey in our culture today, a sexual relationship, but a covenanted friendship or something like that, I think is not only okay, I think it's beautiful and very biblical, obviously. And I think, I wish we had more covenanted friendships just across the board among humans, especially the church. So I think friendships are too fleeting and too non-commiddle, but I think that's problematic. So, okay, so let's transition, I don't know my audience is like, what about this, what about that? But I, well, if I get, it looks like it's a really briefly, right? I mean, as a rule, I think the best way in space to do vocational single, this is the way I described it earlier. And yeah, I think it's challenging, if you're in a, I think sometimes celibate partnerships seem to invite romance, even they say, oh, we can enjoy romance as long as we enjoy sexual activity. Or they see what they're doing as a replacement for marriage in some way and exclusivity is something they want. And they wouldn't allow others to join this kind of community of two to become a community of three, four, five, six. And I think there's ways in which that seems to me incompatible with the model of spiritual friendship we see in Scripture. That's not what I'm suggesting. But yeah, I mean, as well as I know we'll get to, I live in a community of men, who hold each other accountable, who don't see ourselves as partnered or paired in any way. And I think this is a really healthy way for people to live out vocational, single, and some find healthy family. Well, yeah, let's dive in there. So yeah, the national family brothers, described what that is, how it came about, and how it's going. Yeah, so three or four years ago, I felt convinced that God was calling me to commit in a permanent way to the kind of singleness that Jesus and Paul talks about. But I was curious how I was going to find, the family, I needed to do that well. How I was going to meet my intimacy needs and healthy ways. And I was talking to the pastor at my church about that. And I'm really thankful for his honesty. He said, you know, Peter, unfortunately, I don't know if you're going to find the experience of family you need at our church, or any church in Nashville anytime soon. But I think you should go build it. And he said, monasticism has been the most common way that celibate people have found family. It's been the greatest source of theology in the church. It's been the greatest source of evangelism in the church. It's been the greatest source of social justice in the church. It's been the greatest source of, I'm missing one. I did a case in the theology event with justice. Okay. And anyway, so he said, maybe you should consider you and some friends should consider starting something like that. So it began with just some Monday night dinners and us asking God, are you calling us to commit to lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom? Are you calling us to start some kind of intentional Christian community together to be a space to do that well? So fast forward to now. We've got five guys living in a house together. And we have each made either about to make one year commitments or have made one year commitments or have made three year commitments to this community. And we are all committed to vocational singleness for the sake of the kingdom committed to celibacy. We do prayer together every morning. We do confession once a week together. We do three meals a week together. And we do some monthly rhythms of kind of praise and worship together. And we do some holidays and vacations together. We have alternate Thanksgivings and Christmas with our biological family versus the Nashville family of brothers. So kind of, when you imagine, well, what does anyone do between their five PM and their nine A.M.? Where do they go find family? Where do they spend their weekends? Well, this is where we do that. And eventually, we hope, you know, brothers in a stepwise way what might make lifetime commitments to this community. It's one of the things that's going different. Go ahead. It is one of the criteria to be a part of the family of brothers that you have to be same sex attracted, gay, or is it just you have to be committed to singleness for life or for a season. So I guess there's three different questions. A lifelong singleness, seasonal singleness, you have to be gay. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, this is a space for any Christian man who feels called to vocational singleness to find family, regardless of sexual orientation. And we have had people of a variety of sexual orientations who have discerned and who are a part of this. And we, brothers make one year commitments and then three year commitments and then lifetime commitments to the Nashville family and brothers. Although if they don't feel enough confidence to kind of take the next step, they can repeat that one year or that three year. But we are about, we do want to be on a trajectory towards lifetime commitments, both to sell to the and to this community. So that's what we're about there. So maybe it sounds a little bit like a monastery and a kind of a whole school way. But there's always we're different than like a typical monastery. We're still a part of our local churches. And we're actually from a variety of denominations. So we've got some Catholic guys that have just earned some Anglican guys, some PCA guys, some Baptist and non-denominational, some church-acrised. So there's a lot of variety here. And all of us have jobs outside of our home. Like we're not monks who are making bread and cheese or doing some kind of like nine to five prayer ministry. A lot of us have non-ministry jobs outside of the home. So yeah. And so just to clarify, oh, would you allow a female or no? You have to be a male. So for a variety of reasons, we think that God's calling us to be kind of a community of men. And that's what the pastor's who are providing oversight for what we're doing, think would be wise. This would be that we've been praying for God to raise up a national family of sisters that would kind of parallel what we're doing and that we would have a really healthy relationships with. What are some of the challenges? Like what are some of the challenges and also maybe some of the blessings and being in part of this community? Yeah. I think the hardest part is that we don't have a lot of models for how to do this well. There's no one kind of handing us a formula of, this is the wisest way to do vocational singleness in a more ordinary way and still find committed, lived in family with in kind of a single sex community of other cello but people. We don't have a formula for that. So we're kind of having to figure it out as we go and borrow some from history and borrow some from other traditions and also discern and pray with pastors involved. So I think that's the hardest part is, is we're having to kind of trail some, blaze some new trails. But I think what's really beautiful is, a number of us have realized, maybe some people call to sell a seat, have this even bigger gift of cello bussy that they don't really need human intimacy as much anymore. But at least all of the many who've discerned the national family brothers feel like, that's not the version of the gift of cello bussy we got. We still need some kind of healthy human intimacy and we need that in a ways that's consistent that we can depend on. It's not just a revolving door of roommates. We need something or permanent, you know? And I would say I think God's made all of us for a permanent human family to help teach us about the permanence of God's love and the Trinity between Christ and the Church. So I think that need for some kind of faithful permanent lived in family love is intentional. I think that's I think we're made for that. Right. So I think what's really beautiful is that we actually have hope that we're gonna find that. When many of our peers who think they're called, if you're like called a cello bussy, are worried about, well, who am I gonna come home to from work or from plane flight 10 years from now? You know, will I be alone in my 50s, my 60s? Yeah. Who will hold my hand when I'm dying? We have hope for who those people are right now. And that's really special. I mean, we're spoiled in many ways because I know so many people either who have called the single nurse or who have kind of an involuntary, single nurse who live in like dread and fear of those things. And we've got hope that that the God's offering is something different. So there's I'm sure a lot of people listening. There's a question that people are thinking of. They might not even would ask it publicly. But how do you guys, I don't know, mitigate or not mitigate, but navigate the, let me just say it like the potential for sexual attraction towards each other. I mean, the only parallel I can give is somebody whose opposite sex attracted is if I was single living in a house with, you know, I mean, I guess I can almost compare it to living in a house with like five other single women or something. Doesn't mean just because I'm straight, I'm totally attracted to every single woman I see, most I'm not. But I mean, yeah, what if a couple of them were pretty attractive and like how would I, I can imagine that that would be, you know, there'd be a difficulty there. And so yeah, how do you guys manage that? Yeah. So I don't see personally same sex attraction as just opposite sex attraction, but a switch has been flipped. OK. I think it's a different kind of thing. And I think it's, you know, more helpful to think of these are like different switches that are separated from each other. One is not influenced the other. So so and one the way that same sex attractions are different, at least in my experience is that when I lean into healthy friendship with other men, even if they're men that I might be, like recognized are physically attractive. When I lean into healthy friendship with them, my desire for something romantic or sexual with them seems to kind of be less temporarily. And what's with that suggests to me is that what I really am desiring with those people is not something romantic or sexual, but is something chased, is something intimate, but something non-romantic and non-sexual. And then I only perceive that as romantic or sexual when I'm, when I'm not meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways. It kind of gets skewed. It kind of gets off a bit. And so in the national family brothers, we try to be intentional about having healthy friendships with each other and leaning into healthy intimacy. And that seems to be the best way to kind of push away the possibility, the risk of romantic or sexual activity in any way. We also, I mean, we practice daily prayer and confession together. And we believe a lot and as early or early as we can, shining a light on the potential for some things like this. And we have an advisory board of pastors and natural who provide oversight for what we do. And so we also are seeking wisdom from them and seeking accountability from them and confessing to them if we think there's even a possibility of something like this in our community. And then as you've probably talked about, just we talk about sexual sewerage for any people. If we draw the battle lines even farther from that and our diligent there, we're less likely to have issues when it comes to actually kind of crossing boundaries as another person. So what I mean is, if we're having honest conversations about a pornography and masturbation and really holding that line and really holding each other accountable to that, that's where we're really doing battle. Honestly, we're much less likely to be strongly tempted by crossing boundaries with another person. You should know what I'm saying. Yeah. Lacks boundaries, lacks kind of sexual purity when it comes to pornography masturbation makes it easier for us to be tempted in a strongly with actually acting out with another person. But if we push against that line, even kind of push the battle front even farther away from those kinds of things, yeah, it seems to be safer. Well, if I can, yeah, to tease out your thoughts or make sure falling to you, I mean, I could imagine somebody who would potentially be concerned about a bunch of game in, living together in a house. I think I would push them to at least consider the opposite. I game in and live myself. Is that going to reduce his temptation, his susceptibility to fall sexually? Because we can find sex pretty easily this day, like if we actually, but again, if you're living a healthy mature Christian life, which obviously sounds like you guys are pursuing pretty vigorously. I don't know too many straight Christians who are having daily prayers and confession in a community together, like that seems pretty awesome. So it seems like the spiritual health. When you guys are spiritually healthy, and again, I appreciate you saying we're not perfect, whatever, but like gosh, you're certainly making an priority. It seems like that would reduce the temptation, the need, the really kind of acting on your attractions, rather than if you're just all isolated in single. Yeah, you gave a better answer than I did. That's the answer. Yeah, what we're not seeking is a risk-free way to do community because that doesn't exist. The better question is will this lead to more sexual purity than living alone? And the answers. Yes, that. Well, I just came to my head. When I wasn't college, I just recently got saved. I was really hungry and for Christian fellowship came out of the world where I was like, man, I need to be around some good Christian guys, but I didn't want to be around, like I was an athlete, I was that guy in high school, you know, and some Christian groups, I went to him like, I gotta be friends with these people. I know, it was hard for me, you know? I get to my Christian college, and there's loads of just amazing people, like just. And I got put in one of the dorm rooms, a little shout out to slight room number four, if anybody's listening from Master's University. And a slight was the name of the dorm, and they had communal, had like four to six people per room. So it was like an old married housing where there were like two rooms, bunk beds. So I was gonna room with maybe four of their guys. And we happened to just become friends instantly, even to this day we keep in touch. Yes, rich, we step up with a two-and-a-morning plan, praying for each other, deep-feel, a lot of good conversations, laughing, to the point of tears, all this stuff. And I remember, you know, if I think back now, and obviously I'm a single guy at a Christian school, so I'm on the prowl to find my wife, whatever, as every Christian school is, you know. But I remember times when I'm like, I would rather be with my guys right now than out on campus, you know, talking to a girl right now, because the intimacy, the depth, the fellowship was so rich in life, given them like, I wanna be with my guys right now, like this is just. And so I guess that's the only kind of comparison I could have to which you guys may be experienced to where deep, non-sexual intimacy can mitigate, aberrant sexual desires, or even sexual desires in general. Because there's a connection there, right? Between, I feel like sexual desire is a subset of a larger need for intimacy, so when that large need for intimacy is met, it has an effect on the kind of level of sexual desire that you have to kind of discipline, if that makes sense. Does that make sense? The connection was a little spotty. Okay, sorry, so, what would you say that sexual desire is a subset of a deeper desire for intimacy, and so when that deeper desire for non-sexual intimacy is met, it has an effect on the level, or adequate, you know, the management of your sexual desire in healthy ways. Yeah, so I've definitely seen, I mean, obviously I've got a lot of friends who are not gay, I've got a lot of friends who are straight and Christian, and it's definitely been their testimony that even while they're married, when they are not seeking out healthy friendship with other men, in addition to their healthy marriage relationship, they seem to have more problems with temptation for pornography and masturbation. But when they are both seeking healthy relationship and intimacy with their wife, and they're seeking healthy friendship with other men, they seem to have better victory over temptation for pornography and masturbation. So yeah, I think kind of regardless of sexual orientation, meeting our intimacy needs in healthy ways and same sex friendship and opposite sex friendship, that's the formula. You know, I find oftentimes straight, or sorry, yes, straight Christian married couples tried to squeeze more intimacy out of the marriage than marriage is actually designed to do. So they try to invest all over their intimate needs there, not in friendship. And that's when I, this is where five years ago, I wouldn't have said this, but getting to know healthy, celibate gay Christians who are pursuing and who are in healthy intimate relationships with other guys or girls, depending on who they are. They've taught me about the mind need for healthy friendships because yeah, I don't, again, five years ago, when I said this, but I don't think all of our emotional spiritual needs can be or should be met in a marriage. I don't think that's the design for, I don't think that's why God created marriage was to exhaust all of our intimate needs as humans. Would you agree with that? I mean, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I wonder if there'd be less divorce in the church if we did friendship better because we had more reason to relax expectations of our spouse and we weren't expecting them to be perfect in some way or need all of our needs and then kind of moving on to someone else because they weren't enough. So yeah, that's good, that's good. So I'm just thinking like, you know, I talked a lot of churches that are like, man, how can we, as a church come alongside our gay or same-sex attractive brothers and sisters, especially those pursuing signalness. And then when we do think, do you think of churches kind of sponsored houses like this? Like if they had a house, maybe they even offset some of the costs or just made it very like, hey, we want to go out of our way to create an opportunity for something like this to happen. Is that something you've seen churches do or would you, or would you, maybe would you like to see churches do take the lead on this kind of communal housing? Yeah, I think that'd be great. I mean, so the beginning of the story I shared about the National Family of Brothers was my pastor, kind of inspiring, giving the idea for this. And he's been involved throughout this process in kind of coaching us and processing with us. And we are dealing with difficult moments. And when we've made kind of public commitments to to celibacy and to the community and to family and to the kind of the way of life that we do together, we did those in a church and he was there and he was in his collar and he laid hands on each of us individually as we went up and kind of made those commitments to those gathered. Really? This was a public kind of church thing that was going on. Wow, that's awesome. That's fantastic. We had a big reception afterwards. And because we're in an annual church, we had alcohol and so we had some drinks and plates and games and had some music playing and it was a really good time. So yeah, I think church is going to be a big part of this. And I think it's really important. I think these communities will be healthier and this work will be healthier or churches. If they don't frame this as the solution for gay people, but instead they frame this as the solution for those called to celibacy regardless of their sexual orientation. And invite more stray people to consider if they might be called to the single-ness of Jesus or Paul. So I think when we can move this out, we can kind of disconnect celibacy from being gay. It will be a healthier thing for celibus, straight people and gay people. Yeah, that's good. That's, I'm not sure the Protestant church is ready for that. I think it. But have you met maybe more or any single-strait people who would like to be in a relationship? It's not like they are just hyper-interverts, but they're like, no, I feel called to pursue celibacy. Have you, do you know anybody like that? That's straight. Yeah, definitely some. I mean, I have a number of straight friends right now who are considering that possibility who are discerning that, who are asking that question of God. Do you want me to kind of live single for the sake of the kingdom for a time? Do you want me to commit to living single to take the kingdom for longer? There's obviously we know that the marriage rates in our churches are going down. And I think some churches have responded to that by saying, well, we need to just push, push marriage more and push everyone, push marriage is the only option. And they're afraid that any conversation about the possibility of vocational single-ness leads to less people getting married. And what I want to suggest is if we invited all of the younger adults in our churches to intentionally discern where their God is calling them to marriage or vocational single-ness and really push them to ask God what God's best might be for them. That only to more people getting married and more people committing to vocational single-ness for the sake of the kingdom. Because we need more of both, right? We need less Christians kind of languishing in uncommitted single-ness in our churches. And we need more Christian marriage and more committed single-ness. And I think discernment is the way to do that. Yeah, man, that's good. I read a study somewhere or a survey what we'll back it like for the first time in modern history the percentage of single people of marital age has surpassed a percentage of married people of marital age. And this is a society not in the church. And the church it might be not that high. But either way, I'm going to church to doesn't have a robust theology of singleness is going to be profoundly irrelevant. To 50%. I think the percentage is like 50% of people are single and marital age. Maybe 22 to 38 or something like that. They're still single. Maybe they get married later on or whatever. Maybe they don't at all. But yeah, I think more than ever, I'm preaching to the choir here. But I think we've long overdue to cultivate a healthier theology of singleness. I mean, the fact that, and I've said this before, the fact that Jesus was a married, a single man of marital age has serious theological significance. And I think the, I'll just flat out say, I think the heretical Christian assumption is what Jesus, he can't get married enough sex, it's like, wait, wait, since when did marriage in sex within marriage become sin? Was not a genus as one or two thing? Was not the very first commandment, be fruitful multiply, this Jesus not have the possibility as a sinless savior to get married and bear children or whatever. I know like it's messy, but we can't say, oh, it's because he's God why he didn't get married. Like he, you know, I was like, well, he was also 100% man. And anyway, I think that there's theological significance for Jesus a single list that we have not appreciated as a Protestant church. The Anglican church, I wonder, because Anglican has kind of a couple toes in the Catholic world, it seems like, at least in practice and theology a little bit, do you find the Anglican church have it a better theology of singleness? A little bit, or at least there are some abilities make them a little less afraid of Catholic seeming things. And there is, there's there, there's a history of Anglican and Episcopal kind of monasteries and monks and that kind of stuff. So it's a mix, it's a mix, yeah. There was a recent statement, you sent it to me and that triggered my thought. I don't know if I looked at it. Was there a recent statement on, I'm gonna try and pull it up here, the Anglican church and, let's see if I have it here. No, that's not it, you know, I'm talking about right? Oh yeah, right here. Dear gay, there's a kind of social guide. What, what, what, can you drop around all that? I don't know if we, if it, how helpful would we be to contribute? Oh, really okay, can you maybe don't give an opinion, but can you explain what it is and what the drama is? You feel comfortable doing that or just from a neutral standpoint? Oh, yeah, I can say briefly that, I mean, as we've probably seen over the past five or six years, a number of conservative mainline Protestants denominations have felt the need, both to reaffirm a traditional sexual ethic and particularly comment on this kind of a sexuality identity language conversation. I would say for the sake of kind of culture war pressures and the Southern Baptist Convention did that with the national statement and the PCA did that with the PCA report and so the Anglo-Contourism in North America have recently done that with a kind of denominational level statement that came out about two months ago and there's some of us in the Anglo-Contourism North America who were afraid how that denominational statement might be perceived particularly by gay agnostic, curious about getting to know Jesus and an Anglo-Contourism and gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethics. So we recently tried to send a positive message to those audiences in particular to let them know that there are Anglo-Contourism where they are welcome and where their language won't be police. But yeah, that's a whole longer conversation. Yeah, not fine. And I don't want to draw you into something here publicly, but so the statement is it's an Anglo-Conversion, it's an Anglo, this is a bad way of saying it, but I'll just say it and into the emails later. It's an Anglo-Conversion of the national statement or an Anglo-Conattent to do their own kind of like, here's our public statement is that, okay. Yeah, yeah, or an Anglo-Conversion of the PCA report that came out last March. Yeah, it is. I have an analog to those two in a way. Yeah. The CRC Christian Reform Church is going through a lot of stuff and they've really statements more, I think for internal use. And yeah, I think a lot of, I'm sure they are CA, I know they're reformed church of America, they're going through stuff. So yeah, this is man, yeah, my her goes out to these denominations, man, that's not easy to manage. This conversation, you know, and the role of statements is particularly touchy. Statements are, they lack oftentimes relational sensitivity and nuance, the typically have committees or in charge of them. People are in different spectrums, then you have the politics, denominational politics and money and old guard and young guard. It's just, it's, I don't envy people who are involved in that sort of thing. To get a bunch of people across the spectrum of kind of views to agree on a single statement, not my cup of tea man, but yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I'll take it out, work when you find it, because I do need to read through it. Dear gay Anglicans, is that the, or no? Yeah, so that, that's some of the controversy is, there was an open letter signed by two bishops and five different canon theologians and a bunch of Anglican clergy and the open letter was hosted on deargayanglicans.com. And then for a variety of denominational politics reasons, we were asked to take it down and, and complied with that request from a bishop. So, it's, it's complicated. I can send you kind of privately, a URL to a Webarchive of the letter if you're curious and I can send you a URL to the, the denominational statement that came out two months ago that is in some ways related. Okay, yeah, yeah, I like to, I just like to be kind of where it was going on, but yeah, sure. Anything. Workin' people find you and your work. Yeah, talk just really quickly before we close about EQUIP and if anybody's in the Nashville area, they absolutely need to know about your ministry there. So, yeah, tell us a bit about how they can get a whole of you. Yeah, our website is EQUIPYourCommunity.org and you can email us at info at equipyourcommunity.org and then I think, our, we're on Instagram and Facebook and I think the handles are at EQUIPYourCommunity.org or excuse me, at EQUIPYourCommunity are the handles. And then yeah, if you wanna stay in touch with, with with kind of me and the ways that I'm speaking into some of these topics, my handles on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are my first name and then my middle initial L and then my last name. So, PIE, TER, L, V is in Victor, ALK. And but if you have particularly curious about this Nashville family of brothers idea, we, you can go to family of brothers.org. And you can also find us on Facebook or Instagram and I think our handle is at Nashville family of brothers. Hard to keep up with all the handles, man. Yes, there's a lot. I'm curious, there might be some people listening. They're like, dude, I would move to Nashville. If I can be a part of this, is that, have you had people hear about it from a distance and wanna fly and move to Nashville just to be a part of this? And is that a possibility for people? Are you guys maxed out? Yeah, we've got a guy in the house right now who moved here from Chicago a year ago. Okay. Got a guy in the house right now who moved here from Dallas three months ago. We've got a guy who might move here from Chattanooga in a couple of months and the guy who might move from Orlando in half a year. So, yeah, with love for people to reach out, we kind of have a formal way that people explore from a distance, whether the Nashville family brothers is for them, they read through our community covenant with us and they join us for some discernment discussions and get to know some of the brothers. And particularly as we get a little farther into kind of people getting vaccinated and we invite people to come hang out with us for kind of weekend retreats to get to know current brothers. So, yeah, so there's, we definitely want this to grow. Also, if there's anyone out there who says, this sounds great, but I'd like to start this in my city with some people I know, I would love for there to be a, you know, Lizula family of brothers and a land of family of brothers and a Boston family of brothers and an LA family of brothers. So, if anyone's interested in starting something similar and you want any help kind of brainstorming that or even some, I can have you to provide some free coaching toward that to make that happen. I would love, I mean, we need these kinds of solutions in our cities and available to our churches. So, I'd love to help however I can. Thanks, Peter, for being on theology and raw. You guys check out his work. It's great stuff. Especially if you're in the national community, the greater national area, if you're volting the church, we're love to dive into the conversation out, face sexuality and gender. I mean, I know Peter's ministry pretty well and they just do amazing, amazing work. So if you're, yeah, if you're a church to once they bring Peter in, check out his website and you can go from there. So thanks so much, Peter, for being on theology and raw, man. Thanks for having me.
