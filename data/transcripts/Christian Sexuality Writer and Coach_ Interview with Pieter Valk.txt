 Rich songs are out of no focus from theuguest lines here I'm with you. Welcome. Hi, Tim. Hi, Peter. Guess what? I am in the UK right now. So I am in a little bit different timeframes than I usually am. But I'm with consistent with you, Tim. Yep. Yeah. It's like she's up north, up north with the mysterious james. So he's time to see that. So today on the show, we have Peter Volk. I think it's Peter Volk, isn't it? I think you're Peter L. Is it Peter L Volk on social media? Yes. There's lots of other people. So I'm just a little bit like it. Well, I'll be honest. It's mostly because someone had already bought the PIE-TERVA-OK.com URL. So I had to find somewhere to get a different URL. And then they're going to consistent across all platforms. So that's why the L is there. Yeah. So we briefly recapitulate. I was like the word recapitulate. I'll discuss and just before the show started, how would you describe yourself in terms of what you do? I had to stand by going it down here. But you're not somebody who can be easily described in three words. Sure. Maybe use like 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 words. Sure. And describe what you do and letting people know what this interview would be. Yeah. So I mean, I'd say in a sentence, I like to help churches love gay people better according to a traditional sexual ethic and help sell a bit Christians find family. And I'd be just writing and speaking around those topics. I'm a teacher and an aspiring a deacon in the Anglican church in North America. And I'd help start an intentional Christian community for men committed to vocational singleness. And I also on a licensed professional counselor here in the states. So I got my hands on lots of baskets. Yeah. Okay. So I have a couple of questions. Sure. Why are your topics so important to both our UK audience and our American audience? Yeah. Also, I mean, I think for people who are kind of believers studies consistently show that while, you know, maybe four or five, 10% of people in our churches are LGBTQ plus people. When you ask people who are not Christians or people who have not attending church anymore, kind of, what is your biggest barrier to attending church to giving Jesus a first chance or a second chance, consistent with what they share is their perception of Christians treatment of gay people. Is the number one barrier to people getting to know Jesus going back to church? You know, so even if it's a small percentage of people who attend our churches, it has an outside impact on kind of whether people feel like Jesus and the church has something good to offer them. And so I think that's why this topic matters. And that's not just that's particularly true in the states and I suspect that you there are similar stats, similar perceptions in in face faces and UK, but I'll leave that to you guys. So when it's mind back a bit, why do you think that Christianity in general has such an issue with homosexuality? Do you think it's actually in the teachings of the Bible? Or do you think it's the people at the time didn't like homosexuality? I'm not sure why it kind of grew out of that. What's your view on a historical perspective? Yeah, so if you're asking a question of why is there so much division today? Yeah. I think a great book is a book called Still Time to Love or Still Time to Care. I can't remember which one. But if I got name Greg Johnson and he outlined this whole trajectory in the US and the UK starting with kind of before the AIDS crisis with how John stopped and Francis, shape or in Billy Graham, we're speaking into how modern Christians should think about homosexuality and and gay people and love them well. And then the AIDS crisis comes and there's this great cry from a lot of gay Christians who were in the closet that they are afraid to die of AIDS and they want help some kind of help. And the best solution that Christians as they would around quickly to try to find something to help these these gay Christians was unfortunately prey to gay way therapy, and that's a very important thing. And I think that we learned later, because a lot of harm, it over promised and it doubled people's risk of suicide album. So I think that started to create some divisions and pretty serious pain. And then when I think the gay marriage issue was used particularly as a wedge political issue in the 2000s, particularly in politics in the US, but probably true for a season in the UK as well. That supercharged this conversation. And in the US today, particularly around trans issues, continuing to be used as a wedge issue and supercharging the division around that. So I think that's why there's a cultural division kind of why maybe are there differences theologically, you know, I do think that God through the scripture is understood by the church read with the church. Has a certain perspective on sexual ethics and what's best for all of our sexual stewardship, but I think much more of the division we perceive has to do with those cultural and political elements over the past decades and it has to do with what's in the scriptures. So and I think the way we can see that is before all these political and cultural elements in the kind of 50s, 60s, 40s. We have John Stott, John Stott, Francis Schaefer and Franklin Billy Graham speaking really with with nuance and love into this topic. And we are on a good trajectory as a church to recognize the gay people exist, the gay people can't become straight and they need to find a way to belong in our churches. We need to offer space for a belonging in our churches. Good trajectory. So so the Bible and even kind of some of those parts of the church weren't the issue, the problem was how it just got culturally and politically supercharged in my opinion. Are you are you currently a therapist, Peter. Yeah, so I'm a licensed professional counselor and I do that about a half day a week like to be honest, God should be with the patience to be a therapist full time. But yeah, and I primarily meet with clients who are gay and Christian and navigating questions of faith and sexuality. Okay, have you seen therapy change in recent years for the LGBT community? I would say, you know, two decades ago it would be really hard to find a therapist that would offer you anything other than conversion therapy and pray the gay way therapy. And today, thankfully, that's changed significantly. And some of us maybe flipped on its head today. It's hard to find a therapist who isn't pushing you toward a kind of progressive sexual ethic in the counseling space. But it is still possible to find a therapist who say, you know, hey, pray the gay way therapy doesn't work. I can't offer you that. But hey, if you client wants to steward your sexuality according to a traditional sexual ethic, I can support you in evidence-based with evidence-based practices in trying to pursue that goal. But it's sometimes it's harder to find a counselor, at least here in the States that they can offer that. Okay, how important is trauma therapy and what you do? Super important. And so this comes up in my work as a therapist, but also in my work doing some consulting with churches. The number one barrier to my clients thriving long term, my clients who are gay and Christian and trying to stew it that according to a traditional sexual ethic are the lingering wounds of the classes. And that's a trauma experience. So on average, there's a five-year gap between when a teen first realized is they experienced same-sex attractions versus when they first tell a parent or pastor. And that is five years when they're alone, making sense of their sexuality, without the love and wisdom of their parents. And that often leads to anxiety, loneliness, depression, suicidality, unhealthy coping mechanisms, abandoning kind of the faith or loss of life. And so, and those things compound, year after year after year and after five years of that, five years of hiding, five years of believing shame messages. And that's of the hearts people for the rest of their life. Okay. We have a comment from Jenny here's a previous guest in the show. And I'll probably say the gay, a waste of his so toxic. So please they are. There are people like Peter in the space. Yeah, I've never heard of that to be honest. It sounds very American to me, but it's probably a very smart I guess. Maybe Peter, maybe for you, Kate, guess, because there is a difference between American evangelical Christianity and kind of what the British understand even in evangelical Christianity. Can you explain what pray the gay away is or was. Yeah, and if you're interested in kind of watching a cinematic portrayal of this, if you can get on kind of a US kind of Netflix account and watch boy erased is a as a movie adaptation of a book about kind of those kind of experiences in the US. It's pretty typical. It's very powerful, very moving. But basically, kind of as the AIDS crisis where this was unfolding, there were some kind of more charismatic spaces in Christianity in the US that thought that through some mix of kind of 40 in psychology and kind of charismatic Christian practices that one could pray the gay away that one could remove someone same sex attractions grow their opposite sex attractions, turn a gay person into a straight person. And there were a lot of incentives for people to self report that they were experiencing. Chains that maybe they weren't experiencing as robustly, there was a lot of pressure on leaders in these organizations to continue to say that they weren't experiencing same sex attractions anymore that they weren't gay anymore, even if they were feeling those things in private. And as you can imagine, that was just a closet of another kind and led to lots of painful experiences and the studies show that, you know, 96% of people who pursued those sexual orientation change efforts, which is the kind of clinical term. We're unsuccessful in experiencing any change in their sexual orientation, probably unsurprising to most of the audience. And that three to four percent that did experience maybe some change probably has more to do with kind of just our natural sexual fluidity and flexibility than it has to do with kind of a miraculous orientation change. But those same same study showed that participation and those sexual orientation change efforts doubled participants risks of suicide. That's probably also not intuitively, you know, surprising to our audience, but there's data to back that up. So yeah, if ever a counseling client or password comes to me and is kind of toying with this possibility of of seeking or providing any kind of sexual orientation change efforts, a very strongly show them the the scientific studies and say this is not the way. Yeah. All right, well, we've got a load of comments about this. Got the question. So in its, uh, E. We're is I think in the UK, it's not called the same and James, you seem to be sitting right now on a page from the corner. Despite being in the same room with Chris Eris, saying yes, some of the Holy Spirit demon possession writing was on 100 sectionity during the sign of demon possession in the 1979 1990s. Anyway, before we get why laid on for either way, so it's a time to be let's talk about this modern monastery thing. Okay, yeah, because that's kind of interesting. So like we've all got an idea it's been a long time and well certainly in the UK because we can really I've got rid of all the monasteries in the 16th century here so we're not quite. And not something you just has ever had any monasteries. So not many. Describe what you're already the old monasteries was and then say what your new modern monastery is and why you kind of go into it and do you live in the modern monasteries? Yeah, so the answer to the last question is yes. So the image that probably comes with people's mind is is yeah something from a movie with kind of a group of probably more. Rotund guys with shaved heads with just a ring of hair right here. Yeah, who are in black robes and and are eating drinking lots of beer and maybe praying with some people or hiding in a cave or secluded in a desert or some of these kinds of like tropes. And that's not that's not really the most common form of monasticism historically, but it's certainly the most cinematic portrayal of monasticism. Yeah, I mean long story short I, you know, I became convinced that what God was calling me to was the kind of singleness for the sake of kingdom work that's described in Matthew 19 and first Corinthians seven in the scripture is by by Jesus and Paul. But I didn't feel like I had some like magical gift of celibacy to where I didn't need any kind of human family anymore and like all I needed to go was going to my prayer closet and then Jesus would meet all my intimacy needs that was not me that's some people that's not me. So I went to my priest. I'm an angelic in so I went to my angelic in priest and I asked him how am I going to find family in the church among Christians. And I'm really was blessed by his answer he was really honest and he said, I don't think you're going to find the kind of family you need in this church or any other church in the city that we're in anytime soon. We just don't do this well yet. But he said, monasticism has been the most common way to sell the people have found family. Monasticism has been the greatest source of evangelism in the church historically. Monasticism has been the greatest source of theology in the church historically. Monasticism has been the greatest source of social justice in the church historically. So he said, I think you should start a kind of modern monastery in Nashville and find the family build the family that you need among believers. Stay connected to our church keep going to our church and teach our church how to do this better so that's essentially what we started doing five years ago so we're called the Nashville family of brothers. We live in a house together and we do you know we do family life together we pray together in the mornings and we do meals together and we do holidays and vacations together. And we live under kind of a common rule of life which you know isn't too different than your typical family. Every family has house rules some of them are unspoken some of them are more formal we just had to make it more formal because there's you know more than two adults in our house. And but yeah we really see ourselves as a family like eventually guys we make increasing kind of commitments to our community and our hope is eventually the guys would make lifetime commitments to this family. And but we're still a part of our local churches like we don't we don't you know our our home is not our church. We still have jobs outside of our house right so we're not all like in the house making beer and praying all day long or something or making making cheese making bread that sounds great but that's not what we're doing. But we do believe that like as people call it a vocational singleness is how we would describe it. That we're supposed to leverage our nine to five job for the sake of the kingdom so we do think like like because we don't have to worry about kind of the energy and costs associated with having us fast and kids. And we should maybe use our nine to five job in ways that are are optimized for bringing forth the kingdom bringing healing to our communities more quickly. And ways that maybe you don't get paid as well or maybe ways that are a little bit more stress. You know, so yeah that's what that's what we do. Peter this sounds like something that would that many people be interested in do you have off shoots or some kind of branches and other cities. Yeah, so we've talked to a couple of of of of people and other cities are interested in starting something similar and that's really my hope is to for this to be the for people to take this model and and tweak it and apply it in their context and for then it would be more intentional Christian community in lots of cities. You know, we're a house of just guys, but we've been praying that there would be a similar house of women in our city. But but in other contexts, maybe people would like to do a kind of a co-ad housing or a mix between single and married people. So there's lots of different ways to do this, but I think we need intentional Christian community. I think a lot of believers find themselves lonely when they just live in this kind of single family home with multiple doors and miles and just connecting them from other people and their church and other believers. How many people in your don't monastery in Nashville. Yes, it's cozy right now. There are six of us in a kind of three three and two thirds bedroom house. Okay, but this fall we're going to have three or four more guys move into our community and we're going to be moving out of this this house we're currently into kind of a larger space so that guys can kind of have their own room with if they want their own room. So so yeah, it's small right now. But it's building. Yeah, do you do interviews give a waiting list how do you choose who gets to be in your home. Yeah, so we have a 12 month process that guys explore from outside of the house. Whether or not they're a good fit to move into the house and it's both them figuring out if our community is a good fit for them. And us figuring out whether they're a good fit for us and so they're in that 12 month process they they kind of re-fuel our house rules essentially. They get to know guys in the house they get to know each other they meet with a pastor or a spiritual director to kind of think about these questions. And they make some kind of visits to to our house to kind of for trial some trial periods you know so yeah. So. Yeah, so I'm talking to the Christian. I'm sorry about that, but um. Is it like you save vocational singleness. Does somebody have to be chased by well chased in your place or is it that they just have to be single and not in their relationship with somebody. I mean, obviously this comes down to the whole sexuality thing. Sure. If somebody in your your monastery started going out with somebody right by you kicked out I mean how how how does that relationship part work. Yeah, so part of our kind of house rules and part of the commitments that guys make before moving in and as they kind of make longer commitments to being a part of this community. It is a commitment to the kind of abstinence singleness described in Matthew 19 and first Corinthians seven which just by the text alone. It's it's it's it's mostly clear that what they're talking about is a permanent giving up of dating romance marriage sex. For the sake of using the time and energy you would use for some of those things and raising kids to do other kingdom work that parents have a hard time finding that the inner struggle to find the time. And that's also consistently been the the the understanding of those scriptures of the church that's how the time churches top of those with those scriptures mean so so you have to just you know sell a bit singleness. That we're doing. And yeah, I mean, but that doesn't mean we're a bunch of kind of lonely touch star of people. There's a lot of rich emotional intimacy in our house. There's a lot of her spiritual intimacy and intellectual intimacy and there's a lot of there's a lot of hugs and there's a lot of like you know offering. You know care in the form of healthy physical intimacy to each other so. You know as as I get a slightly older and as I'm doing life with some of my married friends who have kids. I'm increasingly realizing that what I'm finding in this family of brothers in terms of meeting my intimacy needs and healthy ways is not really that different. Yeah, then what my married friends who have been married for a decade and have a couple of kids what their intimacy looks like so. James James did a comment said a comment and it says there's a small bit growing new. I'm going to ask this isn't there you go movements in the UK and I read with how and I agreed with how that place the catalyst for the a lot the legit of my word James you and your big. And James. And James moves be as one such organizer in the UK. You probably want to discover his giant from James we're getting too much in domesticism. Yeah, I thought you get my. I've always because I still on the. I find that fascinating because James does have an Anglican background so you know this is this is interesting on on both sides of the pond. Yeah, yeah. Are you training other houses Peter to do be like yours. Yes, so we're doing a little kind of informal kind of coaching mentoring some houses and other cities are interested in starting something similar. But our hope is that you know we're still young in this like five years old is not that old so we're hoping the next five years 10 years. We really can like discover the secret sauce for this and then we can share that. With other communities who want to make something similar and really share with them in confidence. We've tried lots of different things here's what's worked for us here's what we would recommend. Peter you've written some things where can people find some of your writings. Yeah, so the easiest place would be to go to. Peter L. Volk calm so it's a Dutch spelling so P. I. E. T. E. R. L. V. As in Victor. L. K. dot com. And there's there's a publications tab there where you can check out some of the things I've written. One of the things I'm really proud of is I got for an article for Christianity today about this vocational singleness. What is it? Where is it in scripture? How can our church to do this better? And particularly how could we discern? How could we invite Christian young adults to really seriously consider both vocational Singleness and Christian marriage as a possibility for themselves. So if you also Google Christianity today Peter Volk or vocational singleness Christianity today. That article will come up. And then if any of you guys are on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram and that's where it kind of you you like to engage with content. You can find me on any of those platforms. The same handle a Peter L. Volk so P. I. E. T. E. R. L. V. A. OK. So yeah, would love to continue conversation. Would love if you ought to see more of kind of the lots of video content out there there's there's publications and different. Through different kind of online kind of journals and and magazines and there's some sort of personal reflections as well about my story. I mean, I'm guess I'm bearing the lead here, but I mean, a reason why I care about all these things is that I'm gay. And I'm a Christian and I'm committed to a traditional sexual ethic and I believe the way God is inviting me to steward that is vocational single listen so a lot of don't be surprised that I go to my conscience. And I'm going to talk about that part of my story too. So this message is so important for even geological church here in America today and I want to ask one final question before Tim takes it away from me. Sure. What is your primary message to the American evangelical church for the L. K. B. T. Q. I. A. Community. So I think for kind of particularly conservative evangelicals in the US for a long time they hope that. And and I think with compassion they hope this that that that pray the gay way would fix their gay problem. They would just turn their gay people straight and then that's that's what would that's what would kind of help that would that's what would attend to the challenges the pain the gay people who are Christians were saying they were experiencing. That I think we need to accept that that is not the solution that they're going to be people in our church in our evangelical churches who have enduring same sex attractions who love Jesus and want to find a way to follow his teachings and ways that brings goodness and beauty to their life. And I would ask that conservative kind of evangelical Christian is. How is that kind of person going to find goodness and beauty in your church. Do you have any concept for that you know and I think the first step is accepting the fact that people are going to have enduring same sex attractions and so just getting them opposite sex married and and putting them in that pipeline is not a solution. I think the key solution is actually taking seriously what Jesus and Paul had to say in scripture about singleness for the sake of the kingdom. And our conservative evangelical churches being places that not only teach what's actually inscripture about it, but take practical steps to embody it to actually become churches where where we instead of seeing singleness and sell it single as a liability for church leadership we see it as an asset. And so I'm realizing romance and kids. We yes value marriage and kids, but we also value a celibacy and doing other kinds of kingdom work. I think we've got to take seriously our churches being places that cultivate intentional Christian community. We're so little that people can find family, but also that's going to help out the married people in our churches. I mean, I I'm connecting to a lot of people who go to conservative evangelical churches who are married and they feel lonely. They're looking for richer experience of community. So I can go on and on and on, but that's what I would have to say to kind of conservative evangelical Christians and the US. Okay, well, Christian basically answer question I was going to ask. Okay, well, less in a different way. I was going to say what does you want to change about the US just. Yeah, I'm going to ask you a totally off the question of ask a few people, but if you have to describe yourself using three animals what three animals would you pick. Oh, okay. So there was definitely a phase when I was in college that you know people were. I'm sure this goes happens in waves, you know, every couple of every couple of decades, but wherever it was trying to like identify what their spirit animal was. Okay, so I at the time, well, always went back and forth between a fox and a and a mongous. Yeah, so yeah, we're about a third animal. Even a fox in the mongous is a bit of a non combination. Or it had that one, yeah, I don't think too. Gosh, what would I mean, I think I have some I can have some squirrel tendencies sometimes. I'm pretty high energy. So, you know, so also I'll say fox mongous squirrel. Yeah, I did have a more controversial question. I'll come out. I don't think I will because I don't know, I can't get to a few. That's fair. That's fair. Are people able to hire you as a therapist outside of Nashville? Are you only practicing in Nashville? Like can people go on zoom and hire you? How does this work? Yeah, so so I meet with clients pretty exclusively virtually starting at the beginning of the pandemic and then I just continue that practice because most of my clients. All I think almost all of my clients right now are outside of the state of Tennessee. So yeah, if you're in the US, I can offer you license professional counseling virtually anywhere in the US. And then if you're outside of the US and you want to have some conversations about this, I cannot practice, you know, professional counseling as kind of licensed and understood. In the state of Tennessee in the US outside of this country. But I can offer kind of something more like life coaching or psychotherapy. That made sound like kind of technical legal language, but I just need to make clear that I can't provide professional counseling outside of the US. But yeah, people that that website, I offered earlier, Peter L. Volk.com. You can also learn more about my counseling services. You can learn about kind of, I speak at conferences, at churches, for campus ministries and different Christian spaces. And so you can get a sense of the kind of topics I speak on and there's even some video samples there. There's some of my personal testimony on the kind of the about page of that website. So there's a lot there, you know, if you heard something that I said today and it irritated you or made you curious or you found a light in it, you can find more of the same on my website. Okay, well it was great to have you on the show today. I think we've just about done. Thanks for all the people who commented. Thanks to Kristel for being here. Thanks to Peter for being here. And I'm going to play the outro now and I'll be in the crowd. Thank you, Peter. This is a terrible thing. I've made it. I've made it. Mobile money in the lottery. Yes, and I did it in the previous and I've spent anything.
