 I am a believer and I'm convinced of a historic sexual ethic and I'm gay. I'm same sex attracted and that's part of my story. So yeah, getting into that and how that all kind of started, I grew up hearing that gay people were gross and that they hated God and most of the conversation about gay people was, you know, contentious political debate about gay marriage. So it was just pretty clear that like, gay people are dirty gross and disgusting or at least that's what was communicated to me. What's up everybody? Welcome back to the things you don't hear in Turkish podcast. My name is Ethan. And my name is Daria and guys, if you haven't already done it, check it out on social media, especially if you're awesome. If you would leave us there a new one, Spotify, or anywhere else you'll see on the podcast. They're be amazing. We also have YouTube, we are on Instagram, pretty active on there. We're gonna take a talk anywhere else you apply. I want to find this for most likely there. We don't have a link in them. So, but, every else you apply, find us, we love to interact, we love to hear questions. That's good. Yes, so today's guest, we're really excited to have on. He's an author, speaker, church consultant, monastery builder, and a licensed counselor. He's the founder and executive director of this ministry called Equip. And that's the premier consulting training solutions for churches, aspiring to be places where gay people can thrive according to historic, sexual ethic, and they've trained over 20,000 church leaders awesome. He's been on shows, like theology in the raw, and with present sprinkles, and a number of others. So, Peter, welcome to the show, and thanks for coming up. Thanks for having me. Is there anything that we missed in that that you would like to go over? Yeah, or any like, I don't know, books or other series or articles you're written that you want to plug in the beginning? Well, I've had the privilege of writing for a variety of publications, and I'm sure we'll get to some links later for follow-up resources, but the easiest way to people, for people to find some of the things I've written in other podcasts is to go to PeterLVull.com. But my first name spelled funny, so I'm sure we'll put the link in the show. Yes, so it'll be in there. Peter with an eye, the be. So I gotta ask you, monastery builder, what is that even look like? Because we come from a process of background, and I've always had this dream, or I thought that in order to be a monk, you had to not be married, and I just got married. So now I was always like, well, both of them. When I wasn't married, I had this dream that I wish some, some part of me, some deep in my soul, wish I could retire to the mountains, and just eat a little simple life and study the scriptures. But I'm too caught up in the modern society, I had cities and technology. Fair enough, fair enough. But it's always been very interesting to me, like the monastic life, or what I think the monastic life is. So what does that even look like? And what does that mean? Yeah, so in the middle ages, a particular kind of kind of cloistered, ascetic monasticism took over in the church, and was the predominant for people doing monasticism or who call themselves monks. But before that, and kind of in the early church, and the apostles disciples, and their disciples and their disciples, the most common form of Christians doing celibacy was kind of a word called the Rhinnewoth, or like city monks. And they lived in the city. They were a part of their local churches. They were a part of the economy of the city. They were, they lived in kind of homes with other single people, but right next door to married people with their kids, they go to their church, and they were absent and committed to lifetime abstinence, singleness for the sake of the kingdom. And they believed they were supposed to be using their availability from not raising kids to do kingdom work that parents can't. And to serve their church and serve their community. So that early church form of celibacy, early church form of monasticism, I would argue a more biblical form of celibacy and monasticism. That's what we're trying to retrieve in the intentional Christian community that I live in, which is called the Nashville family of brothers. And it's a lot of your story of how that got started, but long story short, myself and some other guys, knew we were called to lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom. We also knew that we had not been given some magical gift of celibacy where we didn't need human companionship anymore. And so we asked our pastors, how are we gonna find the family in the body of Christ that we need? And they were really honest that they didn't think that our local churches were gonna be able to offer the kind of family we truly needed anytime soon. But that historically, monasticism has been the most common way that celibate people have found family. It's been the greatest source of theology in the church. It's been the greatest source of just the social justice in the church. It's been the greatest source of evangelism in the church. So it came highly recommended from them. And so we've been trying to kind of find a modern, urban way to do, to do monasticism where we're still a part of our local churches, still a part of biological family, still a part of friends outside of our community, but also have a robust sense of family in our intentional Christian community that most importantly, you know, sends us back to the Lord and spurs us on in our sanctification. Wow, is this the only kind of group that exists like this or are there different chapters of it? So we are the only chapter of the family of brothers, although we're talking with some guys and other cities about starting families of brothers there and families of sisters and other cities. But when we first started doing this, we found a brotherhood up in Michigan who is doing something different in some ways, similar in a lot of ways. And they've been able to provide us with a lot of advice. But also a lot of it has just been going back to the, descriptions of the early church and how they did this and saying, maybe they had the secret sauce. What if we just, okay, you know? Yeah. So that's what we've been doing. What were we going to do? Um, they're spread throughout some of the different major cities. So it's a brotherhood called Servants of the Word. And they are, uh, economically Christian as is our, our community. Um, although a majority of the guys in their communities are charismatic Catholic. Oh, no, no, no, no. Interesting. You don't meet many of those. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a place. Yeah, we, um, I'm not sure the order of the, of the episodes coming out right now, but last week we interviewed, uh, one of our friends and I'm taking Medina and he's, um, TikTok really influential and he's Catholic. Yeah. And so we had like a almost to our conversation about the Pope and then like afterwards, I was thinking I was like, wait, what did, what did Catholics believe about the gifts of the spirit? Because we're, we're both charismatic. And so, and we, our in ministry, we like run schools and so yeah. We have the lot of this conversation about the gifts and so I was like, wait, I've never heard of Catholic talk about that, but that's interesting that there's charismatic, kind of something. Yeah, okay. I know really fast, this is what we're like, messed up talking about, but, um, I'd love to know because I know you talk about this a lot. Do you know what it's, like, you know what it's like? But, uh, how does somebody know that they're called to singleness for their whole life in your opinion? Because you always have the classic like, a girl, like, breaks up with the guy and then all of a sudden like you're in this place and like, am I called the singleness forever? You're like, hurling and stuff like that and then you're just, you start considering it. And so, and you're just like, what's the young Christian without a girlfriend? I mean, young Christian guy without a girlfriend's like, I'm just in a season of singleness. Right. Yeah. Well, I think, so I think the reverse question is just as pertinent and reveals something about how we think about marriage and singles. And by that, I mean, how does someone know that they're called to make a lifetime commitment of Christian marriage to someone? You know, that's, I, my experience with Christian married people is it is just as hard as cello deceit. And in, in ruin, just as often. It's, just as desperately need the Lord to do it well and just as often people get into it not being serious enough about it and it ends up being the greatest source of pain in their life. So I think people should be as afraid of marriage as they are afraid of life. I'm single. Very interesting. Very initial approach. Oh, with, with Austin with fear and saying, Lord, do you have a preference of which gift you want to give me? You know, when we read Matthew 19 and 1st Corinthians 7, both Jesus and Paul seem to suggest that there's a gift. There's a particular grace as a particular portion of support that God gives for kingdom, singleness and for Christian marriage and that God doesn't give both to all of us. And that God is the giver of that gift. And that God seems to have a preference of which gift he gives. And so, you know, historically at least Christians recognize that that wasn't open handed question for everyone and then we'd probably be wiseist if we asked the Lord which gift do you want to give me? Regardless of what my preference is. And then God would you can form my heart to your preference. And I'll step down that path. So my, I think it would be, I think something amazing would happen in the church if every Christian young adult recognized their preference, set it aside and then open handedly ask the Lord, which gift do you want to give me? And then pursued whichever gift the God wanted to give. Now, how does any Christian kind of discern like that? As a variety of traditions of Christian discernment, I think Ignatian discernment in the Catholic tradition is kind of one of the most filled out. Traditions of kind of Christian discernment most kind of a concrete and kind of studied and practiced. But there's lots of ways that Christians discern that Christians intentionally ask the Lord questions. So, you know, however, one does that in their tradition apply that to the question of Christian marriage or vocational sequence. Awesome. I know what you taught about that for a long time. I'd love to. Sorry. Yeah. Maybe maybe at a future time. But today, we originally wanted to have you on because we read one of your articles in fact, the magazine among being in Christian, but being in the closet. And what it was like for the process of coming out of that, as well as some other things that were in there. And so we wanted to have you on to talk about that specifically. So if I could just ask straight up, when you were younger, when you were still in the closet, what was it like to be a Christian and to be in that space? I know your faith is probably evolved since then, but for where were then I was at like. Yeah. And the backstory for those listening is I am a believer. And I'm convinced of a historic sexual ethic. And I'm gay. I'm same sex attracted. And that's part of my story. So yeah, getting into that and how that all kind of started, I grew up hearing that gay people were gross and that they hated God. And most of the conversation about gay people was contentious political debate about gay marriage. So it was just pretty clear that gay people are dirty gross and disgusting, or at least that's what was communicated to me. And in the few times that came up in church, it was just a simple statement. God is against homosexuality. So when I started noticing that I was attracted to other guys when I was going through puberty, at first I just ignored it. And then I vowed that no one would know. And I'd proverbially proverbally went into the closet, which is a phrase that people use to describe when sexual and gender minorities recognize that they are different in that way. They hide from others about that part of their story. They walk into a psychological closet and lock the door and lock themselves inside. Because they're afraid of people new about their story that they would be hurt, that they would be rejected. And that was my fear. I was afraid that if people knew me, that they would no longer love me, that they would find me dirty, gross and disgusting, that if I were fully known, I would not be fully loved. So it's best just to hide. So that's what I did. And not merely by not telling people, but I was obsessed about covering my tracks. I was obsessed with making sure no one would pick up on even a hint that same sex attraction was my story. I analyzed how I spoke. And if I sounded to feminine, I analyzed how I walked, I analyzed the gestures I made. I rehearsed mental scripts of how I would like join in with my straight guy friends to talk about an objectify female class. Like, because it didn't come naturally to me. I didn't find these women attractive. So I had to listen to how other guys talk to objectify other women and then like care at those back to them. I forced myself to date girls, even though I wasn't really interested in any of them. You know, I pre-purety, I had like back to back lead roles in school plays in our middle school. And then when I got to high school, and I realized everyone who was in the theater club was also in the gay straight alliance, I quit the interview. Because I was terrified. If I was associated with those people, people would think I was gay. And I remember like super vehemently arguing against the legalization of gay marriage. When I was in high school, that was back in the States in 2007, 2008, when those things were being debated most. I'm hoping no one would suspect that the super Jesusy guy who played soccer and dated girls and spoke critically of gay people in gay marriage, he could possibly be gay himself. So a lot of work, a lot of effort to try to hide from other people. And make sure that they didn't think this was a part of my story. And then in the meantime, while I was in the closet, when I was in there alone, I was busy trying to make myself straight. I prayed thousands of prayers that God would eliminate my same sex attractions. I would do hundreds of hours of counseling with therapists who said they could reduce my same sex attractions and increase my office of sex attractions. I interned for after college, I interned for a pray to gayway ministry for nine months, hoping that that might change something about my story. Is that what it was called? Or is that the type of a pray the gayway ministry? Okay. It says the ministry doesn't exist anymore. Yeah, the ministry doesn't exist anymore for the right reasons. But yeah, nothing changed about my sexual orientation. But I did, you know, from that decade in the closet or those of trying to make myself straight, I gained a lot of self-hate and a lot of shame and a lot of loneliness and a lot of anxiety. Mind you, I like I continued to be committed to a historic sexual ethic. I continued to follow Jesus and yearn to follow his teachings. I, you know, I wasn't contemplating running off into the sunset with some guy. But I was worried that even if I just shared that I was same-sex attracted but not acting on it, that people would still love me less and treat me less and find me disgusting. So, because I knew other people who that was their story and that's how people responded. Yeah. So, what was the thing that helped you continue to be a Christian through all that? Because I know a lot of people have experienced that and it gets so hard and the tension there and trying to balance it. That ultimately they might run the risk of de-converting and deconstructing and just trying to like, yeah, figure it on their own. Like, what was the thing that anchored you to a Christian beat? Yeah, so, um, I don't want to over simplify too much, but, um, I mean, I grew up with a mix of different ideas about God and Jesus. And plenty of hearing about Jesus' love for me and Jesus' compassion and God's love for the world. And that's why he sent his son and was willing to die on the cross for our sins. But I also heard plenty of, he is the God of the universe. And I, by default, deserve hell. And God doesn't, God doesn't owe me heaven. Mm-hmm. And, um, so it's really important that I actually follow Jesus. And it's really important that even if I don't feel it, I choose to believe that a God exists and that's the God of the Bible. And I choose to follow His wisdom and I choose to take my salvation seriously because it has eternal consequences. Like, this isn't, uh, it doesn't matter if I think God is cringe. He's still the God of the universe. You know what I'm saying? He doesn't care. If I think He's cringe and I just decided to cancel Him, then I, then I, then I go to hell. You know, like, it, yeah, we're not sure if we're not sure if we're not sure if we're not sure God and the letting me in to heaven. Yeah. It's so, I just had a sense of like, it doesn't matter. Matter whether I think this is fair. If He's the God of the universe, He makes the rules. Yeah. Did you, and did you explore? Did you explore other avenues of, like, thought patterns and maybe religions or ways of life that, and then came back and I was like, nah, that's some convinced Christianity's true. Um, I'd say in college, I, um, is when I kind of got exposed to alternate interpretations of scripture and engaged with those, but I never found them, just find, find nature. I'm kind of, you know, I'm a, I'm a heavy tea on the Myers Briggs. Um, I, like, think a lot before I feel or like I recognize that anyway, that's all to say that, uh, while there was a lot of emotional appeal to many of the arguments for revisionist sexual ethic, I knew that for me to kind of have respect for myself and for me to like adopt a revisionist sexual ethic and like hold on to it with integrity, I need to actually be convinced that it was more true. And I need to actually engage with the arguments in a robust and intellectually honest way. And when I put myself to do that, they, they always fell apart. You know, to my dissatisfaction, right? Like I wanted a revisionist sexual ethic to be more satisfying, to be more true. And I just like fell apart in my hand every time I tried to examine it. Um, uh, now I made plenty of mistakes. I failed to live up to my commitments of a historic sexual ethic plenty of times, you know, but I, um, but I was rarely, but I, I really doubted whether it was true. Um, and even in the times when I, I send and I didn't live up to my commitment to a historic sexual ethic, that, that send usually only further affirmed that, you know, that following a revisionist sexual ethic wasn't going to make me happier. Um, you know, like often what would tempt me to, to send was some version of the enemy whispering in my ear, you know, you're unhappy. It's because you don't have love with a man in a sexual and romantic way. If you just went and got that, you would be happy. So then I would go and get that and it, when you're, you know, and make me happier for four hours, but I wanted to be happier for the next week. Uh, so yeah. Yeah. What was it like emotionally being in that place of being in the closet and not wanting people to hate you for who you like, how you feel and who you are? What is that? What is that like emotionally for you to be in that space? I don't know how long you were in the closet before before you came out. You began to ask that question as well. Yeah. So I'd say first recognize my same sex attractions in sixth grade. I've told my parent, I've told another person for the first time in 11th grade. Um, and but I didn't start coming out to a wider group of people until sophomore year of college. Um, so yeah, that's good. Um, what was that like, you know, I think and my background is a graduate level training is in clinical mental health counseling and I'm a licensed professional counselor. So it's not, you know, what's pretty typical is, um, the way you survive it is you try to ignore it as much as possible. You try to shove it in a back corner and think about it as little as possible. But what that means is that you have to kind of disconnect from your feelings as well so that you keep some distance from all of your feelings. So there's a general numbness to life or a general kind of seeking of things that can help you numb your feelings, accomplishments, um, video games, food, alcohol, drugs, uh, you know, anonymous sex, all these things people will uh sleep, you know, whatever it is, um, schoolwork, you know, getting the good grades, getting to the best schools, you know, use these things to distract themselves from their own feelings and from the parts of my story that I did I wanted to avoid. So that's certainly what I did, you know, I was I, for me, then my primary kind of drugs, so to speak to avoid the pain of the closet was just to be obsessed with schoolwork and, and obsessed with accomplishments and obsessed with getting into the best school and getting the best scholarships and doing all those things. Um, and then like many people who are in the closet, you know, uh, uh, developed and, you know, really unhealthy habits with pornography and masturbation, um, and we clearly that's not because gay people are any more likely to be sex addicts than than straight people inherently, um, but I think the closet is the perfect Petri dish for sexual bro, for sexual addiction, unfortunately, um, because that that's, well, that's the one place you can, it's fall into the scene with that, but, but some part of your mind thinks well, at least there's this one place where I can connect with the kind of intimacy that I want, right? And it's kind of a pressure release valve or at least it, it, it, it claims to be that, you know, some part of our brain tells us it will be a pressure release valve. This, this will help me get through another week, right, another month, right, so, wow, was there anybody along the way of that journey? Um, they were talking about, you came out to a few people you said, I ever once in a while, but was there anybody along that journey that might have made you think like, oh, maybe like, I would be accepted if I did, and they're like, no, no, no, I need to like reject this. Was there anybody along the way that made you feel like that? Or no? Yeah, so, uh, you know, I thought, I was, say a tough experience was when I first told my parents they, they didn't know how to help me any more than I knew how to help myself. Yeah. And so, you know, that the only solution they thought of and when they asked around some friends was they took me to a therapist who, uh, you know, we, we spent the, the hour talking about strategies to kind of block out, gay thoughts in my mind, and then I got into the car with one of my parents after that session, the parent asked me, so is it fixed? And I said, yes, wow. And then we never talked about it again for five years. Whoa. Uh, and, and similarly, like a year or two later, I, you know, on one of these, like youth group, we can retreat after a, like Saturday night devotional. There was really emotional and the person who gave the diva was encouraging everyone to share with an adult leader about the things they felt the most shame about so they could have freed him from that burden. Um, you know, I then went and like talked to, you know, the youth pastor about my story and he was just like silent and then like offered a couple of like Christian cliches and then basically sent me away. So I think at least from those two experiences, my biggest takeaway wasn't that people would be like overtly harmful, but that they would be clueless that and that I would have to end up taking care of them. Wow. Wow. Because they wouldn't know how to handle it. And so it's maybe just best for me to make sense to this by myself. I'm more of an expert than any of them are going to be anyway. I should make sense of this by myself. Yeah, but certainly other people's stories have been, you know, have been overt, you know, painful reactions people. Yeah. Yeah. So now like being years removed from that situation and the going through the counseling bed, you know, didn't work in the end of that one minute, sure they got shut down now. Um, I feel like growing up, it's kind of the same thing that when we experienced was like the idea, the narrative was like, yeah, pray the gay away or whatever, like no one's born gay, but now science has come out and kind of said the opposite of that, how do Christians kind of like understand that in a theological manner of like, well, if it's true that people are born gay, then why, why got why are they like that, you know, and one thing that like and it's in the other thing like you can't just like, you said you're they said, hey, it's a fix and you said, yeah, like the thing about that is like, well, you can't help me or track it to and like, I remember I heard, I gave her to say that like, Ethan start liking men or something like that and I was like, oh, how it is for you? Like, yeah, that's impossible. Like, I just, it's not something that you consciously are just deciding to do. You know, it's just a natural thing that happens. And so how do Christians understand that in a theological manner? Does that mean sense? Right. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, so the classic kind of forced choice of born gay or choose to be gay. You know, so I think he actually the most scientifically accurate answer is neither. We neither choose who were attracted to nor are we born, biologically or genetically determined to develop our sexual orientations. And I mean, actually, if you can consult, if you kind of the most rigorous, you know, LGBT plus scientists, progressive, secular scientists, they would say, yeah, anyone who claims that people are born gay just haven't looked at the science. The science is pretty clear that there is a, some kind of genetic predisposition. So, there is a meaningful genetic factor, but it's not the majority factor. Interesting. We don't know what the other factors are. But the only other factors could be something in environmental, something nurture based. And so, so, you know, the science seems to show that the primary, the majority contributor to developing our sexual orientations is environmental, is nurture is what we grow up. So, so we are neither born gay nor do we choose to be gay. But, you know, people, I think people say, well, people don't choose their sexual orientations. And if when people ask God to change their sexual orientations, he doesn't, you know, well, that must mean that God intends for them to be as they are. Intends for them to have the sexual orientations that they do. And therefore, we'd only, you know, a kind God must allow them to seek monogamous loving relationships with the people that he gives them desires for. So, I think the problem with that reasoning is none of us are how God made us to be. None of us are born how God intended us to be. All of us are, you know, God imagined us, you know, before time, like how we would be perfectly, if we were born into a perfect world. And then we are, are, are, are, are, are, we're formed in our mother's womb. Our genes are broken. Our genetics are broken. Then we form imperfectly in a physical way around those genetic instructions. We form imperfectly in our mother's womb. And then we are born into a broken world that injures us countless times before we ever gained agency to sin ourselves. And then we gain the agency to sin ourselves and then we muck it up even more. Not of us our God made us to be. All of us are messed up. So, so how we are today doesn't tell us anything about God's intentions. And I think if we, at least for believers, if we study, particularly Romans 1, you know, it talks about in Romans 1, not only does it, does it talk about the morality of same sexual behavior, but it talks about whether the desires for same sexual behavior are good, or whether those are God's intentions. And it makes pretty clear that they're not, that they're broken. And so, and God doesn't intend broken things for us. Okay, so then it seems clear God does not intend for anyone to experience same sexual attraction, but we develop it because of brokenness in our genetically and brokenness in the world around this. God allows that to happen. And then most of the time we ask God to change that, he chooses not to. What gives? How is that okay? Is Lisa a reasonable question that a lot of people go to next? That's really the classic question of like, why do bad things happen to seemingly innocent people? Right? That's a broader theological apologetics question, question of evil kind of thing, and different people from different traditions have different answers to that question. So, at least for me, what's comforting is a theology of, you know, a really robust theology of free will and particularly kind of free process. Yeah. The idea that in order for our choices to mean something, God has to allow God chooses to allow the consequences of our decisions to play out. Even if the consequences of those decisions are injury on us and injury on others around us. He chooses the greater good of allowing us to have real choice, even if that means he has to, you know, sometimes step away and allow things to fall apart. And so I think I developed this brokenness in my life, because of the the sin and the broken decisions of other people in multiple generations back and in the generation that I grew up in and was surrounded by. And God chose not to swoop in and protect me from the consequences of other people's decisions and and keep me from developing same-sex attractions because of the greater good of allowing other people and myself to have real choice. So, and you know, we see plenty of examples in scripture of people asking God to to heal them and make everything better and he does, you know, and all of us at friends, yeah, who have some broken about them that they've asked God to make right and and he hasn't. So, you know, gay people are not unique in that way. But I think, you know, I'll say what comforts me around all of that is that, you know, God says in his scriptures that he, he will work through all things for for his glory and for my good. And I see that to be true, like despite his brokenness, same-sex attractions enduring in my life, God is kind of using that enduring brokenness to break him glory and and to bring goodness to my life. I mean, it's submitting my sexuality to God and and following where he leads has been the greatest source of purpose and meaning and joy and and belonging and community in my life. So, it's definitely worth it, you know, for me. Wow, what a good philosophical, free-brish answer. I know a lot of that, like you said, is a lot of the answers of the problem of evil. The lot people take with just natural corruption, making sense of a lot of things, which like on top of the free-well asks, but of it, like you said, and we get, we, we answer a lot of the questions because we do a lot of apologetics, we do a lot of evangelism and if people just understood that, so many questions would be answered. Like I, it's also kind of funny that people don't make this realization themselves too, because so many people will be like, oh, like, this is just how I am, this is how God created me. I'm just, I have this, this thing, but I, it's just how I am, even if it's not positive. But then, like, they're like, I have the toxic trait he, he, I'm a Virgo, like, like, I can't get rid of it or something like that. Or I'm trying to get rid of it and like they pick and choose some things that are wrong with them, they're trying to change and some things that are wrong with them, are just like, how God made you and I just get so confused how people like choose, this is the thing that I'm going to say, God, maybe this way, but like, this is the thing that I'm going to try to change. It's interesting. So people understand that natural, right? Yeah, that's what's the next question. It's all so many issues for the Christian. Yeah, and I like that point a lot too, because when in evangelism when I've talked to people and specifically this one time I was in California on this high school, it's not hate it and they asked, like, hey, does God hate gay people? And I was like, nope, and I'm like so sorry that like society hasn't done a good job of showing you that. And the truth of the matter is like, if you're gay, you have an attraction to another individual and if it doesn't follow the biblical guidelines for what is okay, then you don't act on it. Just like, I am a straight guy, but like, I don't get to sleep with girls. I'm not married to because it doesn't follow the biblical mandate. And I was like, look, we both are dealing with a type of lust or attraction and we both have to respond to accordingly. So there's actually not that much difference other than who we're attracted to. And I do want to recognize that like, for gay people, it's a lot harder because they don't ever get to satisfy that longing, you know, like at least a straight person could get married to the opposite gender. But the thing about it, we're like, I, I notice a lot is that people will say, like, oh, because I'm gay, like, I have to act this out and I'm going to act this out and I'm going to maybe do some her medical gymnastics to make my whole say it's okay. But I also notice that people like, you're saying, oh, I'm just a Virgo Christians do this all the time for normal things too. Yeah. Like, even non-sexual things, like, well, I'm just like, people like, like, punching holes and walls and I'm just angry. I'm just angry person and I'm like, well, take out a man. The Bible says to put away all anger and balance. So you, you have to put that away. You don't get to stay there just because you have a bad temper. Just teaches, it just tells, I'm like, you just, you just don't read that part of the Bible, I guess. And it's not like, there's things that I probably have where I'm like that too. Yeah. And it's just funny where we, we do that, like, with any grim stuff, right? People would take the any grim then be like, hey, how can we didn't talk to that person who hurt you? And I like, well, I'm just a nine. So I'm not kind of foundational. Yeah. It doesn't matter. Like, so funny. Yeah. Wow. So moving on from from this point, what was it like for you to come out of that closet to finally come to a point where you would come out to people? And you maybe let us know how that happened. And if it was one person or just like post on social media, I don't know. Right. I mean, like, is everybody your one person? So can you share this that story? Was that like getting from a place where you are totally afraid to let people know, like, who you were to be okay with it? Yeah. It was, I mean, it was a mixed bag. So, you know, for example, I, you know, shared a lot with the campus ministry that I was a part of in, in undergrad and, you know, led, Bible studies and disciple people and led recruitment efforts and represented our organization to the university. And it was given, you know, every reason to believe that if I wanted to go on staff with this campus ministry after I graduated, that I could. And then, you know, by the end of my senior year, I was told out, I was a blue, you know, and no, not very little explanation that not to apply to go on staff at that campus or with that ministry at any campus. Wow. And the only explanation they gave was that they didn't know what to do with me and my same sex interactions. So, so some of the reactions that I got, you know, were, were really cruddy. Wow. But, you know, thankfully, I think there were stops and starts of kind of sharing my story with different kinds of groups and of people, smaller groups of people. But I would say the moment when it felt like, I don't know. I would say, what moment did I come out? What moment did I share with a critical mass of people that feel like something changed about whether or not it was in the closet or not? It was probably soft when you're a college when I was in a Christian fraternity. And there was a guy in our Christian fraternity who left our Christian fraternity because he was an unrepentant sexual relationship with another guy. And, but that caused a controversy because we were on a secular private university. And a lot of brothers kind of responded to that episode poorly. And so I just felt compelled that I needed to share my testimony with, you know, all 100 guys in our fraternity, Christian fraternity. So that guys who were straight would know how to kind of talk more compassionately and love people like me better. And if there were any other guys in the fraternity who had the same story and convictions as me, but they would know they weren't alone. So, you know, with with with much terror, I share with this group of 100 guys and to my delight, you know, they responded so positively. I mean, like what if or another so many guys lined up to give me a hug and pulled out their phone and you know, said, I want to like I want to get coffee, I want to hear more about your story. Like thank you so much for your courage. And then in like the six to eight months after that, about 10, 10 to 15 guys in the fraternity, we know, one of the times shared with me privately that that they had the same story and convictions that I did and often I was one of the first people that they had told. So I think both because of the overwhelmingly like loving and positive response of the straight guys in that fraternity. And then because it was kind of a sharing my story in that space, open the door to connect with others with a similar story and convictions. And then we were able to do life together and support each other in mostly healthy ways. Yeah, that was a really key moment for me. A really beautiful moment for me. Wow. Anyways, that was the beginning of all of the work I do today, you know, because doing life with you know, other 10 guys, we all realized kind of two things we had in common. We were all afraid that if we followed the Bible's teachings, we would be alone for a lifetime. And none of us had parents or pastors who knew what to do with us, who knew how to help us. So that was, you know, in many ways, that was the beginnings of in 2014, I started a quip to a quip parents and pastors with the understanding and skills to better love and serve people like me. Yeah. And then in 2018, I helped start the National Family of Brothers to offer family to men called to vocational, singleness, regardless of sexual orientation. Well, I know if we ever part of running a church will definitely hire you to help us. So, I have this question. I have a lot of friends who, yeah, I'll always share a similar experience as you. But this is the difference that I see in some of them. I'd love your thoughts on this. A lot of them will say, well, I am attracted to the same gender as myself, but I'm not going to identify as gay because I want them to be part of my identity, right? And whether or not they're trying to not be gaining more, they're still like, they're still accepted at whatever it is. They don't want to use that label. What do you think about that? Yeah, yeah, I think people should use kind of whatever language is most helpful for them and whatever is most, you know, conducive for, for their certification. So, you know, at least for me, the phrase seems sex attraction is pretty strongly associated. I mean, it was, it was popularized by the Prairie of the Gayway movement. And for me, it's pretty strongly associated with my decade in the closet going to Prairie of the Gayway Therapists working at a Prairie of the Gayway Ministry having some really painful, psychologically destructive experiences. So that phrase has a lot of baggage for me. Whereas I'm a part of a community of Christians who are Christians and convinced of a traditional sexual ethic and use the word gay to describe themselves. Just using the word gay to mean boys who like boys or girls who like girls. Nothing more, you know. And that's how most people in our world today use the word gay. It doesn't, they have an assumption that every human will seek out romantic relationships with people they're drawn to. But that's also baked into the word straight. And I mean, actually, if you look at people also expect Christian marriages to divorce with the same rate as non-Christian marriages. So I mean, if people's associations with words should keep them from using it, then we should not call our Christian marriages Christian marriages because they actually tell a lie about what they're supposed to be. You know, anyway, so it's just a longer conversation about words and what they mean. So for me, when I use the word gay, I use it because it doesn't have the baggage that same sex attraction does. I use it because my primary audience is often gay, non-Christian teenagers and gay, non-Christian young adults. And for them, just using the language that they use means that there's one less barrier to evangelism. If I started exclusively using the phrase same sex attraction and kind of policing that in conversation with non-believers who are gay, that's going to create even more problems to them getting to know Jesus. So and yeah, I'm just, I'm using that word, you know, I'm not using that word ontologically. Like, I'm not using that word to say who I am fundamentally or a or an an essential way. I'm not using that word to just say how got intended me. I'm just using enough in a phenomenal, logical way. The like, this is the word people use to describe people who have the experience I do. So yeah, but I strongly respect people who prefer different language. Yeah, earlier you had mentioned how when you were younger you battled a lot of like self-hate in shame. And so what was the journey or like, yeah, was there like a moment in which you encounter gotten a radical way or it's just years of like hard discipleship that like led you to overcoming that. Like, what was the journey to overcome that coming out, like going from in the closet to out of closet all the shame and and self-hate that you were feeling to now being like open about it and free in Jesus. Like, what was that? What was it like? Right. Yeah, so a lot of it was meeting with some good therapists who weren't trying to make me straight, but we're trying to help me make sense of that, that self-hate and unpack that. You know, there's a lot of bad theology baked into that, you know. It was helpful for me to kind of really clean up how I conceptualized all of this and recognize that this wasn't God's intention for me, but also God is not surprised and God does not blame me for this part of my story and that God's choice not to heal this is not because he doesn't love me and is not because I'm not trying hard enough, but it's just because that's the way it is for most people. And it was important for me to kind of unpack like there's been a sexual sin in my life, but my sexual sin isn't any worse than the analogous straight sexual sin outside of marriage. It's still bad, but there was there was an extra layer of like, oh my gosh, gay sex outside of marriage, it's so much worse than straight sex outside of marriage. And I had to kind of interrogate that, well, why do I think that that is? And I realized, oh, that's just a bunch of homophobia loaded up inside of me. They both equally fall short of God's plan. So it's helpful to clean out some of that. I think the more I shared my story with other believers and they responded with love, the more I started to believe, oh, you know, other people, maybe they're not going to, maybe they actually love me. And won't treat me last because this is a part of my story and then it was easier to see myself that way. And I'd say, and again, this is maybe one of the reasons why I used the word gay, seeing gay people in music and in TV and in movies and in different places, presented as like normal humans. And also, I think helped me recognize that helped me see myself as like normal and I love them. So there's certainly, you know, broken parts about gay culture and broken parts about gay representation in media. For yeah, I think all those things together really helped. So well, and then what has been the experience of finding fulfillment in Christ and like relationship with like your brotherhood that you have? Because I think we, I think we'd all agree that and maybe I think you would, but based on a conversation that God created us for human interaction and human friendship and relationship. Right? And so that is a deep part of how we feel totally loved and fulfilled. But also Christ can't feel a large portion of that, you know, like a say someone gets saved in solitary confinement and they never see humans for a long time. Like I'm sure they can live a, uh, noticeably good fulfilled life in Christ alone. They like a lot of prayer, right? But yeah, coming from like where you're coming from and finding fulfillment in Christ alone, can you comment on that and like how do people who maybe they're just like straight but are not married and they just are like wanting to get married one day, but they're always like, but maybe it's been like years and years and years and years, like how how do I find fulfillment in this? Like in the single this how to find fulfillment and then also coming from the background of a gay Christian, how do you find fulfillment in just Christ alone or the friends and family that you found? Yeah, yeah, for sure. So my story is maybe unique in some ways, maybe not unique in other ways, but, um, you know, I've actually experienced a pretty profound, kind of spiritual drought or darkness or distance over the past nine, 10 years. So I, I pretty intermittently for the past 10 years have experienced God in kind of a feeling way or an undeniable way. And I went through, you know, particularly the early years of experiencing that, you know, very tortured by that and and and believe that it was because I wasn't trying hard enough to connect with God and and followed lots of different people's suggestions of different ways that I could work harder to force God to to connect with me in a way that I feel. And I was, but I was grateful that after a couple years of that, I connected with a pastor who then connected me with some different texts from, uh, kind of, pastors and Christian leaders throughout the ages who have experienced kind of this darkness for a long period of time and and and and kind of normalize that actually maybe for a lot of Christians, they experience an extended period of kind of feeling disconnected from God for a lot of their life, right? Like mother Teresa, you know, shares in her carries for a majority of her super free foe ministry, like clearly the Lord present with her in some way and guiding her felt a profound emptiness, a profound absence of the Lord. And yes, you continue to be faithful and and books like a dark night of the soul by St. John of the Cross and interior castle by St. Teresa of Abla and I'm not Catholic, I'm Anglican, but I find a lot of these resources helpful. Just kind of comforted me that sometimes what God or often what God does when along the summer's path of spiritual maturity, it's kind of when when we're ready to wean off of spiritual milk and move towards something else, you know, one of the things that's true of being a baby Christian is it's easy for us to become more infatuated with his gifts than with the given. Well and one of the very common ways it seems throughout the ages that God then has disciple of his people is to then remove the gifts in a way that leads to desert and emptiness and distance and slowly or perhaps over a lifetime the person learns, relearns to love the giver absent the gifts. Well and not because they're doing anything wrong but that's just God's plan for how he's going to disciple them. So anyway that's unfortunately been my story, it's certainly not my preference but I've kind of settled into that's my reality and I choose to believe the God exists and I choose to live as if a person who who felt God fully and my my hunch is maybe God finds something delightful about a faith that truly this is a way you're for me. You know truly I have no reassurance that this is real but nonetheless I'm I'm I'm all in. So so anyway so so in light of that one of the things that my pastor then said was that then maybe God won't meet maybe you won't feel God in a direct way but one of the reasons why God gave us human family why God gave us Christian marriage and why God gave us you know vocational single people living in intentional Christian community God gave us these different forms of of Christian human family is for us to experience the love of God through other believers and particularly with people that we kind of live in kind of a permanent daily kind of embodied way is where it's easiest for us to receive God's love through kind of healthy relationship with other believers and so that was part of his encouragement for us to start the national family of brothers is Peter you need a robust experience of human family because that might be the the only way that you experience God's love and and and and he and as a married person he said and like my marriage is one of the primary ways that I experience God's love and and and that's good you know so so yeah that that has been a lot of kind of why you know we started the national family of brothers and you know it's it's I think just like a marriage you know well not just like a marriage similar to a marriage in some ways you're really able to love someone in the in the in the healthiest ways and receive someone else's love in the healthiest ways when you believe that they are actually committed and when you believe that they won't leave when when they won't when you can trust them and so that's been a lot of what we've been so rebuilding in the national family of brothers is is is building kind of shared time with each other and and guys kind of increasingly making longer commitments to our community building up to making lifetime commitments to our community so that our hearts can really trust that oh we can we can trust like that we can receive God's love consistently in this space so so that's been a big part of my story and honestly you know I I I speaking to the kind of the the the the other part of your question a little bit more briefly you know to the person who single but maybe doesn't prefer to be single for a lifetime but it is wondering kind of how do I find family in the body of Christ in the short term you know I think it's important to think about there's actually three major relational categories in scripture there's the singleness we're all born into okay they're stepping out of that singleness into marriage and they're stepping out of that singleness for all born into into the kind of committed intentional singleness for the sake of the kingdom that Jesus talks about in Matthew 19 and Paul talks about in first Corinthians seven those are distinct you know and and the early church understood that kind of singleness that Jesus and Paul was talking about was a permanent giving up of the prospect of Christian marriage and that was the unanimous understanding of like three decades of church fathers and mother so like pretty clear that's probably Jesus and Paul's intentions so I don't know if it's really healthy for Christians to continue in that uncommitted you know temporary singleness that were born into for long into their 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s you know I guess my prayer for every Christian is that they would get busy settling down into Christian marriage or settling down into vocational singleness and I don't really have a solution for how to find robust family and uncommitted singleness but the early church has a pretty robust solution for if you commit to vocational singleness how you can find family at the body of Christ and that's it's something similar I think to what we're doing in the national family brothers people can certainly you know organize less formal intense intentional Christian community but I think that's to any single person out there who thinks they might be single long term and they're saying you know I need more than just revolving door of roommates and small groups I need something permanent I just want to affirm like I think the Lord put that desire in your heart for something permanent he made all of us for permanent family so yeah hang on to that and explore that with leaders in your community how might you be able to form build cultivate something where you can actually get permanent live-dude family that's really powerful and speaking to the the first thing that you said about the separation from God or not feeling as presence I was listening to a philosopher yesterday and he was talking about how only on this earth could we experience the kind of faith building or soul building that could happen with the absence of feeling God's presence when you know that he's real because in heaven you could never grow that kind of faith because you're in the presence of the Lord so it's really interesting something a value that you could that you could take from that going on to one of our last questions this is a pretty contentious topic but we'd love to ask it and know your opinion many many Christians when discussing this topic have very different opinions on should someone if they're coming out as gay trying to continue in that like with that terminology or should they try to stop being gay like you can't talk about at the beginning should we try these their ways we try to convert to be straight and kind of ethane touched on that a little bit should Christians try to do that at all if you're if you're same-sex attracted or should we just accept how we are born or or evolve right right yeah so we're going to chat a bit about you know it's not God's intention for people to develop same-sex attractions it's a brokenness it's a result of the fall um I also want to recognize God absolutely can do miracles and God does miracles still and so sometimes people ask for God to change their sexual orientation any does you know and I believe people when they tell me when they show that kind of testimony with me I also know that you know scientific studies show that um 96% of the time when someone seeks out sexual orientation change efforts they don't experience any change in their sexual orientation um and and those stats you know anecdotally match the hundreds of gay people that I know Christian and non-Christian who have sought in various forms sexual orientation change errors so you know but that three to four percent of the time you know sexual orientation change does happen and that seems like the frequency of a miracle so yeah you know I accept that you know I think it challenges those same studies found that for people for gay people who seek out sexual orientation change efforts they're risk of suicide attempts increases by 92% wow whoa so the likelihood that they will if they if they attempt sexual orientation change efforts the likelihood that they will attempt suicide nearly doubles um so you know doubling suicide attempts 96% ineffective at changing your sexual orientation you know for me as a therapist or as a as a god parent if I'm imagining my god son being in that position or my like friends I care about deeply like that's not a deal right like I just and sound worth it to try to me you know yeah so you know I don't you know um I'm certainly not judging anyone for asking the Lord to change as part of their story or exploring some some some ways that they hope that they might reduce their same sexual actions or increase their opposite sex attractions I completely understand the the yearning to the time you're leaving from from that brokenness and for for that not to be a part of what we have to do we have to deal with but it does seem like you know it's it's it's spiritually and and psychologically dangerous um so you know so what well instead of that at least for me I have I'm I kind of moved on from asking you got to change my sexual orientation instead I started focusing on God how are you going to use my enduring brokenness for your glory and for my good and I've already shared that how I've seen that to be true um so um you know yeah it's going to be difficult but you know often when I meet with counseling clients who want me to help them change their sexual orientation you know I I first I'm clear with them I don't know how to change people's sexual orientation there or no there are no interventions that are proven to be effective but can we talk about you know why why you want that and and and if you want to pray or they ask me to pray for them either in session or outside of session hey will you pray for me as well that the God would change my sexual orientation you know I say well you know tell me why why you really hope that that's what God would do and I said and more importantly can you share with me if God chooses not to change your sexual orientation what then you know how would you do with that and and for a lot of them they reveal that basically well if God's not willing to change my sexual orientation then I'm not willing to follow his wisdom well and and then that opens up a really a lot of opportunity a lot of really fruitful conversation with them about you all is that it sounds like you're kind of giving God an ultimatum you know is that is that wise for a believer to do you know what's the risk of that so and then we get all into that conversation and we tell you know and for many of them it's they've got some of the same broken ideas mixed up ideas that I did thinking that well if I'm this way that must mean that God meant for me to be this way you know they don't they don't have well well it would be cruel for God to not mean for me to be this way but not change it so you know all those kind of things that we've already discussed we can we we go in and unpack all of that so so yeah so so long story short I don't judge anyone who who praise the God but change our sexual orientation or is seeking out kind of help with that but but I have found it to be harmfully ineffective and I and I and I often find it interesting to to to question you know hey what what's your motivations for that what happens if God doesn't you know are we prepared for that possibility because what's most important to me is as you continue following Jesus and and believing that He loves you and has good things for you. Awesome that's really good yeah great answer so as we're coming to the end of our show we like to ask everybody the same question because our show is founded on the idea that people have hard questions for Christianity that are answered well a lot of the time we'd like to ask everybody comes on our show what is the main thing in your life that you've experienced it could be an argument it could be an experience that is made you question your faith we want to ask these questions so we can tackle the scary areas of scary questions that people come up with in their own minds and address them and and sort of demystify them and how to do overcome it as well yeah how to do overcome it and if you start with it that's totally fine too so for you what was that experience or question that really made you doubt that crisis who he said he is that God exists anything like that yeah so I I mean I think the biggest thing has been this you know this kind of ten year distance silence that I felt you know and I can imagine like you know a number of a lot of your audiences a little bit more charismatic you know they might be alarmed and really sad I might be happy you're about you know the the distance I've experienced from God but yeah I mean I think I brought it some it led to many multiple crises of faith multiple times when I well this God even exists and and and what do I do with that and and how do I continue in faith with doubt so you know I also don't want to undersell that there may be many people who are experiencing kind of a short-term felt distance from God and and maybe a switching up their spiritual disciplines a bit will lead to feeling more connected with God so I don't I don't want to suggest that you know well I just not been feeling God for a month so I just give up you know yeah but for those who do find despite efforts that this seems to persist I think the question of you know why would someone choose to continue to believe God exists if they continue if they consistently don't feel him and and you know and is that a good wayger is that a good risk you know at least for me the the the way I kind of convinced myself is like a version of Pascal's wayger which is if there is no God well this is all meaningless like this is kind of 80 years of chaos in a blip of meaningless eternity and really no matter how I spend my life it's a waste because it has no meaning or if there's a God and that God is the God of the Bible then I'm convinced that the way I'm living out my life is the most worth it you know yeah so you know I just so I'm gonna do that right and hope that God exists because of so that but you know but that might not be convincing for for everyone but but that's kind of how I I make sense of it at my head yeah and that's kind of all you can do like if you don't have an experience of a God you can kind of fall back on every Christian should be convinced philosophically in my opinion that the model of theism is the most logical model and then convinced through Christ's life just simple Christianity that that we should be Christians based on not theistic model I think it's it's very I'm very good yeah and something that I always come back to when I'm in those seasons where it feels like it's like maybe spiritual quiet or or dry as I've like found myself like well what am I upset about well I'm upset about that I don't have an emotional closeness or feeling but I thought like what have I never get that though like is it worth it to follow Jesus if it's not guaranteed it's what have I never again feel like I used to when I was younger and do what happened of reasons to still follow Jesus and that's when you get into like philosophical historical arguments and then if you can like acknowledge wow okay philosophically it would got existed probably something like this and then if okay if there's one God look at all the religions one God and then figure out where you want what you're capable I think Christianity is the most valid obviously why I'm so Christian yeah and then I also think to myself like well yeah like why do I think I'm entitled to a to a emotional presence of God and and one I always like is that like the normal state of Christianity through all throughout history like how there's millions of Christians for over the last 2000 years and how many of those millions of millions of Christians have similar stories where they're like yeah I haven't felt them in in 20 30 40 years but I trust that he exists and I trust that he's gonna care for my soul have you know what I think I think it shows a beautiful picture of like genuine discipleship words like hey like I don't I don't always see this but I'm gonna keep following because I trust that's true and I trust God and if nothing else when I die on a terrorist presence you know and it'll be okay yeah and so I think I always I think I I commend people who have that mentality because it's like wow like yeah you're really in it for a long haul and you really like come to cost and really stuck to it and you're in a contagious sick to it and that's very worthy of celebration yeah yeah go. Sweet well with that guys thanks for coming back and listen to another week of the podcast Peter thank you for coming on it's been an a really exciting talk I really am I've been wanted to have this type of talk for a long time with someone who's like had the same experiences you has still a Christian and now has the whole ministry and a lot of authority on the subject and so it's been it's been an honor having you on so thank you so much and there's anywhere you want to plug for our audience so they can find you yeah the best way to check out some more resources and kind of articles and videos that explore a lot of the questions we did today is my website p-i-e-t-e-r-l-v-a-l-k dot com and then you can also find me on Twitter and Instagram Facebook with that same handle Peter L-Valk P-i-e-t-e-r-l-valk so yeah we love to continue conversation with with anybody and you can reach out to me over socials or over email through the website if anyone has any questions but yeah thank you guys so much for the opportunity to be a part of this conversation today yeah thank you's really and you guys know where to find us so we're not gonna say that again all right see you next week
