 Hi, I'm Robbie. Let's enter the Grey Zone. Welcome again to the Grey Zone podcast. I am Robbie and thank you as always for listening. I'm Robbie and thank you for listening. We're going to be on the podcast. We're going to be on the podcast. We really test our theology. Where our theory goes to die and we actually wrestle in nuanced ways with the challenging topics of faith and culture. Today our guest is someone I really admire a lot. Peter L. Volk is an author and speaker. He writes about discernment, a coaching and training solution for churches aspiring to be places where gay people thrive according to God's wisdom. He is also an aspiring English and teacher and hoping to pursue his ordination in that tradition as well. One other thing that Peter does as well if that wasn't enough. This is also a founding member of the Nashville family of brothers and ecumenically Christian monastery building family in Nashville for men who are called to kingdom single this. That topic primarily is what we'll be talking about with Peter today. The issue of being single and why it shouldn't be an issue but actually should be something that is leveraged and used by churches and by individuals to do kingdom work. I don't know about you but I have never heard a sermon that was preached about single this. That was empowering. That was about the good of it. That wasn't just about waiting until eventually you get to be married and be lucky like everyone else. Instead Peter challenges us to hold both marriage and celibacy at the same level of importance and significance in the church today. He also really is a proponent of making sure that we have the same level playing field for how we view our sexual ethics for people who are gay for people who are straight for people who are married for people who are single that we should all be making sure that we are holding people to the same standards. I think you're really going to enjoy this conversation. I love Peter. He's full of life and full of faith and thank you for listening and joy. All right. Well, welcome to the Grey Zone podcast. I am very excited to be joined by someone who I think is a real blessing to the church and someone who I've gotten to sort of no online as well as you can. No someone online. And so we're joined today by Peter L. Volk Peter and the words of Doc Ock. Hello, Peter. Welcome to the podcast. Yeah. Thanks for having me on. You're so welcome. Well, I think we should start by for those people who don't know your work and are familiar with what you do. Would you you can do a better job than I could do it justice. Give us a little spill on the sort of the spaces that you work in and your professional life. Yeah. So the the shorter version is that I get to write and speak about vocational singleness and LGBT plus topics according to a biblical sexual ethic and discernment in a very various spaces. And my kind of nine to five job is I'm the founder and executive director of a group which is a ministry that does training and consulting for churches that one of a come places where LGBT plus people embrace and thrive according to historic Christian sexual ethics and we've trained over 35,000 Christian leaders which super grateful that we get to be a part of that work. I'm in the Anglican churches in North America and I'm in the ordination process there. So, and then you know, a little bit on the more personal side, I personally feel called to vocational singleness which we'll talk about that more. I'm sure. And then the context of vocational singleness, I find, I kind of find my family. I call home the Nashville family of brothers, which is kind of an personal Christian community, a modern monastery for men in Nashville who feel called to leverage their singleness for the sake of Kingdom work, for the sake of caring for the poor in the needy and their city with their availability. But also feel like they need kind of stable lived and community in order to be faithful to their calling and so I'm a part of that. And then I'm also a licensed professional counselor and often meet with people navigating questions of faith and sexuality and gender. And you know, I don't know how much we'll get into it today, but I mean, one of the reasons why all of these things matter to me and I get to be a part of all these different kind of areas of Kingdom work is because I'm on a Christian and because I experience same sex attraction on gay and because I'm personally convinced of and committed to a historic Christian sexual ethic and I think that it's God's best for every Christian, including me. And part of that journey for me has been kind of asking the Lord like, what gift does he want to give me? And eventually becoming convinced that God wanted to give me the gift of vocational singleness. And then since then it's been a journey of leaning into this gift is good. I know that and that's it's it's not automatic, you know, a thriving in one's vocation. You know, there's work of kind of been taking the gift that you've got almost like a starter for some bread and then you've got to do the rest of the work to actually make a beautiful loaf. And so that's been the journey. Some of the past decade has been how do I make vocational singleness good for me and the other people I'm doing that alongside. That's awesome. And I think I think we went unpack that term a little because I had never encountered vocational singleness until I came across your work. And I think it's a great way to kind of frame it. But how would you describe it to someone it's the first time I've ever hearing that. Yeah, so maybe first I would say that we are let me introduce three terms. Common singleness vocational singleness and Christian marriage. So I think all of us are born into common singleness. We're all single when we're married. You know, we're not, excuse me, we're all single when we're when we come out of the womb. We're not married yet. And it's common. It's universal. It's that single is everyone experiences. And then I think the Lord and I think we see this in the scriptures invites us in our teens and in our 20s and our 30s to ask God. Which gift do you want to give me? You know, the gift of singleness, the kind of vocational singleness spoken about in Matthew 19 and first Corinthians seven or God you want to give me the gift of marriage. And and step out of kind of that born into common singleness into either Christian marriage or an intentional single. So what is that intentional singleness that vocational singleness. What is that exactly? And that kind of comes from Matthew 19 and and first Corinthians seven. I define that vocational singleness as a lifetime call to abstinence singleness. For the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention. And so when someone feels like they have the calling to vocational singleness with their saying yes to is saying I'm at a pass on marriage and sex and from the most probably raising kids raising biological children. And I'm going to study all of the focus and time and energy I would use to be a good spouse and a good parents to kind of singularly focus on maybe some some kingdom work. Some ways that my city or my broader community is broken and hurting that are really making it hard for people to believe that Jesus is real and Jesus loves us and Jesus is good. And instead give kind of an intensity of focus to addressing that that poor in that needy and that lack in my world. So that hopefully actually over a lifetime I can make a big difference in that and not only makes people's lives better, but then people you know turn to to vocational singles and say wait a minute. So you passed on sex and marriage. You spent your life caring for people on the margins you made things better why. And the answer we would give was Jesus. You know like we think Jesus is worth it and we think the whole thing that Jesus is inviting every believer into is to be a part of his. Make the world right project that we're doing in part now and we'll do you know Jesus will finish when he returns. And so that is vocational singleness. But I don't think and we'll tease this out more I'm sure but I don't think vocational singleness is they call to loneliness for the sake of the gospel. I think it's still a call to meaningful family in the body of Christ. And that's in the early church people who are walking out Matthew 19. First Corinthians 7. Singleness. We're enjoying lots of relationship and intimacy and deep friendship in the body of Christ. And I think we need that same thing today. That's so well said. I think I think I love the way that you talk initially about leveraging it. Right. There's an intentionality to this form of singleness, this celibacy. And it's it's removed from maybe the common conceptions of this is what monks do. This is what you know all you know it's an archaic tradition and it's sort of around and cool robes guys. But you're in a much different space where you're like this this is an intentional choice and action that was prayerful and holy spirit led to use essentially the freedom the lack of biological and marital times which are good and have their place to instead use that space to almost double up. But one could do you know as Paul says he's like if you can't don't because you can do so much more for the kingdom like I've got no one to worry about but what I'm doing. And I think we we're in a culture where single this is you know it's either frowned upon or that extra leveraging is you know for you to hustle and live your best life and who needs a man you know who needs a woman I'm just going to do my own thing. Yeah, the. And to be clear, I'm not I don't mean to suggest that being a being married being a parent is not kingdom work in itself you know particularly that work of raising kids in our churches really important the kingdom work. And I talk to any of the the young parents of young kids in my life and their exhausted from that really good kingdom what they're doing. And and their attention and their focus and the kind of the first fruits of their kingdom work is spread thin and divided. And rightly so they're saying they're they've said yes to the calling that they have on their life. But yeah there's I get into the little with twins research in a season past about like. How much more time does a person committed to vocational singles actually have to do kingdom work and are the earning they're anyway the put numbers to this and there's some research about. The average this is from the US bureau of labor and statistics the average number of hours a US parent spends parenting if they are a parent. And you do the math it's the equivalent of two decades of 40 hour work weeks. So if most of us are working from age 25 to 65 we're working for decades 40 years of 40 hour work weeks. The amount of time that parents then additionally spend on raising kids is another. 20 years of 40 hour work weeks that's the equivalent of that they spend you know so it's another plus 50 percent. Time and energy that they're spending on raising kids which is good work again good work. But imagine someone in vocational single is who can instead of spending that extra 50 percent on the kingdom work of raising kids they reinvest that in the the the nine the the the the the kingdom work they're doing in their nine to five job. And and there their focus is not scattered their their attention is not run thin they don't have to kind of go back and forth from from different tasks and different kingdom work kind of priorities. And so there there's a real practical opportunity there to deal with some of these tricky kind of social like wounds in our culture and in our cities and in our neighborhoods in ways the parents don't have the time energy to do. So yeah yeah that's excellent I can definitely a test of the fact that it feels like yeah. Multiple work weeks a week for sure and I've only been in the right years so yes you see the bags under my eyes that's why we don't go so I'm going to go 4k 1080p makes me look. It's good yeah it's forgiving but that you know that's and that's so good because you're you're because we do have it's not like people aren't single. But we have even even Christians you know not disparaging leave it they'll they'll take that extra time and it's like I'm going to take extra pickations I'm going to just. You know travel and go to you're nothing wrong with those things but you're this is a targeted sell to see this is a like because I am not raising this family and doing that great good work I am going to. I'm going to go all in with all this time that I have because that time actually still belongs to God. And that's that's really powerful yeah I only encountered this as a challenge. You know I don't know 15 years ago maybe a little less than that I read some some of Sam Albre's work and stuff and I found him confronting because he's like. It's good that we have celibate people they can do these things as you're saying they can you know they can work tirelessly and do the five you know events that week for the big church conference or whatever or. You know commit to social project but we as churches are not set up to offer good loving community to people who are single. And he he makes this argument that I think I've heard you echo it's like you know just because it's a you know a single male and is like 20s doesn't mean that he doesn't need healthy positive relationships with children. And with you know teenagers and you know people that you would intermix with if you were in more traditional family spaces you know. And we need we need cousins and aunts and uncles and and the village and that unfortunately is really lacking and so. So you you went and you founded with your extra you know 5,000 hours a week that you get. You not only became an LPC but you went and you founded this brotherhood tell us about the brotherhood the Nashville brothers that's what is called. Yeah the Nashville family of brothers. Yeah I when I sort of feeling clarity that I was called to vocational singleness. And I guess to that from from the Lord, but I push back on God I guess a little bit and I said okay, but I don't want to be lonely. You know I I still need companionship. Human companionship in the body of Christ and God said great. You know like I've still made you for that go get it you know. So I don't know you can't have that right. Yeah and so I went to the past for my church and I said hey I think I'm called to vocational singleness but I don't feel like I have some magical gift of celibacy that all I need is to. You know sit in my prayer closet and then all of my love tank is filled you know I need I need more than that. So you know how can I meet my intimacy needs in healthy ways. In kind of the body of Christ at this local church and that pastor answered really honestly he said well. I don't think you're going to find the kind of family in the body of Christ that you need at this church or any church in Nashville anytime soon. Because and he is person was personally married but had some close friends who are walking out long from celibacy and he knew. And he said but the most common way that celibate people have found family throughout the history of the church has been monasticism. Some form of monasticism and so he said I think you should go. Look for a monastery in Nashville that you could be a part of and if it doesn't exist which there aren't as far as I know any monasteries in Nashville for for men. Then I think you should start some kind of intentional Christian community some kind of modern monastery for celibate men in Nashville. To to kind of meet that need for family keep going to our local church teach our church how to do family in the body of Christ better. And then maybe by the time you die this intentional Christian community will be unnecessary because our church will get better at this and the next generation of celibate Christians can just find this at our church. And it was called was his challenge. And and and so myself and another guy who goes to that church we said yes to that invitation essentially and that was eight years ago we started gathering some single people in our lives and. And so I'm just going for for meals and and praying and kind of contemplating hey if we started an intentional Christian community will be to look like and and who is good calling to be a part of this thing. Fast forward to to today there are there are four of us that live in a house together as a family and we we pray together every morning before we go to work and we do three kind of family meals it will at least three dinners together a week. And we do the patients together and we do you know some of the big holidays together we did Christmas together last year and we'll do thanks him together this year and. And and we're living together as a family as we kind of discern kind of how God is calling us to leverage each of our nine to five jobs for the sake of the kingdom and as we're discerning kind of like is God calling us to be a part of a community like this long term. But we're also like normal Christians you know we we actually go to to different churches so it's not a replacement for our local church. We all have jobs outside of our house and and not all of us are in full-time ministry you know there's a variety of things we do. And we're still very connected to our biological families and to you know families at our churches and the kids and and different outside of our community. But yeah we have this this home that that where we find family and so I'm really grateful for for that challenge from my pastor. To to lean into this and and I'm honestly compared to what most single people have I feel pretty pretty spoiled. And it certainly sounds like it and it's like I'm sitting here thinking about you know the the constant talk about the loneliness epidemic we have and and this is not just a you know American problem it's it's happening in other countries and they're addressing this issue and. I just wonder how much of that would be solved with a little bit of creative thinking of. Oh I don't have to just have an apartment by myself and hope to be married one day to fix the loneliness or like he said I don't have to crawl into a prayer closet and let God be all that I you know engage with not that that can't be satisfying and that God can meet that but. What a creative way because then you guys are like you said you do in your own jobs you still. And it functions like a normal family right my wife goes to her job I go to my job there in separate places we come together for meals we spend time with our children we get up and do it all again so it's such a. For you've been in a while but I'm sure you still appreciate it's a little bit of a creative radical idea and I don't think I'm under selling that term. You know like any church that I've been in the only time singles ever talked about is. Striving and just keep waiting and God's going to bring that person. Sure. And so it's just black and white approach you know to you know to bring in the idea of the podcasts right you have like you get married or you don't get to get married. And those are just the only options in order to enjoy a life that's rich and connect to the community and you said you you hit that sort of resistance you know early on I think. Yeah I mean it's in some of what. Is a little bit of a bummer for me is that I know that. Vocational single this win supported well can be this huge resource of kingdom work energy for our churches. But the opposite also can be true if we have a lot of single people in our churches who are not experiencing. Family in the body of Christ who are not meeting their intimacy needs in healthy ways who are lonely. And then either spending all their time dating or spending all their time going to other coping mechanisms to to kind of solve their loneliness. Then they're not very useful for the kingdom. You know I think almost sometimes actually the people who maybe have the most margin in our churches are married people without kids. And Mary people with kids are spread thin and single people who are lonely are spread thin and maybe the people who have the most like kind of work capacity sometimes are married people without kids. So but what if our churches were supporting singleness well and all of a sudden instead of single people kind of being kind of handicapped in terms of their kingdom work capacity. They were empowered and thriving and multiplied in terms of what they could be doing inside and outside of our churches. So I think it's worth I mean just in a very like practically utilitarian way of approaching it like I think it's worth it for our churches to invest in teaching about and supporting vocational singleness. Because I think there's a lot of service and leadership on tap there if there was health amongst single people particularly because if they were meeting their loneliness in healthy ways. Yeah, I absolutely agree with you. I think the first time I had a conversation with you I'll talk to you going we have atrophy in the body of Christ. And it's we have let singleness be a condition to change. And and so they're just sitting around and like you said we've got a lot of people who could be have capacity potential but they're just kind of you know walking along where they don't think there's a place for them there. So even seeing and hearing people like you say. I'm pursuing you know pursuing this level in the in the culture, and I'm an LPC and I'm doing all these things intentionally and living the life that God has called me to. It just gives so many other people an example of. I never thought of that because we'd meet a lot of people now. We're like I don't even want to get married you know and a lot of that's negative feelings about marriage but. Imagine that opportunity imagine a church empowering and showing like. That we hold this vocational single people in our church at the same level as the married people in our church and everything in between because. Again, body multiple parts and multiple functions, you know, but you have to hear it and it makes sense and I don't think anyone's talking about it enough, which is why I love that you're out here. Well, and part of it is maybe we need more accessible. And models or or visions for what it could be like like I just as you brought up at the very beginning of the podcast episode that sometimes our reference points for this are modest state legit you know traditional modest areas and monks and nuns and it seems like the only options are this extreme. The only two options and I don't you know, I feel like I lacked kind of the mental image for what does it look like to be an ordinary. I don't have to go to the question called to singleness for the sake of the kingdom what does that look like you I had no idea and so I you know I want to encourage the listener that you don't have to go commit to lifetime vocational singleness tomorrow and go start an intention a lifetime intentional Christian community tomorrow. And I think that's the reason is you could just commit to for a year what if I am intentionally don't date. And I use the time and energy that I might have used dating to instead serve the kingdom serve the poor in the needy. And I think that's the reason why I'm trying to be a long side some other people. Not because I'm trying to pay off some I'm trying to be a good enough Christian but because I actually think you're going to find both marriage and singleness the purpose of it is to be generative it is to serve it is to it is to cultivate life. We're going to experience deeper satisfaction in our marriage or in our singleness if we are using it for the sake of something. You know and so I think you're actually going to enjoy that year of singleness more if you intentionally kind of spend it to bless others. Enjoy the the the work of blessing others do it shoulder to shoulder next to other believers who you enjoy their presence you know having a good time. So do that for a year and maybe for that year. Move into an apartment complex with a couple of other single people and just for a year. Do life together with a little bit of an intentionality. Every maybe a couple couple weekday mornings you guys gather together before everyone goes to work and you pray together some simple pray you know maybe you do one or two evenings a week that you do a meal together. Maybe you decide to do go on a vacation together or do some kind of retreat together once a quarter twice a year. I mean you can give it really simple. But there's just these small first steps we can take to to step into what if I leveraged my singleness a little bit more. And was a little bit more intentional about having community in singleness I think people would be surprised how much once you get that ball rolling. That the rest is not as is not as difficult or at least it's not as difficult to imagine or to know what to do next. So yeah, I think I think what you do really well is you're giving us the ability to like this could be different like just use your imagination a little and you'd be surprised that God is not so limited as we have maybe unintentionally made him you know like you're getting me thinking about what if are you know youth programs that talk about preparing for marriage spend as much time also talking about the potential for cell to see. What if that was one of the two you know choices that young people are growing up being disciples into considering I may need to go this way or that you know and I need to after I heard you talk and everything you know I prayed and I was like God forgive me for not even giving you the opportunity to let me know if that was a calling. Because I'm married and I'm in it and obviously that's not changing but I was like I repent to it. I was like I should have at least thought maybe that would have been something that he would have called me to. And so we intend to do that with our kids of just you know at least fostering both as potential paths that God could carry you on in both are wonderful. Yeah, that's okay. Which it's it's healthy regardless of where teams up teams end up because if he's we're going to get going to be called a Christian marriage anyway. It means that those individuals won't take it for granted as much right they'll see it as a genuine gift. They won't see it as something that's just automatic and assumed they'll see it as something that God has called them to and there's a way to nest to that calling there's a responsibility to that calling. So all of that is is healthy for the for the teen or the young adult who ends up being called to Christian marriage. Then for the individual who ends up being called to vocational singleness. We won't be setting them up for this like false hope that their lie that they are by every that everyone is called to Christian marriage or the God is cheating them of something. If God doesn't call them to Christian marriage and it prepares them to think. Yeah, open mindedly open handedly about what might the Lord call me to but also you know we we we want people to we want teams to actually be excited about this possibility of vocational singleness and so. If we have a healthy kind of theology and and and storytelling in our churches about hey here's the cool kingdom work that singles are able to do it's not better than but is different than what some parents are doing that's that's pretty cool. Here's ways that they're still finding family in the body of Christ it's not a cult of loneliness it's a call like even today I was talking to some some students who just graduated from college and are discerning what's next for them in terms of. Ministry and and faith and work and I was talking about how what I live in in many ways is just kind of like a. A grown-up Christian fraternity you know and I was in a Christian fraternity in college I loved it that was some of the best parts of my of my college years was that Christian fraternity. You know when you think about where I'm living today don't think about a boring no fun nunnery. Think about a Christian fraternity that never stops having a good time for the sake of the Lord like that that's where I'm living you know that's pretty cool and I just I don't I think it's a lot of teenage guys who if they imagine. That could be a possibility you know like David's mighty man going out and kicking ass for the sake of the kingdom and then coming home and clanking beers like that's pretty great I think that's pretty great. Let's go right now. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. I was I was a Christian fraternity to actually it was there there's some of the best the best man I knew you know it was perfect for that time in my life and yeah. I know and how many men are missing that you know to gain that sort of connected this with other males you know you have to go down to you know. Traditional fraternities which you know. God help you if you end up there good luck getting out that that can be pretty ugly and stuff or. Yeah. Anyways, I want to ask you this question and you've already kind of covered a little bit I want to make sure there's any other spaces that we didn't see. What should non Christians know about Christians in your opinion. So this might be a little bit of a change turn here but you know you you work with you your clinician you work with people who are working with same sex attraction gender gender dysphoria as well I think. And you you're very clear on your website I wouldn't say like you like we don't do conversion therapy we're not doing that sort of right. That stuff that clearly doesn't work and actually hurts people. But you also are in the cell to space and in the English and church which I love I read anglic and English and literature just for fun because it's beautiful and I didn't grow up with little. But it's a question I'd like to ask so in the spaces you inhabit and you're encountering non Christians what's what's a mindset you seem to run up against a lot that you would like to try you wish they would get it. A little bit clear. Yeah, yeah. I think there is. I think what's tough is you know Christians sometimes we get ourselves in trouble by. By saying with confidence and with clarity you know what we know to be true. Or that there is a god of the universe who demands who who is worthy of total obedience and when we have no right before him to demand anything else you know. We don't say those things directly but we you know we send the vibes of some of those things. And then and I think reasonably people then expect us if we really believe that to be living as that that we're true. And then holding us to our same standards to our own standards you know judging Christians pretty harshly for sometimes being pretty crappy people. And I think it's pretty obvious when you sit down and think about it but but maybe at first glance it's not to the average person who's not a Jesus follower is that just like Christians are just as messed up as anybody else. And I think a Christian in a healthy place if you millity would say I'm not a Christian because I'm better than people who are not believers and then wearing the Christian label is a reward for being better. I'm a Christian because I realize I've got lots of wounds and and I'm a hurting person and I'm a hurting person that hurts other people unfortunately in my hurt and I just want the world to be a better place than that you know and there's this Jesus guy who's offering the story of saying. Yeah you've you made some mistakes and you've made your life worse and you've made some other people's lives worse and I'm going to give you a moment on that. But part of being a part of my family and we give you a moment on that is is I want you to join my my job my mission of making the world better for everybody. And bringing some healing to things hurting places in your own life but in the lives of others and I've got kind of a weird strategy but trust me you know if you actually spend your life. I'm willing to kind of suffer for the sake of others you'll actually weirdly experience more satisfaction in life and more fullness in life and life will feel more worth it and you'll look somehow by giving of yourself you'll feel more soul. And it's a good life you know like that's what we're all yearning for ultimately you know we all of us maybe want some of the the shallower things in the short term but in a long term I think inside deep inside each of us we want to be. We want to love people well we want good things in our lives we want to see goodness growing in the lives of those around us that we that we care about and we want to to leave the world a better place and that's really what Jesus is about. And so I guess I'm not saying like cut cut cut cut your Christian friends some slack who are who are being crappy people because I think. Because I think if we're going to claim the name of Jesus you know. We should expect it kind of for people to hold us to a high standard in some ways but I guess don't be surprised when when hurting people hurt people including hurting Christians hurt people. And that's kind of what Jesus is all about is stepping into that moment and saying what if we broke the cycle. So. Love that I think I think the way that I know that the spirit of God is that work in you Peter is you are gushing with the joy the Lord. And maybe part of that's personality but I really do you know because you just have an optimism about it you're like this can be great like if we just do this if you just you know yeah we're messed up but man God can make it better and like. Give it a go and you're going to find Christians you're going to find those people we're going to make our churches better and unfortunately there's so much negativity swirling about institutional churches and. Mainline church everything and you're like no no no no no it's it's this simple we just we just got a grasp it we got to put everything for it you know and I think people are you're earning for purpose. And you seem like someone who seems to you you found yours and that's infectious and and you know when when you share that it lifts people you're lifting my spirit so I hope it lifts others but but if we encounter Christians like that if we encountered Christians who weren't. And we're hoping wondering gosh when am I just going to be married so I can finally be happy and they're like well I have this gap and I'm going to take it because I know I serve a good God and he's going to catch me and we're going to do some cool stuff and it's going to be joyful and messy and wonderful. And maybe I'll get married maybe I won't but I know God's going to be in my life no matter what. Yeah well I'm grateful for the teachings of people like well to mention another Anglican in T right and others who have written about like this. This is kind of bigger view of the gospel and not in a way that we're watering down the gospel but realizing that there's a lot more that Jesus did on the cross than just pay for our sins. He also began this really cool project of making everything right and it's just the Jesus paying for our sins part really matters and the rest of it matters just as much. And so I'm really grateful to to to have been a student of some of those things from a distance you know and to to discover that there's just so much Jesus is wanting to do that. It's not about checking off the boxes or memorizing a script that we think we're supposed to say but then big disappointed and he actually is wanting to call us into a really life giving satisfying fulfilling worth it journey. Yeah absolutely and like you call it a vocation. We've got work to do but it's joyful it's so cool when you find your thing and when God leads you into it you know I think most Christians get bored with church aboard with religion because I like. I just sit around I just sit around like do my thing and I give them the money on Sunday and then we go to lunch and like what a boring way to think you're serving God by just attending a service a week and like they're missing out on so much of the life that God gives us and brings us to be a part of you know it's so much better. Yeah so much richer yeah but admittedly the thing that Jesus is calling us into is on its face counterintuitive right he's saying like you know in order to gain your life you need to lose it you know he's saying. You feel like you have lack you feel hurting you feel tired and you feel like you you desire more purpose and satisfaction and what you just trust me. In the short term would you make decisions that involve voluntarily taking on more difficulty in your life for the sake of other people who have nothing to give you in return. And by some kind of magic within within a season that is actually an alligee to be feeling less pain more full more satisfied. And you're going to be proud of the life that you're living. You know again it's just it's counterintuitive but that is like that's what it means to pick up our cross it's not like arbitrary bloodletting it's Jesus saying. The phrase that just came to my mind was that just to say banks you're going to like the way you look. It's like you're going to life you're going to like the way this life feels if you actually try to. You follow in Jesus' footsteps and imitate him by living for the sake of others. You're going to love it but it but yeah it's it's a it's a little bit it's a acquired taste for sure. Absolutely yeah because you know we started to talk about sell this you're giving something up that the world says you should have unless you absolutely want to reject it almost rejected as a sense of self empowerment you know. But look at what you found on the other end that's awesome. I don't want to take a more of your time where can people find them follow you if they want to connect with some of the work that you're doing. Yeah on socials my handle is at Peter L. Volk and it's kind of spelled funny it's got an extra eye in my first name so it's P. I. E. T. E. R. L. V. A. L. K.

Kind of more focus on LGBT plus topics so but yeah I'm I'm really grateful to be a part of these conversations so please don't hesitate to reach out. That's wonderful. Well Peter thank you so much for joining us thanks for showing us that life does not just have to be married or married and happy and single and sad or vice versa depending on your situation but yeah there's there's such there's something richer when we kind of dive into this gray zone space would you be willing to just say a short prayer blessing for our listeners and we can go. Sure. God we are grateful for the the hopes you have for us. The ways you see that we could bring some of the broken curving pieces of our life to you and we could work together to make some pretty cool stuff for ourselves for those love for those are heart. We're looking forward. So I hope in the coming weeks and months you give us the courage to bring some of those broken pieces before you and the wisdom to see what you're calling us to do next. And and we would experience you in a tangible way through our brothers and sisters in Christ because we're going to need some encouragement to step forward into what's next. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
