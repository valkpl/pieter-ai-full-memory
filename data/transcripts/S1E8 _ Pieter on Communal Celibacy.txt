 Hey everyone, my name is Josh Proctor and this is the Life on Side B podcast. On this podcast we are going to discuss as the name pretty much clearly states, what life as Side B, LGBT Christians is really like. For those of you who don't know, Side B is a term used to refer to Christians who are LGBT or attracted to the same sex or have gender dysphoria yet hold a traditional view of sexuality and marriage and therefore live according to that view. Every episode I will be talking with different side B Christians about different aspects of their life, faith and experiences. My goal with this podcast is to show that being side B is not this depressing life of hatred and loneliness, but rather it can be pretty dang beautiful and amazing. Now every season we will be focusing on a different theme of sexuality and faith issues related to the lives of side B Christians. This season though, I am really excited because we are going to be looking at different ways side B Christians live out their sexuality and find intimacy and community. Each of these interviews has been a huge encouragement even for me as I navigate what community and belonging look like in my own life. You will be able to see that there are so many different ways that side B Christians can live with joy within their faith. And in that way, I hope it can be an encouragement for you too. So with that, let's head into today's episode. How are you? Hi everyone. Thanks so much for listening to Life on Side B. We are here for another episode. And today I am joined by Peter Volk. Peter, thanks so much for joining today. Yeah, glad to be here. So to give a little bit of an introduction to Peter. Peter is the director of Equip, a Nashville-based team of missionary consultants who help churches become places where LGBT people can be long and thrive according to a traditional sexual ethic. He is also a clinical mental health counselor that serves LGBT students at a local Christian university. Peter is motivated by the pain and beauty of his story and the stories of his fellow Christian, why can I not speak the stories of fellow gay Christians submitting their sexuality to the Lordship of Christ. You can learn more about his story at EquipYourCommunity.org. Great. I'm so glad that we've even gotten to connect even just a little bit before this, but I'm excited to talk more now. Me too. Although maybe you're treble reading that by a proof that I need to simplify our mission a little bit. No, it proves that I can't read. I've been a long day. That is a true statement. So to start off as I do with everyone, can you share how you identify and what does it mean for you to live side be? Yeah. Um, so in my identity, it depends on the context, whether I'm talking to queer, non-Christian college students or conservative straight pastors. But typically I call myself a gay, pelvic Christian. I think that's probably what I prefer to call myself in the privacy of my own diary. And yeah, what does that mean to me? Like, what does side be mean? And what does the living side be? Looks like for me. I think this has been in a healthy way, talking about some recent discussion online about what exactly is side be and how the students define that. And so for me, it kind of starts with a recognition that we're all broken and part of what my broken this looks like, part of how this follows affected me is that I experience same-sex interactions. That I'm gay in that way. I don't think when God first imagined me, he imagined me to be gay. And so I don't think that was God's intention for me yet. That is my story, my end gay. And while certainly miracles happen, there is no formula for changing someone's attraction, for changing someone's sexual orientation, no proven combination of counseling or spiritual disciplines to help them make that happen. And so the reality is, people don't choose who they're attracted to, people don't choose to be gay. And there's no formula for for changing it. And we also know the God, what I think is side be a traditional sexual acting teaching is, is the God called all Christians to teleboosting or Christian marriage with someone of the opposite of the text. But I think that's more specific than the question of same-sex romantic and sexual activity. There's no context in which God blesses, in scripture or through the teaching of the church, the God blesses same-sex sexual or romantic activity, or to kind of make even clear. I do think same-sex sexual and romance activity are sins in any context. So because on the Christian and because I believe how I know who God is is through the church and through scripture, yeah, that's the sexual, I think I submit my life to and steward my life according to. And so yeah, we'll talk probably talk more about it later, but let me that look like we have some question of, am I called to celebrate the Christian marriage with someone of the opposite sex? And how do I do this well? Yeah. Question. Yeah, absolutely. So kind of with that, then can you share a little bit of how you've come to where you are and reconciling your faith in sexuality? Sure. Hey guys, for me, a point reading of scripture always seems to lead to the conclusion that God wouldn't bless gay marriage, wouldn't bless the marriage between two men or two women. And I was gay and you know, growing up, all the gay people I knew were not Christian and all the the straight people are all the Christians I knew I had soon to restrate. And so I felt like I was stuck somewhere in the middle probably not two different women of the, not people you've talked to before and again, I see that on. But you know, thankfully I, in college I started sharing my story more with the Christian fraternity and can't be in shape, I think it's hard out. And being gay became more normal in wider culture, which I think is really great for the, the mental health of gay people. I want people to be choosing God and choosing to steward their sexual out as a courting to a traditional sexual ethic, not out of fear or coercion, but because they think it's true and beautiful. But that also meant that I needed more than just a plain reading of scripture to be convinced that what it, it musely is a, the cost, a sexual ethic that is costly for me. I needed more to be convinced that was true. So for me, I mean, as an anglican, I have a belief that, uh, the church and scripture are the ways that we know who God is and how he thinks about these topics. And the church and scripture have consistently taught that God calls all Christians to, to sell a C.R. Christian marriage with someone who's the opposite sex. And I mean, yeah, I was able to convince the proper passages and, and argue whether or not those make clear that same sex sexual and mental activity are, or something in any context, but I think what is, is super clear is what God best is for us. So, and then I think there's been my own experiences with same sex-romanic and sexual relationships. And they've made clear for me that that's not God's best for me. Yeah, I haven't experienced everything under the sun, but the ways that I have kind of tested God's promises and safe supplies have confirmed that God promises their true and safe life life. So, and then I think if someone who like teaches and pastors, if you think he just hafters to minister better the people like me, I've been forced to develop kind of some more winsome and nuanced understandings of how sexual orientation develops, what's the possibility for change, what's the morality of merely experiencing same sex attraction, what's the morality of things like sexual and romantic activity, what have got to have to offer gay people in all that. So, but yeah, I think through all that, I guess I've become more deeply convinced that how the church has historically understood God's wisdom on sexual stewardship is true. It's logically true, it's it's experience, truly true. Yeah, yeah, I love what you said about how being gay becoming more accepting has been able to help people, the mental health of gay people and how it leads us into the sense of, you know, it's a you have to choose a innocence of how you're going to live out because I think many times the church gets afraid of the idea of LGBT people having to choose what path they're going to take, kind of wanting it to be an automatic forced decision to be celibate or be in a heterosexual marriage, but it really has to come down to your personal conviction that you, I choose for myself, this it's the same thing that God gives each person we have to choose according to the commissions that God puts on our hearts to follow him in the way that we feel is best and so that choice is many times what leads us to a strong foundation of conviction to follow him. So, I think that's so important and I think we sometimes forget the importance of that choice. So, yes, now, you know, as you've said, you live celibate and for those who are listening, who may not be because I have had a few people listen who were not necessarily used to the term celibate, obviously celibate means that you abstain from all sexual sexual relationships. Correct? So there's capacity, there's celibacy, there's absmints in their singleness. And so, we're very different from each other. They're mean to different from each other and they do get tricky in these conversations. Because historically, so, chastity has meant that you are rightly stewarding your sexuality according to God's wisdom and only in joying sexual and romantic activity in the context that God is ordained and that are best for us. And, in celibacy, as historically, been used to describe those who feel like kind of as described in Matthew 19 in 1st Corinthians 7 that they had been called to the singleness for the sake of the kingdom. And they have permanently given up romance, dating, sex, marriage for the sake of the kingdom. Not so, the word celibacy has meant historically. And then absinit means like refraining it from sex. But I think there's a difference between absinit and what the word celibate has meant to the church for a long time. So anyway, that's how I use those words. I think that's a really good and important distinction. And it's also been surprising to me, I guess just because being a celibate person, you get so used to the term. And then you forget when people come up to you and ask you, well, what does celibate mean? You're like, well, don't you know? At least that's why happens in my brain. And then I forget, no, I guess this is not a normal thing in culture. And that kind of leads me to the next question that actually, you know, so currently I'm reading Mark Yard House's CostsioBDance and loving it by the way. And I thought it was really fascinating that where I'm at in the book at the moment, he asked sidebeep people whether or not they agree with the term can can people live sexually celibate lives while they have same subtractions. And while 99% of the people said, yes, they do believe that people can live celibate. There was three people that said, no, they didn't believe. So and it kind of got me thinking that I really think that's a very common view point in our culture, that it's impossible to live celibate. And so I would love it for you to speak into that that idea that there's probably people listening who are like, that's impossible to live celibate. So how would you interact with a person who believes that? Yeah, and I'm just to get that question from my non-Christian friends or my Christian friend, Joe and more progressive sexual aspect. Surprisingly, I think I get that most fervently from more conservative Christian who thinks that it's impossible to be celibate. The basically, Paul was just, could just do it because he was in a possible Jesus could just do it because he was fully God. And you know, the passage of Scripture would just were just for a certain era of disarray in the church, but less be honest, no one can really be celibate for a lifetime or get something close to being celibate for most of their life. So everyone just needs to get married and then you need to get in the proper Christian marriage. I hear that more often from conservative Christian, and Freakenservative Christian, Mary's Freak and Surred of Christians then I hear it from non-Christian friends or Christians with that progressive sexual aspect. And I'm surprised. Yeah, and my challenge is, is Austin because these are often also people who would call themselves kind of Bible believing Christians. And so my response factor would be let's read what the Scriptures have to say about singleness together. And it seems like Jesus and Paul, in contrast to the way the Jewish people before Jesus came saw so to see the curse. And Mary's was the only good option for the Jewish people. Part of what Jesus did with his life was usher in celibacy of an equally beautiful and normal location and lifting a marriage and giving it even greater being to have for. And he seems to say that everyone should consider. And that it might even be better in some ways. And I don't think he means doesn't hold here. I think he's maybe talking about some kind of like practical benefits for the sake of King the Morpid. The single people can do some kinds of kingdom work that parents can't because they're so busy raising kids. And that raising kids is a really important kingdom work. And then Paul seems to make clear like he basically sitting home at night, praying and pleading with God that all his best friends would be so of it because he thinks that it would be better for them. And he's been so wife of being so that's pretty cool and he hopes that God has that for all the best friends. So yeah, I think scripture seems to suggest that that ought to be possible. And yet what we have in my first country in seven verse nine is Paul can a front thing from challenges the church in Cornstead having with the people who were trying to pursue celibacy. Some of them doing it poorly, some of them doing it for the wrong reason, some of them doing it excellently for the right reason. And I don't think there's any difference than what we see today in the church. I think the other misconception that many times, earphones, people regarding people who are celibate is how we find community, especially when we're single. And so can you talk a little bit into how you found community as a single celibate game yet? Yeah, well, and I think these things are tied because I think some of the reasons why other people in my life haven't skeptical of celibacy have been skeptical if they haven't seen it done well. Yeah, it's not it's not that they don't believe in me. It's that they've all the other evidence they have is that they will this will inform me and they care deeply about me. And what they know is that marriage has brought the most beauty and happiness to their life and they just want me to have the same. And so I think that's like the real challenge of, I mean, hopefully I have a cool opportunity that we have in this era for those of those who are called the celibacy is to do it well and show our friends or parents that it can be beautiful so that they have the confidence to share with their children that it could be beautiful for them. Yeah. So yeah, so how have I found community um, briefly, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not bisexual, so I'm not generally a track and two women, but I did, and they did a couple of women in college and they knew about the part of my story, and I in those dating relationships developed a specific desire for some of them. So I knew coming out of college that if God was calling me to Christian marriage or they woman, that could work. But it seemed to me that I should ask God what he wanted me to do as opposed to go just take what I wanted most. I don't know, it seemed to me they from reading Matthew 19 in first Corinthians 7 that it like the guy has a gift that he wants to give me and it would be who's mean to see to understand which it, I guess it is that he wants to give. And so that started kind of a process of discernment for me of asking God that question and and at least to me at the red scripture that appeared there kind of three options. First option was God is calling you to Christian marriage with a woman and I need to put some more energies into making that happen. And I don't mean becoming more straight. I just mean putting myself out there and going on to the day. Yeah. Or other option was that God was actually calling me to completely close the door on Christian marriage and settled down into and commit to single months for the sake of the kingdom. I mean option three was God wanted me to leave both doors open and continue discerning. And within about two years of discerning that it became pretty clear to me that God was calling me to shut the door on marriage and to settle down into and commit to singleness for the sake of the kingdom. But there's still a question of how am I going to do this well? And for me the biggest question is how am I going to find community? Like how am I going to meet my intimate feelings and healthy ways? So I sat down and met with the pastor, my church who had been having a lot of healthy conversations with sending him hummus, McKinby, here at Church of the River Deamer, Anglican, in Nashville, Tennessee. And I said, hey, how am I going to do this well? And he responded and said, well, a monasticism has in the most common way that seldom men have found family historically. So we need to best way, but if in most common, it's been the greatest source of evangelism in the church historically. It's been the greatest source of theology and the church historically. It's been the greatest source of charity and serving and healing our city in the history of the church. So maybe you should check it out. Can you share a little bit of what is monasticism for those who might not know this? Yeah, I guess it depends on how you define it, but that I would say, men, masters, are a group of men and a group of women, a brampsied women, a women, a women, a community, together, but who feel called to sell the sea. And, but still believe they need a family, they need a way to order their common life. And so they join this, this house, this organization, this monastery that lives under a pool of life. It has essentially like a constitution for their group of people and rules under which how they live their lives. And often they have a common, they have common rhythms as a family of a prayer and devotion and and silent from meals and recreation. And they often have a common mission, kind of external mission. That might be praying from inside of their monastery. There might be going outside of their monastery and teaching in schools or serving the poor and needy or might be running an orphanage within their monastery. There's lots of things that can look like, but it's familiar. It's been a place for fellow men to order their lives together so they can have structure and rhythms in order to do really maximize the kingdom more so that they can do with their single life. Awesome. Yeah. So that was your suggestion. We do consider something like that. So that was like two and a half, three years ago. Fast forward. I looked around and there was nothing like that happening in Nashville. And I know that God has called me to this city. So we got together a group of guys and asked them to join us weekly for dinner and for prayer and to read this book about Christian discernment. And we could use that contact to ask God a lot of questions, but the very least more is every God to ask God the question God, are you calling me to marriage or Philadelphia? And if you're calling me to sell a busie, might you be calling me to help start a monastery in Nashville in which we'd do that together. And then seven, eight months ago or six months ago, two of us made our first commitment to what we now call what we call the Nashville family of brother. And we continue to meet weekly with guys who are considering the possibility for themselves. We live in a home together. Those of you who have made commitments and do daily and weekly rhythms together. And we've got guys outside of Nashville who are interested in this. Some of them just visited so that along weekend and whom we're excited about some of them using two our cities and join our monopsy here in the next few months or so. So yeah, the Nashville family of brothers, our mission is to offer family to celebrate men in Nashville for God's glory. I want to, if I can, I want to break that mission statement down because there's a lot in there. Yeah. So when the first two were their offer family and I think that's the name is the Nashville family of brothers because I think we need family. Historically, when the monopsy system has not portrayed itself as the first reason for it being family and they often don't describe what they're doing as family. But if you visited a monastery or you read any depictions of monastic life even a thousand years ago, they were doing family together. Like this is what monasticism has always been, a way for fellow people to find family. And we think we're made for family. Right? I mean, there's family in the Trinity and the family between God and the Church, if we're made in the image of God, then we're made for family, we need it. And family in the way that Jesus defines it. The family is the, the, for believers, the group of Christians that you do life with and embodied the gospel for each other and together for the world. So yeah, we're here to offer family to the fellow men. We're a monastery, a single-text monopsy, a friend committed to single-ness for the sake of the kingdom and that's a historical definition of celibacy of dating, dating, romance, effects, marriage, and national, that's a context that's the city. And then four God glory, when Paul and Jesus talk about singleness in Matthew 19 and 1st Corinthians 7, they don't say, they're not inviting people into singleness for the sake of not having any dependence so you have more money available to buy the things you want. It doesn't say singleness for the sake of having a lot of free time so that you can become the world best chest player or singleness for the sake of being able to avoid human intimacy and interaction and avoid being, you know, the ironing sharpening iron and the sanctification of dealing with other people's cracking of the them dealing with our cracking. It's singleness for the sake of the kingdom. So we should be using our availability and singleness to do kingdom work and primarily to do kingdom work that are Mary friends with kids can't do because they're raising kids because they're doing that important work. You know, use the time and energy. We would have used for raising kids but we were married and used that instead for work that those parents with kids can't do. And for us, kind of what our primary mission as the national family of brothers are mission to our city is actually to model cellulosee in our churches, to teach our churches about the theology of cellulosee, found in scripture and to help God willing and a future generation helps every young Christian in Nashville to learn whether they are called to cellulosee or marriage with someone of the opposite sex. That's our mission to our city. It's kind of a work of discipleship and it's also a work of multiplication. I mean imagine the difference that would be made if five to 10% of Christians in Nashville and the next generation except that they call to singleness for the sake of the kingdom and they use that availability to do a work of kind of healing poverty and racial tension and xenophobia and all these kind of things in our communities and when people ask why are you sitting your life for these things, they said Jesus. Imagine how many people who come to know Jesus from death. Yeah. So ultimately what we're doing is the work of raising up the next generation, a powerful minority of Christians committed to singleness for the sake of the kingdom so that there can be revival in our city. That's really good. I think it's so important as we were saying that as we talk about cellulosee in among LGBTQ people, we almost talk about a something that's forced upon us but we always have to remember that I think we don't talk enough about the importance of cellulosee for all Christians. That this is not something that only LGBTQ people need to be discerning whether or not I'm called the cellulosee or marriage. It's something that every Christian should be discerning and I think many times in the church we let straight people off the hook saying, oh they don't need to discerning this. They're automatically going to get married but one of the things I love that's come out of for instance my discerning of cellulosee has actually been some of my straight friends have been you know what actually they've said to me, you know what, maybe I'm called the cellulosee. It's possible, you know, and sometimes I've actually wondered this don't have any proof but I've wondered that maybe some of our issues with the divorce rate is because people who are actually called the cellulosee are actually getting married when they weren't called to. Sure, again don't have proof just a thought. But I agree. No, yeah, I was just saying is that I really love that mission of helping people discern whether they're called the cellulosee or marriage and the impact that that can have in our community. Yeah, there's a I think it's a GK Chesterton quote that says when the monks return so well marriage. And what are you getting at with that is this idea that cellulosee and marriage were supposed to be two complementary images that together give a fuller picture of who God is. And so if either is missing, is cellulosee is listed above marriage or more common in marriage or a marriage, a listed above cellulosee or significantly is asking more common cellulosee. Then it doesn't just harm the one that's kind of lower in terms of prevalence and the value it actually hurts the one on top as well. And because, yeah, I think you're right because maybe a lot of people who get into marriage be felt into marriage instead of carefully discerning whether they're called to marriage with a full understanding of how difficult and beautiful it will be. And then with they kind of clear eyes full hearts, I know how hard and beautiful this is going to be and I'm still go for this important location of this important mission in the church of being married and raising children for the second to be good. Absolutely, you know, I didn't get to go to your workshop this year at Revoise, but I did the previous year, 2018. And I really love how you talked about that that we need to have these two equal, as equal options for our communities in the church, marriage and cellulosee side by side in the ways that we, in the ways that we can complement the way that we reflect God and reflect Him on the world. And the way, you know, there's things that single people can do, there's things that single people can do that just married people can't do, they don't have the ability to do it. And the same way there's things that married people can do that single people just can't do. And, and that's part of the diversity of the beauty of the church. And you know, we've already done two episodes, our first two episodes run intentional community and communal living issues. And, you know, very much kind of related to the kind of your community, you know, in similar ways. But I had some people right into the podcast after listening to Meg and Melinda talk about their communities. And they didn't understand really the difference between simply having roommates and living in some kind of community with a covenant, you know, like that they were talking. They couldn't understand. So they just have roommates. Sure. And so can you share a little bit about like the differences and similarities of where you see that like where is it the same as hey I have roommates and where is it different from it? Yeah. I think the differences are in the depth of commitment and the link of commitment. Let me talk about the like the depth first. Yeah. So I had had roommates that I enjoyed, fellowship with that I grabbed dinner with that we all read, bond hoppers, life together. And then the next four nights we all prayed together every night before we was dead. And then the fifth night someone had something to go to and the rest of us were tired and then by the sixth night we also were got to be the submitment. So I think so there was beautiful things about that and it didn't last or it wasn't a deep but in the national family of brothers we have rhythms that we have committed to doing. And because it's not just a kind of informal over roommate, so let's do this with each other but it's a in order to be a part of this family. This is what we do and it's more formalized. I mean and I'm only back up for this for a second. All married people do this. They have a rule of life and unspoken rule of life but they have a rule of life under which their family operate. The only difference is when you try to put together even with two like adults in a house you're going to have some tensions we're going to have some disagreement about what our family rule is. You put more than two adults in a house you put 10 males or females or male and female in adult males in a house and you need kind of a little more clearer agreement about what exactly our economy is going to look like in order to do that efficiently. So in the national family brothers we have a daily prayer, weekly confession and accountability, a monthly prayer and worship gathering and a chemical gathering on Saturday night to welcome the Sabbath. We do we have a schedule for what holidays we're going to do together. We have a schedule for what vacation we're going to do together. We have a commitment to a shared mission work in our city and so that's really different than my experiences I really had roommates or had roommates or Christians and we did some Christian things together but this is a lot more formalized and then because we seek to be family we're moving from merely being rugged individuals who happens to live together for our of a long as communion and instead we're trying to become a family which means becoming dependent on each other in healthy ways which I think also brings me to the other difference between kind of my roommate situation versus intentional Christian community or or even a monastery and that's the link of the commitment and I personally think this is even more important. The healthiest monastery historically have been one one that included vows of stability which are basically vows of your my family and I'm staying and we see how that's obviously healthier in marriage. When they say that's just a pride that's not too different when it comes to a family of fellow people. So yeah I mean for most roommates like you're only guaranteed until the end of your lease or even then the person could leave in sublet someone else but in the national family of brothers we eventually make lifetime commitments to be family for each other and this makes a huge difference. We talked earlier about you know if there's family in God's family in the Trinity and there's family between Christ and the Church then then I think and particularly for those out there who are angle can eat the North of the North of the Catholic they're going to get it but but but even for all the family is it's supposed to be a sacrament. It's supposed to be this ordinary thing that helps us understand something deeply mysterious and beautiful. So I think our human experience of family is supposed to help us better understand the beauty of the love and God's family and the Trinity and that we've been invited into by Christ to work on the crop. And one of the things that's really important about that family right it's human family is just an image that's pointing back to the family and God's family God's family's permanent. Not love and God's family is perfectly faithful and never ending. And so it seems like for the sacrament of human family to be true for it to truly actually point back to the thing of points to it also needs to be permanent. And in some ways I wonder if we experience family that are broken at some level of our soul it tells us a lie that we the God's love made break. And I'm saying this and in some ways that are common to a lot of those of us who are we're a single later in life. I'm experienced the revolving door of friends having close friends and college and after college and learning to depend on them and healthy ways you know I remember having conversations with my my therapist and challenging me. God needs your intimacy and you can help the ways and and you know who do you have around you who can you can trust and how how can you ask for what you need. Those are right questions right but then they left they got a better job of the new city they got married and they they moved down down in another neighborhood and they were too busy. We had a disagreement and and because there was no commitment we were forced to work it out and I'll be honest my heart just can't take it anymore. I can't connect deeply with people and having that broken and in some ways I'm got some great people around me right now in my life and I know technically they are loving you well my heart will not let me receive it. Unless I know they're going to be around. Unless I know this love is safe and what safety means we survive talking to my therapist. What safety means for my heart is I'm not going to come to depend on this in a healthy way and then the bottom fallout. And I think that look God made us for but he didn't make us to connect deeply with people and then for those those relationships those to be divorced whether that be narrower that friendship. But certainly not going to be with the new heaven and the new earth look like. So yeah so I really really strongly if this and and I think one that the one of the big different makers between nearly roommates versus an intentional Christian community of particularly a monastery and a historical sense is the the depth of the commitment to kind of daily rhythms and weekly rhythms you do together and a link of the commitment. Are we really committed to each other? Do we really have something similar to a valve to do? Or what we're calling it in our in the national family brother of the promise of family. So yeah so that's what we do. But I want to just I want to balance this a little bit with maybe clarifying also the ways we want it like a typical monastery. Our house is not our primary place of worship. We don't have jobs in the monastery we all have jobs out in the regular world some of them in secular jobs and the religious jobs and our home is not a place of isolation from our churches and friends. We actually require every guy in the national family brothers to be committed to the mission and the community of his local church. In the doors of our monastery always open to our extended friends and family and we're actually hoping that our monster ends up being the seed for a larger experience of a central Christian community of fellow but some very people in we've already got at least three parents and the kids who are seriously considering moving in in the same neighborhood as us and doing some some rhythms together as a bigger family. So yeah I think that clarification is helpful. Yeah what do our monster look like exactly? Absolutely and that's interesting because first of all before we get into that I want to say I totally understand about the heartbreak thing and the revolving door of friendship because it's hard as a self-adversion especially in a culture like the United States where there is no commitment there is no commitment of people being in your life and and it can get distrauding of like will these people be here in a few years you know and that's where we we have to have those people who are committed to do life with us for a lifetime you know we all need lifetime commitments and marriage cannot be the only solution for that need at all. Yeah and I want to sympathize with my married friends and I think it's some of the reasons why they all were afraid to invest too deeply at friendship. Absolutely. There you know married people need this just as much as seldom you need to know that our friendships will laugh. Yes and personal opinion is life long membership in a local church and living in the same community has historically been the way of the church did it and how we found stability in our friendships. It's a lot about that is very unamerican but in some ways what we're doing with the national family of brothers is just a life wrath maybe a life wrath until the second coming or hopefully a life wrath until the church and national actually starts to do what it was supposed to do and live how it was supposed to live. Exactly and I think that that also might be a whole reason why we see so many marriages fall apart is because we put too much pressure on what marriage is supposed to even fulfill the lives of married people that that's not your only source of committed community. If you're only committed community that's going to be in your life forever is the person you're married to. You are putting a lot of pressure on that one person. You need other even married people need other people that are committed to their lives now. You said that there are some families like parents with children who are thinking of moving into your neighborhood to kind of do some life rhythms with you guys but in your house I think the one thing that's interesting about your guys' life because you model it more after our monastery opposed to like Megan Melinda who we heard about in their intentional communities where it's made up of married people or single people together yours your community has a definition of is brought together by a definition of celibacy excluding dating and romance if I'm correct. So you can you share a little bit of why you wanted to bring this primarily celibate people together and I guess we've kind of a little bit talked on there but if we have you don't we can go on to another question but I thought that that was an interesting distinction. Right I think part of it is so many of us who are single-later in life have felt this sense that if if if we're in a relationship with someone but they are more deeply in a relationship with another person we feel some insecurity in our relationship and and that what we're feeling there is is scarcity right we're feeling the reality of the sector this world is broken and not enough is part of what it means to live in this world now and that that feeling sucks right but from a counseling perspective that feeling leaves our hearts to hesitate to step in fully and so I think why we feel like we particularly need a family of celibate men is that we need to know that we to to borrow a phrase that I think first meant from marriage but I think of the appropriate to kind of appropriate here in some ways we need to know that we are equally yokes to everyone else in our family and one of those about we don't want to feel left out like he's just from being left out right if if what God wants to invite us into into the that these inviting us into the trend of it into his family is to have belonging and to not be less than and to have a place and to never be left out then our family is need to model that as well and I think to be honest at some of the reasons why we go with the definition of celibacy that we have I mean that's historical that's what celibacy has meant for 2000 years of standing from not only section marriage but also dating a romance but it also keeps people from being left out because if we had guys in our monastery and I'm making clear we've got a mix of guys in our monastery and who are interested in an monastery who are gay who experience things like attraction and who don't but there's a mix of that going on but if there were two guys in our monastery who who were gay who developed kind of a more special romantic exclusive relationship with each other we're afraid that the result of that if enough pairing happen is some people get left out that's not what family should be yeah family doesn't leave people out and so not only is our definition of celibacy based on what it's meant historically and and what our scriptures see the pointy what celibacy means but also the practical consideration of if our goal is for people to have the longing and not be left out then pairing up is the enemy of that but yeah I get that that that makes that makes sense why then you know it would exclude dating in romance because of the type of community you're wanting to build and it would go it would just go against that very goal yeah but well I'd be clear as well that doesn't mean we're like living in fear of deep intimacy with each other like I think what family means is is the emotional intimacy and meaningful physical intimacy and meaningful spiritual intimacy it just means you're doing that with everybody you know it means just giving hugs to one guy in the family I'm giving hugs to everybody in the back exactly or whatever that healthy physical touch looks like so yeah mm-hmm absolutely so then you know in this community as you know as believers are our community what brings us together is Jesus you know obviously and our and our and our faith in Christ that's even in the first church that's the very thing that created those unique communities of Christians that bonded them together and it's the very same thing that you guys are trying to revive which I love and so how do you feel your community points you back to Jesus what do you say? Yeah it's also this is this is a really great great question because I guess I left out part of the story earlier for how how this part of how this monastery came about and what was happening around the same time in my life as I've discovered having friends having conversations with lots of my Christian friends I'm not alone in this experience that I've I've felt a lot of distance in in my personal relationship with Jesus for the past eight years it it it it doesn't seem to be how I was promised it would be the ways some of my friends describe a closeness to Jesus and experiencing intimacy with God that's been absent for a long time and we can they can have a lot longer discussion about what should our expectations be about intimacy with Jesus and what is healthy I'm really thankful for the past or my church Thomas McKinsey because that's I was going through that period of my life where where it was most pains when I had the least piece about this like distance he pointed me to St John the Cross and St Teresa of the Villa and there work on these and they seem to suggest that actually what is normal for most Christian is we kind of start our relationship with Jesus in a honeymoon phase where we we experience this closeness with Christ really easily but then God wants to mature our faith and part of what mature means is we we need to have off of sweet milk and and using a spiritual meat and what that often means for most people is a lifetime of feeling and a distance and then a few lucky of us get to get back to this kind of almost like you four or experience of union with Christ in the lifetime but most of us don't get that until the next life so you know I'll just say I'm literally all the Christians that I do life with when I ask them hey be honest with me like how was your relationship with Jesus like how do you what did you use to feel in that when you were in college or high school what do you feel now most people I know feel this distance and I'm I think the church would benefit from being honest about that yes for me one of the metaphors I've used is I felt like I was told to show up at this dates box with God and I showed up day after day for years and he never showed up that stood up and it's just too painful to go back to the dates box now that feeling suck and so in the midst of this I had with some in conversation with my pastor and he was sharing well how is it that we connect with God right and he said he said well communion the Eucharist is the way we connect with God but really in a metaphysical way he said he said it's not it's it's it's fine if you feel emotionally connected to Jesus through the Eucharist but that's not really the point and that's not that's not a promise so you know you probably you might not feel emotionally connected there other scripture is the way to feel connected to God but but he said but the scripture was written first for a people in the time in a place right and he can any can feel like it's not written specifically for you it can feel it can feel not as intimate the person of the particularly you've been in more kind of evangelical faces the Bible was used as the way that we ought to have a better relationship with Jesus you know you're not supposed to Jesus will read the Bible more the Bible has become the thing that reminds us that Jesus is at a distance because we're broken so that's sucky you know nature maybe is the way that God reveals his beauty to us again but again that body unique way it doesn't feel like it's uniquely for me yeah what is some other way I can't remember the others at this point oh worship was another but he's but the fifth one he he mentioned I can't remember the other two the fifth one he mentioned was but he said the body of Christ is maybe the primary way in the most common way that we're going to experience God through other Christians through other believers and anyways maybe you can imagine the body of Christ as a sacrament oh baptism was the other way that we could know but again that's also more menopysical the body of Christ is a sacrament it's an ordinary way that we come to know the mystery of God's love and for me that feels like the only way I'm going to reconnect with God is by experiencing this beauty in my love and relationship with other Christian that the only way I can understand how this is so good is that God is on the other side of that trying to like reach out to me through it and so this is a long limited way of saying how does this community point me back to Jesus I need family to convince me that God is exis and that he loves me and these men daily convinced me that God is real and he loves me like there's a way I hold on is family so yeah that really important to my life and I don't believe me that so much I saw some staff the other day about how single people were more likely to doubt that God exists and less likely to recover from from the doubt of of doubt so they're more likely to leave the faith because they doubt that God exists and that shouldn't be surprising to us if we understand that one of the primary ways that we experience God's love and that God proves to us that he is real is through the love we experience in church and to family but it's hard for people for single people to take hold of that so yeah so that's the you know a big reason why the national family of brothers is so important to me is that it is an experience of family that convinces me to God is real and he loves me. Um absolutely you know I think that's really important because you know there are many ways to connect with God and and I also love what you said about I think sometimes the church needs to get real about sometimes the uglyness of what it's like to be in relationship with Jesus and what I mean uglyness I mean that sometimes it just doesn't look like sunshine and flowers all the time and it doesn't look like you're on a honeymoon you know that it gets difficult and there's times of yelling at God and there's times of not feeling close and and and many times those times can be long periods yeah so and and you know community is one of those constant things that can be pointing us back to Jesus so yeah that is really a great thing. If we're on it the songs are very different than the testimony of Congress new conference. Um conversion is beautiful and hearing early testimony is our beautiful but I think there's a certain richness to the songs and what the songs ultimately is an honest testimony of David Faith and and ultimately Jesus praying through David that that by model something really honest and and rich and and complicated and painful yeah. Great absolutely thank you so much for for talking about all of this I think it's been really great before you know is there anything else that you would like to share before we go that we haven't covered so far. Um I mean one there's many people out there particularly dudes all the ladies as well I would love for some ladies to move to natural and supernatural family of sisters or start from businesses whenever can you're in or the ladies who listen to listening here are in but yeah if you're if you're a guy out there and and you think you might be called the cell to see or you need to say some sort of what you're called the cell to the fear marriage I have love to talk more to you. National may be a place for you to find that we we move cities often for for much less important things than finding family. So it shouldn't be odd to us that we might move cities for family. So yeah I'd be loved a grab we have a phone call with with anyone who would love to hear more about the national family brothers and what we're doing or if someone wants to start something similar in their city and I want to learn with us and want to collaborate on how we do this well. I think we need more of these things in our cities and in our churches and maybe that's the last thing I'll say is this life is painful. It's an everybody's life is painful but but it but it our churches have I think just organically become optimized for marriages and for nuclear families and so it's it's maybe even in some additional white hard for single Christian and I think there's definitely times when I'm tempted to say cell to see is just a cult of suffering or the sake of being righteous and it is not. I don't think that was ever God's intention for single is for the sake of the kingdom. It was you're just going to be lonely here but you'll please me with your your your sexual you're with your capacity and maybe you'll share the gospel with a couple extra people and so I just urge anyone out there who's who's single to don't give up hoping for more your life can be thriving and deeply beautiful and satisfying it's possible you're going to have to probably build it for yourself it's going to be hard but you can do it I mean this national family brothers didn't exist three years ago and it's not because any of us here in natural are superhuman and anyway we just said we can't settle for less than beautiful in this life which is us and we have to do it together we looked back in the past to see how cell people have done it before and then we tried to go imagine it for a new time so I would encourage everybody out there listening who needs something similar to go go do it go make it first of all I am stealing that phrase we won't settle for less than beautiful yes absolutely for everyone listening has Peter said I'm going to have his contact information in the episode description if you're interested in learning more about the Nashville family of brothers you'll be able to contact him through there or if you just want to talk to him about what it was like to start a community if you want to start one in your own community there would be great so all of that information will be in the episode description and thank you again so much Peter really enjoyed all of this talking with you and I just have enjoyed getting to know you a little bit more over the past two months yeah it's been fun yes I mean me and the other guys here the National Family brothers were we're definitely honored to be able to share share this and yeah so oh at least sometime I can get up to Nashville and hang out yeah it'll be cool I mean we've had some fun ideas from some of the brothers here about what our home is going to be like eventually and what some of our rhythms are going to be so I hope it's I hope eventually it will come to places vacation and retreat for lots of our friends across the the US and farther yeah yes yes all right well thank you everyone for listening really appreciate it be on the lookout for our next episode we will continue this conversation on friendship and be sure again wherever you listen to also just give a review to the podcast the reviews that you give help the podcast get more visibility so that more people can see it this has been really important we've had a few people who had never even learned about side be had never learned about celibacy or mixed orientation marriage or before they learned about it through this podcast so be sure to give a review and be able to help more people find this so we can continue this conversation on faith and sexuality and gender also if you like the intro music from this episode it comes from the song Wenders Love of the new EP called Traveler Song by the band Murphy DX they're great I've been listening to this EP like all week and love it so check it out on Spotify or Apple music or wherever you listen to your music it's great so thank you everyone have a great week and we'll talk to you soon
