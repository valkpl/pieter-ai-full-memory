 I don't think it's enough to just teach a historic sexual ethic. I think our church has got to embody it in ways that lead to good and beautiful thriving for gay people. So that's what we've got to do. We've got to invite them to be a part of a community of believers that is more satisfying they can be found anywhere else and invite them to come on mission with us to redeem the world in ways that are more compelling than anywhere else. Hello friends, welcome to this week's episode here on the Canadian Church Leaders podcast. I'm Jaden and if this is your first time tuning in here, it is my joy to welcome you. The heart of this podcast is simple. We just want to create a space for pastors to come to to consider the important matters of their hearts and souls to be drawn deeper into Jesus and what he's inviting pastors into and to hear the story that's unfolding in the church across Canada. Now typically we interview pastors on the podcast but today in order to lean into an important subject that we know pastors like yourself are asking a lot of questions about. We decided to have on Peter Volk. Peter is the director of a quip, a Nashville-based consulting ministry that partners with churches to begin places where LGBT-plus people can belong and thrive according to an orthodox Christian sexual ethic. Peter holds his masters in clinical mental health counseling and along that path he made pit stops at places like Gordon Conwall theological seminary to focus on lay leadership and culture making. As a fellow of the Boston Fellows Program, Peter also worked as a Ministry Development Intern and completed a 26-week pastoral counseling course on relational and sexual brokenness. His price, who is a friend as they say of the podcast, hosted this conversation with Peter and together they delved into Peter's story of growing up with what he personally calls enduring same-sex attraction and how that impacted his own faith and his experience of the church. The two of them also discuss a revisionist versus a historical sexual ethic and why Peter has chosen to identify with and live into the latter. In such a helpful way, Peter seeks to equip pastors for the important work of loving the LGBT-plus community by sharing what he wished he heard from pastors growing up, expressing the wounds that can be inflicted in the closet and the necessity of talking about vocational singleness in faith communities. Peter is humble, he's honest and articulate from the very beginning to the end of this conversation and throughout his heart to help bridge the gap that often exists between the church and the LGBT-plus community is abundantly clear. Now before we go into the interview, we just want to name that any time a conversation like this is hosted, there are going to be points of alignment and agreement and points of divergence and disagreement. But we wanted to host and release this conversation nonetheless because we know that many of you are asking real questions, not just around the theology of marriage, singleness and sexual equality, though that all matters, but also how you can more deeply live into love and service as a community. And we trust that hearing Peter's story and his own insights will be helpful for that and will at least be a launching pad for deeper reflection and conversations for you and your teams. So with all that said, here's a word from our friends at Generis, then we'll head right in with Chris and Peter. We want to take a quick moment to thank Generis for partnering with us to make today's episode possible. Generis exists to help church leaders like yourself. We've a culture of generosity into the fabric of your church. Now we know any conversation about fundraising can feel awkward or tricky, but they don't have to. Generosity is essential to the mission of God in our churches. And Generis is all about coming alongside pastors to help foster healthy cultures of generosity, so our churches can step into the mission God has for us. And here's how they do it. They take the time to understand the unique culture and story of your church. Then they take biblical principles and other proven strategies to build a tailored plan designed for your community. If you want to find out more, we want to introduce you to John Wright from their team. He was a pastor for many years and now he's giving his time working with Generis and local churches. You can find John's email in the show notes of this episode. Well Hi Peter, it's great to have you on the podcast. Thanks for being here. Yeah, hey Chris, thanks for having me. It's nice to we've talked on the phone before, but it's nice to actually see your face over zoom and have the conversation this way. Yeah, I'm partial to phone calls, so maybe that's why we have it in there having a zoom or face time yet, but really excited to engage in this conversation with video and getting to see all of the expressions. Exactly. We get to meet in person one day. I believe we will. A lot of people listening wouldn't know your story. And so I think that's a really helpful place to start just telling us who you are, how you came to faith, what your journey's been like, where it's led you today and just give space for that. So why don't you tell us a bit about yourself? Yeah, so each of my jobs has to do with sexuality and finding belonging in the body of Christ because I'm a Christian. I'm gay, I experience enduring same sex attractions and I'm committed to a historic sexual ethic. And for the sake of clarity, you know, here's what I mean when I say a historic sexual ethic. And I believe that God's best for every Christian is either what I call vocational singleness, which is a lifetime vocation of abstinence, singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention or Christian marriage, which Christians have historically understood to be a lifetime vocation of opposite sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom. So yeah, it's been a journey to get to, you know, those convictions and to find my way with the Lord, with these enduring attractions. I grew up hearing that gay people were bad, and dirty, and disgusting, particularly in the context of like political gay marriage debates in the Southeast for the United States. And then when the topic, you know, rarely came up in church. It was a simple statement that God is against homosexuality. I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior at age 10, and then two years later when my friends started going through puberty and noticing women's bodies to my, you know, terror really. I realized that I was instead, I instead found men physically attractive. And I was terrified because I didn't want to be bad dirty and disgusting, but that was what, you know, I grew up fearing the gay people were being taught the gay people were. So I was, you know, ashamed of this part of myself. And I was afraid that other people would find out and treat me poorly because of that. So I spent then like the next decade, you know, between ages 13 and 23, trying to become straight. You know, I prayed thousands of prayers that God would heal my homosexuality. I went to a hundred plus hours of counseling with therapists who said they could change my sexual orientation. I actually spent nine months with a pray the gay away in ministry. And I'm still gay. Like, you know, nothing changed about my, my same sex attractions. Nothing changed about my, my sexual orientation. I also felt super alone. I didn't think I belonged with gay people. But then on the other side, all of the Christians that I knew were straight or so I thought. So I was led to believe that in order to be a good Christian, I had to be straight. But, but I wasn't. Right. I felt like I was kind of stuck in no man's land like I didn't belong anywhere. And I was alone. So that that loneliness. Yeah, that was really tough. Really. What was it like? Because eventually there must have been a point where you came out to keep people in your life. Maybe Christians, you knew friends you'd journey with. What was that experience like for you within the church? Scary. I mean, I, I first shared with the first people I shared with were my parents. And it was because I was experiencing some really, really like debilitating shame. And I had to tell someone. And they didn't know how to help me any more than I knew how to help myself. But at least I was, I, I, I, I told someone. Why, I wasn't completely alone in this anymore. And it's been kind of a mixed bag. I mean, like throughout college, I was really involved in a campus ministry. And I shared that in that context about my sexuality, a little bit at first, I'm increasing me throughout those years. And I followed every instruction of my mentor and led Bible studies and represented the organization to the university and plan recruitment efforts. And I was given every reason to believe that like I could join that campus ministry staff after college if I wanted to. And then without warning, I was told not to apply to go on staff with that campus or with that campus ministry at any university. And the only explanation I was given was we don't know what to do with you and your attractions. So that was painful, you know. But in contrast to that, a lot of people responded really with, like with love and compassion to my story when I shared, I think the most, one of the most powerful moments that I would say, the moment when I kind of came out to a critical mass of people for the first time and felt kind of out afterward, was during my soft, more year of college, there was a gay brother in the Christian fraternity. I was a part of that had been confronted about having sex with his boyfriend and then he left our fraternity. And some of the guys in our fraternity responded kind of poorly to that. And didn't know how to have conversation about that well and with nuance. So I took the scary step of sharing my story with the entire fraternity. Because I wanted brothers who were straight to know how to better love people like me. And I wanted brothers who were gay to know that they weren't alone. And after I shared, you know, my fear of being shown turned to like joyful surprise as brother after brother lined up to give me a hug and open their phone. And you know, ask me to, hey, can we get coffee? I want to hear more about your story. I want to ask you questions. I want to get to know you better. And in some ways, those men embodied, you know, Christ for me, but that are the any church has or at least certainly in the earlier stages of my life. Like I feel like in that fraternity is where I met Jesus most powerfully. And in many ways, that positive experience was the beginning to like all the work I do today. Because after sharing with my fraternity over the next six months, they were like 10 or 15 guys in our Christian fraternity who, you know, one on one shared with me that they were also gay. And they also were committed to a traditional sexual ethic. And I was often the first person they had shared with. So we all started kind of doing life together. And I realized that all of us, the two things were true of all of us. One, we were all afraid that if we followed the Bible's wisdom that we would be alone. And in second, none of us had pastors or parents who knew how to help us, who knew what to do with this. So by my senior year in college, although I had gotten into medical school, I couldn't shake the feeling that God instead wanted me to go into full-time ministry, helping churches better love gay people like me. And so I got my masters in counseling so that I could better provide one on one pastoral care to people like me within during same-sex attractions. And then I started a quip in 2014 with a mission of equipping parents and pastors to better love and serve gay people according to a historic sexual ethic. And then I started the National Family of Brothers, which is the intentional Christian community that I live in. I started that in 2018 to offer a little bit of men like me, lifelong lived in family. So yeah, life-alcohol beginnings. But God really was faithful to redeem this enduring brokenness to make something of this enduring brokenness in my life that I hope brings glory to him and it's certainly brought a lot of goodness to my life. Right. I love to talk more about equipped in the work you're doing, but just going back a bit in the story. I mean, there's a couple of things, there's a lot of things that are fascinating to me. But two things in particular stood out to me. One, you experience some hurt when you shared with people from the church. And it's common, you know, in our day people get hurt by the church. They leave the church. Yet you're, you know, you started a ministry to help serve bless and encourage the church. And so I'm just curious about that turned in your heart if you could go deeper into that. And then the second thing in whatever order would be, how did you come to hold a traditional historic Christian sex ethic? And why stick to that? Given the fear of loneliness, the fear you heard shared by those other guys who came out to you? Yeah. So I wish I could say that, well, I wish I had found a lot of support within my church, you know, from campus ministers, from different people and to help me along the way. But for most of my story, it's felt like it's just kind of me and God figuring it out. And a lot of times I didn't feel like enough. And I honestly don't know how I like hung on other than to say it's kind of been a miracle, which in in in in in in in in in some ways is should be a cause for praise for believers obviously. But it's also sad because like we can't depend on miracles. And so when I think about my peers, many of whom didn't hang on to faith. And when I think about, you know, I don't know my my God son in in the church that I attend, who's who just that is fourth birthday party this past Sunday. Like if one day he wakes up and he realizes this is a part of his story, I don't want, I love that kid. I don't want us depending on a miracle that hangs onto his faith. We need something more robust than that. We need something more dependable, more consistent than that. And and the church can can offer much better than that. But beyond kind of just being being a miracle like particularly how did I hang on to a traditional sexual ethic. I'd say for better for worse, I grew up in an environment where a kind of historic sexual ethic or at least some version of like a conservative interpretation of scripture was just the default. And alternatives weren't just weren't considered like plausible. Or and I didn't even hear about them until I wasn't college. Now the way that I was taught to interpret the scriptures in a conservative way also had a lot of problematic things baked into it that caused other harms. But in some ways I was kind of intellectually shielded from at least progressive alternatives until later in life when I could think more critically about them. But yeah when I got to college I started interacting with you know thinking Christians of a variety of perspectives on this topic. And you know I'd say I don't know how much this has to do with just my personality and how God made me or or again just like the Holy Spirit really attending to me carefully. But I've always had this gut feeling that like if I arrived at and then kind of held on to a progressive sexual ethic or a revisionist sexual ethic it would have to be because I was really really convinced of it. Like I knew I couldn't just trick myself into thinking it was more true and the Matt Stick for months or or years. So you know I I mean to be honest I hoped that if I engaged with the most convincing arguments for a revisionist sexual ethic that I would finally thoroughly convincing or that I would at least find it more convincing than the arguments for a historic sexual ethic so that I could adopt that with with integrity and with peace. Like I would I would rather of that been true just to be honest every time I I wrestled with these questions with intellectual honesty I just couldn't help but come to the conclusion that the evidence for a revisionist sexual ethic was just super lacking. For particularly if I believe there is a God if I believe that God knows what's best for me better than I do and if I believe we know what that God's best is for us by reading the scriptures with his church historic. Then I just you know it was an unavoidable conclusion like a historic sexual ethic was true even if I wished it wasn't. Okay and so then for me it was kind of moving on to then well if this is true then how do I make this good and that's a whole other conversation. Right but yeah some combination of of the of the of the Holy Spirit being really faithful and maybe God putting me together as someone who like I really needed to be convinced intellectually in a rigorous way that it was true if I was going to hold something and I and I I just could never find an argument for a revisionist sexual ethic that was really like intellectually compelling. Emotionally compelling? Yeah absolutely but for something to be true you know it has has to be true and not just feel good. Right so I'm imagining like your your a game and you hold to a traditional sexual ethic that's got to be confusing for a lot of people and pretty isolating for you because I don't know if culture understands it or supports it I don't know if conservative churches necessarily understand it and then progressive churches I'm not sure they do either so you talked a bit about loneliness and I can imagine that feeling quite isolating and lonely and you also talked about you know even when you came out to people who were you know gracious and kind they didn't know what to do so you started equipped and when you were starting it you know to serve the church to help the church better love and serve I gave people what looking back like what would you have loved to have heard or what would have you know encouraged you what kind of support would you have wished for that maybe you didn't get yeah when I think about you know rewriting my story or imagining a better story for yeah my godson or for kind of next generations in the church um I wish instead of hearing like silence or like Loki homophobia in in my home or church around TV I would have heard a nuanced story about how God made all of us for family how we're all broken how that broken dismanifelstit self and some of us in the form of same six attractions um that the people don't choose who they're attracted to the God isn't surprised um I wish I would have heard from you know um them an invite to share with them as soon as I noticed anything broken about my sexuality including same sex attractions but anything else um I wish I would have heard them reassure me that if same sex attractions were a part of my story that there'd be nothing for me to be ashamed about that the God and my parents would still love me that they wouldn't try to make me straight that they would do whatever they could to support me and help me enjoy the best things God has to offer um I wish as soon as I started noticing that I was attracted to God's I would have shared with my parents because I would have known that they were safe I wish my parents and pastors like could have slowly walked me through all of the theological questions and philosophical questions and emotional questions about like why am I the way I am and and and what part of God play in all this and and why won't God change it and what does that mean for my life going forward and what then is God's best for me and and and and how do I trust that this is actually going to be good um you know I could have avoided all of that shame and anxiety and self hate and hiding and false hope of sexual orientation change and self destructive habits with lust I wish the churches that our family attended would have equipped my parents to have these conversations with me before puberty I wish the churches our family attended would have equipped my parents to respond better when I did share um I wish I would have grown up in churches where I heard people talk about Christian singleness and and where I saw healthy gay and straight people making public commitments to vocational singleness and leading in our church and thriving and and I wish I would have witnessed those vocational singles finding lifelong lived in you know intentional Christian community and and I wish someone would have taught about and and modeled how to meet our intimacy needs and something other than romance and sex and I wish I would have seen all of my peers considering vocational singleness just as seriously and and the vocational singleness didn't feel like a a consolation prize or or or double speak for like a curse of loneliness like I wish all of those things would have been there to give me hope that if I were called vocational singleness it could have been good for me because in many ways if all those things have been true like starting a quote but I'm going to completely unnecessary I would be doing something else maybe I'd be an architect I don't know you know but I wouldn't be in full-time ministry I bet or at least not in the way I am so I mean it's there's plenty other things that I wish would have been different farther down the road but in terms of support from my campus ministry in terms of kind of an eager response from the church when I first pitched the idea of equipped to some local churches but gosh if I had a magic wand it would have been even earlier in the story that that I would have made some things different right so early on when you're pitching a quick there was resistance and yet to just keep going believing in the vision for the ministry and the need of it based on your own experience and what you saw and all the I wish statements yeah I mean most churches this is certainly true eight years ago when we started a quick but it's still unfortunately true today and a lot of churches the churches that are willing to talk about these topics they usually have extreme views they either have kind of fairly progressive revisionist sexual ethics and so if you're not on more with that they think you're wasting your time and or they have kind of more culturally conservative fundamentalists pray the gay away theology on these topics they also were an interested in what equipped to offer and then most the other churches kind of in between those two extremes were silent and just terrified of this conversation and just hoping they could kick the can down the road and they could avoid this another six months and then reevaluate then so that's why I mean that's a lot of what a quick was met with at first you know their criticism from either extremes or or or strong hesitation and fear about talking about these topics from people who might be theologically like minded I mean that's what to me seems so difficult because it's almost like minority within a minority and there's not many safe spaces if you can't find safety in a progressive ethic or in a conservative place it seems to me that there's a growing need to create spaces where people who are part of the LGBTQ plus community but want to wrestle with the implications of a traditional sex ethic have a safe place to ask questions to wrestle and can step into a church environment where people understand that reality and I see you as helping the church step into that space which I think is really crucial what do you think about you know as you were talking about like brokenness and we all understand you know like our sexualities broken it's you know postfall and that manifests itself in different ways and you talked about like you know same sex attraction being an aspect of that brokenness and I imagine like like maybe it's because I'm influenced by culture but there's you know I'm sure that's probably what it is but there's something to me that's like oh that's how is that being heard by a gay person does that seem like it's dismissive of their experience or like what kind of resistance when you say stuff like that as a gay man like what kind of resistance do you get and then what's your response yeah so I I think going people have the strongest resistance to that it's either because they're what they're hearing me say or how they're reinterpreting my words is as if I were saying God made a mistake or that you the gay person are doing something wrong by still being gay it's one of those reinterpretations it is what I feel like I bump into the most and and I understand because there's been seasons where I've you know when I hear others say something similar or say those things that they they sting deep as well so I try to be you know patient first and then kind of maybe dig into like both of those misinterpretations you know first like like if I if I'm saying that that's I'm gay I haven't during same sex attractions and I'm saying that's broken and am I saying that then God made a mistake with me and that's and I'm not because I don't think I'm any of us are how God meant us to be I think when God first imagined each of us I mean before time before creation imagine just being perfect and born into a perfect world he imagined just a particular way but then when we started getting you know put together genetically in our in our in our mother's womb that was corrupted and broken and then when we were formed like bodily in our mother's womb formed imperfectly and then we were born into a broken world that injured us countless times before we ever gained the agency to sin ourselves and you know add insult to injury so like none of us are how God meant us to be as we are right now so how we are right now doesn't tell us anything about God's intentions and if we say then there's some parts of us that are broken and and and we wish it weren't that way we're not saying God made a mistake and we're not saying God loves me any less or God's got less of a plan for me or God can't use my imperfections or even my brokenness to tell a beautiful story of redemption which you're living into right now yeah and we all are invited into yeah God isn't surprised one bit and God isn't surprised about any of the ways any of us are broken God also doesn't look at us and say well you know I started with a good design but they've just screwed it up so I'll give up Mel and by they screwed it up I mean not individual people screen themselves up but like the grand conspiracy of sin the brokenness of all of creation that that does so much to injure us when God sees that he doesn't he doesn't throw up his hands in the air and say well like give up right he I mean he sent Jesus to start this work of redeeming and perfecting all of creation and that's our our destiny and you know that's not going to be complete until Jesus returns but even in the meantime Jesus said he sent his Holy Spirit to empower us to start bringing forth the kingdom now to start redeeming creation and getting closer to that new heavens and new earth now and and so sometimes that looks like our brokenness getting healed on this side of heaven sometimes that looks like God asking us to lean into our brokenness that never gets healed on this side of heaven but us leveraging it to connect with others of similar challenges and and loving on them so yeah I've seen that to be true in my life and I say really briefly to the person who here's me talk about the ways that this part of my story is broken and they hear me they hear a shame message of accusing them that they're done they're doing something wrong if they're still gay if they're still same sex attracted um I just want to make clear like people don't choose who they're attracted to I don't think there's any formula for changing people's attractions you know studies show that 96% of people who attempt sexual orientation change experience no change in their same sex attractions yet you know sexual orientation change attempts doubles the risk of suicide in those who attempt it and so it's harmful in effective and so I don't you know God I don't think God is asking me to to work harder or try harder to make myself straight I think God is asking me to bring my enduring brokenness to him and and him say I'm not surprised I still love you just as much as the first moment I imagined you let's let's let's do this together yeah I love that that's so good um thinking of younger people who might not even have the theological acumen to unpack it so beautifully like you just did there and who are very vulnerable you know who are in the process of identity formation perhaps in reaction to or in the context of their parents beliefs their religious upbringing and they realize their they're attracted to the same sex you know their story is similar to the story you share it about yourself and I know when you're work you know as a clinical psychologist or counselor you've talked a lot about the wounds of the closet and what that does to the psyche of a young person in church outside of church and I just wonder if you could share a bit more about that the wounds of the closet yeah so um on average there is a a five-year gap between when teens first notice same-sex attractions and when they first share with the parent or pastor about this part of their story and you know in in kind of popular culture that that period of time is referred to as the closet you know as as the the same sex attraction or gay person you know psychologically emotionally mentally going into a proverbial closet and locking the door and hiding this part of their story and when when kids do that particularly when the the children of believers do that what they're doing is they're going in that closet to make sense of this part of their story by themselves without the love and wisdom of their parents without the love and wisdom of God you know but what it does go in that closet within are the lies of the enemy the lies of culture and studies can certainly show what I've seen this in my own life and in the lives of the my counseling clients is that that closet breeds loneliness and anxiety and shame and depression and sexual sin and addiction and abandoning God's wisdom and suicidality and loss of faith like all of those things you know we know the gay teens are five times more likely to attempt suicides in their straight peers we know that 54% of gay people who grew up in the church of left the church so you know and and I'll say from my work as a licensed professional counselor like these those wounds of the closet I just described that loneliness anxiety shame depression sexual sin etc. those end up becoming I think the greatest barrier to gay Christians thriving according to a historic sexual ethic like those things are probably going to like haunt me for a lifetime and I see that they haunt my peers still like they're still working on trying to undo all of that harm done while they were in the closet for five plus years. yeah you talk about the depression of the closet the loneliness of the closet I think what the insecurity of the closet you know this thought this persistent thought if they knew this about me they wouldn't love me and the deep insecurity that bursts in someone's heart and the barrier becomes to even understand the love of God so I'm wondering you know given that reality how do we there's a lot of pastors listening who would be concerned about this as well and so I think a natural fault question is how do we create the types of environments where kids aren't afraid to come out where they know they can come out of the proverbial closet and be met with embrace. yeah I think one of the the best ways I mean and this I don't want to even just limit this to kids I mean I think more a bigger claim one of the best ways we can care for gay people in our churches is to make sure kids never go into the closet is to make sure kids never experience any of those wounds with the closet by sharing with parents as soon as they notice same-sex attractions and in doing so protecting them from those wounds keeping those wounds from ever happening and and I think that could lead to like a lifetime of thriving according to God's wisdom but for kids to share early about their sexuality parents are going to need coaching and encouragement to teach their kids about God's love and wisdom for gay people in age or appropriate ways before puberty so that whenever it is that some of those kids notice that this is the part of their story they've already heard their parents talk about this they've already know about God's love and wisdom they've already seen their parents demonstrate that they are safe to reassure them that if this is a part of your story please share with us it's not your fault there's nothing for you to be ashamed of we're going to make sense of this together God has got good and beautiful plans for you still that's what's necessary so parents are going to have to muster up the courage to have the sex talk but broaden it out and it's not just one awkward conversation it's many over time and they're going to have to include that piece that you just shared right there but then there's also the wider church conversation yeah and I think I mean it's I think most parents if you share that kind of ideal or vision or hope within they'd say that sounds great how do I do that like someone needs to teach me how to have those conversations with my kids like I'm terrified for many parents that resistance I hear is well I'm afraid to say the wrong thing too early and so they just delay and delay and delay until it's too late so you know those parents are going to need their churches to teach them how to have those conversations and but that's going to involve some risks on behalf of churches I mean you know yeah to those those listening of most of y'all are pastors I'm sure you can imagine if you went to the parents and your church and you said hey I want to equip you to have conversations with your kids ages two through ten in age appropriate ways about God's love and wisdom for everyone's sexual stewardship including God's love and wisdom for gay people you'd have a lot of parents who might freak out a little bit and who might be afraid and think you're kind of pushing them to have those conversations to to early or just you can imagine how time consuming that kind of a project would be to equip parents to have those conversations but I think it's super worth it I mean I hope you notice something that like in all everything I'm sharing about LGBT plus ministry that when you think about LGBT plus ministry there's important work to do reaching out to adult LGBT plus non-Christians but that's not the first work that I think you should do and and there's important work that you about reaching out to adult LGBT plus Christians who hold a revision as sexual ethic but I don't think that's the first work you should do and there's important work supporting adult LGBT plus Christians who hold a historic sexual ethic like me but I also don't think that's the first work you should do because the wounds of the closet have already injured all of those LGBT plus people that I have already listed God still has good and beautiful plans for them despite the wounds that they have endured despite the wounds that I have endured but those wounds are going to haunt me and haunt us for a lifetime but there is a group of LGBT plus people in your church who haven't gained those wounds yet who can be protected from the wounds of the closet and there are those kids you know they are the three to five year olds sitting in your church on Sunday some of whom will realize in five years that they're attracted to people of the same sex or experience gender incongruence what you say next week and over the next five years has the potential to either scare them into the closet and into the arms of the enemy or or reassured them that their parents and their church are safe and that God has good and beautiful plans for them leading to a lifetime of thriving so when you think about LGBT plus ministry I encourage you to first think about equipping parents to lead their kids ages two through twelve and age appropriate conversation about God honoring sexual stewardship including God's love and wisdom for gay people like if you can only do one thing to care for gay people if you're wondering what one thing you can do to have the greatest impact positive impact on gay people it's protecting kids from the wounds of the closet and setting them up for a lifetime of thriving according to God's wisdom that's so good such strong words and it's one of the gifts of having you on you know because I know a quick is doing that you're wanting to be a resource for pastors and for parents and obviously in the show notes there's going to be a link to your website and you come up and do trainings as well at churches and it is a real gift um I do want to ask you this question you've talked a lot about thriving according to God's wisdom around sexuality and we're kind of talking about the traditional sex ethic and it's just hard you know it's I'm sure it's for listeners or you know people in culture like what are the options if I'm gay and I do the rest of and I decide I want to follow Jesus but I also decide you know what I'm submitting to the authority of scripture I think sex is for marriage between a man and a woman so I that's what I believe which is going to be a single niss or celibacy for me it just seems like a scary prospect am I going to be alone will I know love intimacy like we understand that like you know marriage doesn't automatically equal intimacy nor does sex but it's hard to thrive you can't really thrive without deep relationship without intimacy without an experience of love and community and so I think the fear that even I have I don't know if other pastors would agree you know because I hold to the traditional ethic is that I'm somehow condemning someone to life of loneliness or I'm like is it you know is it God's best that I wonder if you could just help us with that a bit more yeah I think where we get stuck is we think it's easy for us to to to to see this as a sexual orientation problem or as a challenge that gay people trying to follow a historic sexual ethic face unique but I want to broaden out and say I think this is a vocational single niss challenge because I think you know the widows and divorces I know are facing the same question who believe they might be single for the rest of their life a number of single adult women in our church you maybe would prefer to marry but can't find anyone to marry they're facing the same question and others I mean it's really a question of can anyone find real life giving family and the body of Christ without romance and sex that's the question and it's not just unique to to gay people but I think in that highlights what the solution is right well well first the question is to ask like do we really believe do well do we believe the Bible teaches about a kind of singleness for the sake of the kingdom that will also involve just as much human intimacy in the context of the body of Christ I think the answer to that is yes you know so then the second question if we think the answer that is yes is well then how do we do that has there ever been a time in the church when the church has done that well and there is a time in the church the church has done that well particularly in the second third fourth fifth century of the church before this whole desert monks and cloistered monastery staying the most common you know understanding and expression of Jesus's words in Matthew 19 and Paul's words in 1st Corinthians 7 was a more of a kind of like an an urban monk or a city celibate that lived in you know amongst married people in their community and we're still a part of their local churches and and we're still a part of kind of the the economy of the of of the city and they they made permanent commitments to celibacy and they lived in kind of small clusters with other people committed to celibacy and they leveraged kind of their availability in singleness to serve their city and to serve their churches and they were they were they were honored and valued by their churches and they were integrated deeply into the community and their churches and and they had you know intimacy they had companionship in non-sexual non-romantic ways so we've got a vision of that I mean we've got a vision of an inscripture we've got an even kind of maybe more teased out vision of it from the early church I think we can reclaim that I can only can retrieve that I think we can restore that and I think that's the biggest credibility gap one or at least one of them the biggest credit ability gap when it comes to inviting gay people to consider celibacy is they say well is celibacy good for straight people and I think that's a great question let's make celibacy great for everyone who's caught into it gay or straight I think we we we get far by doing that right and you're I mean with the I don't want to say our Nashville brothers how does it come we up brothers Nashville family of brothers that's your own attempt to really do that and I wonder if you mentioned it but maybe tell us a bit more about that yeah so back in 2017 when I felt some clarity that I was called to vocational singleness to this kind of singleness that I believe Jesus is talking about a Matthew 19 and Paul's talking about in 1 Corinthians 7 I went to my pastor and I said hey I think I'm called to vocational singleness but I don't feel this like magical gift of celibacy that I don't need much human intimacy anymore like I feel like I need just as much human intimacy as the next person and I'm gonna find that at our church and he's surprisingly with his answer because he said well to be honest I don't think you're gonna you're going to find that at our church or at any church in Nashville any time soon and he can speak up when on this with authority because while he was not celibate he was deeply connected to this this monastery out where we're Anglicans connected to this monastery out in the southwest of the US and had friends there who were celibate for a lifetime so he knew what celibate men needed to be faithful for a lifetime but he followed that up and he said but monasticism has been the most common way that celibate people have found family in the church over the past 2000 years and then he said and monasticism has been the greatest source of theology in the church and it's been the greatest source of evangelism in the church and it's been the greatest source of social justice in the church so he said I think you should go start some or try to create some modern, accessible ordinary kind of normal ish version of a monastery in our city and and build the family in the body of Christ that you need and then keep going to our church and teach our church how to do this better and and maybe by the time you die our church will have learned how to do family in the body of Christ well enough that something like the Nashville family brothers isn't necessary anymore and so we did in 2018 that's what we did we got started with that. I love that I really think it is a prophetic witness to the broader church about what the family of God could and should be for all people and I wonder too if I mean this dichotomy I'm going to give you is too simplistic but I do cut sometimes feel like culturally there's an idolatry around sex or pleasure and then in the church there's an idolatry around marriage and single people get crushed by those two competing idolatries and the way you're walking out your life and your vocation is a challenge to both of those idolatries is that you have any thoughts about that is that fair and I'll tweak it a little bit but I think you're you're on the right path so I actually think that the the false theology that Christians struggle with the most when it comes to sexuality though the biggest obstacle to following God's wisdom for sexual stewardship is the idol of romance. So I think in in Disney movies and Taylor Swift songs we we hear and see like this beautiful depiction of connection that will fulfill and satisfy us more than anything else can because it's exclusive and because it's special and because it's not just with anyone right like the idol of romance promises us that will be united with the person meant specifically for each of us who matches each of us perfectly and then because we're a good match it'll be easy and effortless and self-sustaining you know because it was the love that we're destined for and I think that's the magical lie of romance idolatry and then I think that false hope destroys every relationship we step into like it aduves every connection to fall short of that that effortless deeply satisfying Disney romance promise you know ultimately I think that idol of romance seems a promise us love belonging family pleasure escape from loneliness but a reality it just leads to to casual connection thought was contraception abortion, codependency adultery, divorce loneliness like all kinds of stuff and I think we're just as a enamored with romance idolatry in the church from an early age parents and pastors highlight Bible stories and holidays centering romance and marriage parents comment you know when you get married or ask are you dating anyone and they don't really leave any room for stories or celebrations of single lists for the sake of Christ kingdom I think Christian teens assume that they are free to indulge in romance as much as they want as long as they just don't cross certain lines and at least here at a quick when we survey pastors 72% of them have said quote if a person desire or 72% of them have agreed with this statement quote if a person desires to marry and have kids then God wants them to marry and and I just think this is led to really painful results like half of Christian marriages in the divorce the same rate as every other marriage and a 2017 Barnas study found that single people struggle with more depression more anxiety more doubt in God's existence more difficulty rebounding from doubt so I think gay or straight false expectations about what romance can provide and then chasing that idol of romance like a like a mirage of an oasis in the desert I think that's at the core of the sexual brokenness we see and people regardless of sexual orientation right and I don't think this is new like I think it's a direct product of these sexual revolutions decoupling of sex and child raising and I know when someone brings up the sexual revolution and those kind of philosophical ideas that can feel like like you know headie talking points but I think the enemy like cleverly baked into the sexual revolution a rejection of the ideas that that God ordered the world that he and only he knows the best ways to enjoy his gifts that that he commands his people to faithfully steward their bodies both because it will be best for them long term and because he is the all-powerful God of the universe and if we should obey him instead I think like the enemy taught us through the sexual revolution that that the best gift is is sex and romance unshackled but from God's restraints. enjoyed whenever and however makes us feel most good in the short term that that we can date when we want and we can have sex when we want and we can have kids or not have kids when we want and we can get divorced when we want and we can identify how we want and we can change our bodies how we want like that's that's all what flows out of these important kind of ideas that just kind of seem to seep into our world as a result of the sexual revolution instead like God's best is is something a bit different. right so we're going to have to do work around like de-throning the idols the false gods of romance as pastors and then we're going to have to do work constructing a beautiful biblical vision of both marriage and single S yeah but what and I would say the third thing though is like not just a positive vision in an abstract way when it comes to marriage you want to see real married couples thriving and celebrate them and have them share their stories and but then you also want to see the same thing for single people in the church walking out their vocational singleness and we've obviously neglected that far too much and so that would be a correction we would have to make. I think so yeah and I think this work of teaching about and supporting vocational single as well and maybe this hope that we would have more and healthier Christian marriages in our churches arising timeless both of those boats. I don't think those things are like in competition. My favorite like GK Chesterton quote well my favorite quote and it's from GK Chesterton is that when the monks return so will marriage and what is getting at in that is that if our churches actually taught about the possibility of vocational singleness. Top that it was good supported it right modeled for kids growing up that it could be good so kids actually thought hey if I were called to that that would be a good thing and then if our churches invited every prepared every kid and then invited every Christian young adult to discern like to open handedly ask God which gift do you want to give me the gift of Christian marriage or the gift of vocational singleness and then we as believers stepped into whichever gift God was inviting us into and we embraced that for the right reasons and we saw both of those callings as callings to beautifully and and and sacrificially labor for the sake of the kingdom that would lead to more people committing to vocational singleness and more people committing to Christian marriage and walking it out faithfully. I think that's a big part of the solution and I think in a church when we're doing both of those things better it's a place where we have so much more credibility to invite gay people into considering a historical ethyl ethic because because vocational singleness is now plausible for those who feel call to it but but but gay people also see us taking all of the things that the Jesus and and the other authors of scripture say about godly marriage about Christian marriage seriously in ways that at least in the short term would seem pretty inconvenient for the straight people call to Christian marriage but is life giving right we'd have credibility because it seems like we're actually taking all of scripture seriously for our sexual stewardship leading to better fruit everywhere mm that's so good you are you a big chestured in fan yeah I like some of the stuff yeah do you have what's your favorite book of his well that I mean that favorite quote comes from a kind of funky piece of nonfiction he did or allegory that he did called the return of Don Kyoto so it's hard for me not to to name that as my favorite title right yeah so you know there's people we would know and love potentially listening to this podcast and they they may be gay they may be they're not but they they're frustrated they're like listen I understand that there are straight people and gay people who hold to a traditional ethic when it comes to sexuality and not just Christian people but Muslim people Jewish people lots of people all around the world and they're frustrated because they're like well it's great that Peter's on here but there's no one representing like a progressive sexual ethic and what would you say to that person yeah so I think that Christian should absolutely engage with the best arguments for a revisionist sexual ethic like like if a historic sexual ethic is true it should be able to stand up against and stand up to intellectual probing and questioning and and I think it does I think the evidence for revisionist sexual ethic pales in comparison to the evidence for a historic sexual ethic but but much more often than not I think our humans about sexual ethics are a distraction because they are so emotionally loaded that many find it actually difficult to discuss the ideas instead of devolving into into personal attacks and and I think the best arguments for a a a a a historic sexual ethic even sometimes feel kind of irrelevant because those who hold a revisionist sexual ethic would say well it's born out bad and ugly fruit and and they know in there in their gut that is something is even if they can't like put words to it they have this sense of like if something were true then it should be good and beautiful and these things aren't disconnecting so some things off here and and I want to honor that I don't think what's off is that a traditional sexual ethic or excuse me I had a historic sexual ethic is false I think it's that we haven't in embodied it accurately embodied it well and I and I think there's even worse fruit long term of a revisionist sexual ethic but but but for all those reasons kind of direct conversations about sexual ethics I think can be really emotionally loaded and emotionally charged I think it can be a distraction because disagreements about sexual ethics are rarely actually about sexual ethics I think most of the time when I disagree with someone about sexual ethics it's really because we disagree on one of three much more fundamental questions does God exist does that God know what's best for me better than I do and and do we know what that God's best is for me by reading the scriptures with the church historic rarely does someone say yes to each of those questions yet hold a revisionist sexual ethic and let's be honest our answer I think our answers to those three more fundamental questions are much more important than our opinions about sexual ethics so you know if you find yourself in conversation with someone who believes differently than you about sexual ethics instead of falling into the track of emotionally loaded arguments I've really suggest talking about these three much more important questions and you'll get much less bogged down in painful feelings when doing that but but I also want to end with maybe some suggestions for how we can win somely hold a historic sexual ethic around LGBT plus people who aren't Christians or who hold a revisionist sexual ethic so one I think we can be quick to confess the sense of the church you don't have to apologize for a historic sexual ethic but I think we should confess the ways that Christians have been complicit in in hate crimes over past the decades and propaganda and ex-gay theology that led millions of LGBT plus people to lose their faith we can we can name those things um I think it's important to honor gay people by offering clarity you know I think clarity is charity I think that obfuscating our beliefs actually hurts LGBT plus people if they then later learn that we're more conservative or more liberal than they expected and that can lead to feelings of betrayal and feeling betrayed by Jesus if Christians and Christian leaders often kind of represent or image Jesus for them in some way so I think instead speaking clearly and publicly about our communities convictions is is good policy it's it honors gay people um third I think churches can go ahead and get busy like taking practical steps like we've already explored how I don't think it's enough to just teach a historic sexual ethic I think our churches have got to embody it in ways that lead to good and beautiful thriving for gay people so seek training so that leaders in your congregation can provide better pastoral care uh commit to sharing with every kid about God's love and wisdom for gay people before puberty to prevent the wounds of the closet and and cultivate intentional Christian community in your church where singles can find permanent lived in family um I think a fourth thing we can do to kind of have more credibility in the eyes of LGBT plus non-Christians and LGBT plus Christians who hold a revisionist sexual ethic is to raise the bar for straight sexuality and and and straight accountability you know I think we need to make sure that straight Christians are genuinely discerning vocational singleness that it straight marriages uh the straight Christian marriages are faithfully open to the kingdom worker for raising children uh that that period couples take seriously the Bible's teachings about unbiblical divorce and remarriage I think these steps will eliminate kind of discriminatory application of God's inconvenient wisdom and prevent uh a victim mentality that a lot of LGBT plus people have because they because they see a double standard um I think we can do uh a lot to maybe help the gay Christians in our community who who share our historic sexual ethic to help them thrive um um you know before doing like outreach what about the people in your church how can you help them experience good fruits so more in the wounds of the closet with them offer theological clarity provide better pastoral care help them build permanent lived in family um and and then last but but not least um we've got to offer family and mission like nowhere else like why would an LGBT plus person convinced of a revisionist sexual ethic everyone would go to a church that affirms a historic sexual ethic only I think if your church is offering deeper family in the body of Christ and a greater opportunity to serve their wider community then those gay people can find anywhere else and I mean I think we can apply this question more generally like why would anyone want to be a part of a church that calls him or her to inconvenient stewardship of any kind unless that church is offering something so compelling so beautiful that individuals want to continue to be a part of that church despite aspects that they strongly agree with that's what we've got to do we've got to invite them to be a part of a community of believers that is more satisfying that can be found anywhere else and invite them to come on mission with us to redeem the world in ways that are more compelling than anywhere else so that's so helpful such strong words um and a great place to end actually but for those who are listening and if you're a pastor or leader you feel a little overwhelmed I mean that's what equipped exists for why don't you hit us with the website really quick I know it's going to be in the show notes as well but I want to give us that yeah equipped your community.org and yeah you're right Chris like this that is what I do for a living that's what our team does for a living we come alongside Christian leaders and we help them clarify their vision for this kind of ministry at their church get a careful strategy for kind of if we started down this road of doing this work what's the right steps to do it and what order it anticipate you know landmines and then we want to walk alongside you step for step in rolling out that strategy and and and and equipping leaders and educating everyday Christians and supporting parents and supporting kids and part of a bigger project of not just like how do we talk about LGBT plus topics but how do we talk about sexual stewardship for all people and then as a part of that what's God's loving wisdom for for gay people so yeah would love to be a resource however I can.
