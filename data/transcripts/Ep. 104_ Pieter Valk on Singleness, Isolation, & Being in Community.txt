Today I'm going to be interviewing Peter Volk and we have Al-Rigio's bio here in a little bit. We have a great conversation about community, about connection. I mentioned him at the beginning of the interview, a line that we often use and are beyond the battle alumni community and that is that the opposite of addiction is connection. We all need connection and honestly in our culture today it is really hard to find connection. Our culture is built to be isolated from our cell phones to the nine to five sort of commuter lifestyle. You know whatever your job, this is the idea that you go to work and then you drive somewhere else where you live and you lock the doors and you watch TV and you do YouTube and Netflix and it's just this very, very isolating lifestyle. Peter talks about the need to be weird which means culturally different in order to really experience community. He has a ton of expertise on what community looks like and creative ways especially for singles. I think that is really important because we're bad at finding community especially in the church but we're even worse when it comes to singles. I think it's really important that singles and married people and pastors listen to this interview. I think singles are going to find a ton of practical stuff. Mary people I think we need to do a better job of supporting the singles in our communities and in our churches and I've been really challenged of what I can do as a pastor and within my church as I think about ways of creating community for singles and for everyone. So if you go to my church and you're listening it's in the hopper so it's be praying as I try to think about yeah practical ways to do this. This is really important I think this man this there's so much stuff in here. Peter's also a counselor so we talk about mental health stuff and depression and how that relates to all of this so please please listen a couple quick things before we jump into the bio.

Peter, welcome to the flip side. Thanks so much for joining us. Yeah, I really glad to be here, Noah. Hey, just to start off, tell us about yourself and whatever you want to share and what you're up to in ministry. Yeah, so I wear a couple of different hats. I'm a licensed professional counselor. I help run a ministry called Equip that does training in coaching and consulting with churches. I do get to do a lot of public discipleship right articles for places like Christianity today in the orthodoxy and post interesting questions on social media and have a great conversation with some different people following me on this basis. I am in the process of becoming a ordained in the Anglican churches in North America. And then I'm also a one of two founding brothers of a basically a modern monastery. An ecumenically Christian intentional Christian community called the Nashville family of brothers. And we essentially are kind of building a place where men who feel called to Christian and who feel called to vocational singleness to singleness for the sake of King to work with undivided attention. We're building a place where in Nashville where those men can find life long lived in family. So yeah, lots of different hats I get to wear, but with those are some of them. And in many ways all of that is made possible because of of my call to vocational singleness. I feel like the Lord is called me to vocational singleness. I've committed to that he's given me that gift. And so there's all these cool different like human work projects that I get to be a part of because of my availability and vocational singleness. And I still need family. And so that that Nashville family brothers is where is where I call home. That's that's my family. Thank you. That's awesome. We're going to talk about I want to I want to learn more about the Nashville family of brothers. We're going to talk about that. And among other things I want to start with I'm looking forward to talking to you about community. I think you have a really unique. I don't want to say expertise, but you know, I think that's an appropriate word to use and in the sense of finding community, you know, outside of maybe the cultural stereotypical ways that we're given. You know, to find community. But so for me, I've been in my background is I have a book called Beyond the Battle and it's a book for men. The subtitle is finding your identity and Christ in an over-sexualized world. And so it's helping men overcome pornography, sexual sin, as well as finding contentment and their singleness and finding contentment in their marriages. And so if I've been doing this for six years, we have this huge, well, I want to say huge. I mean, it's a it's a very meaningful community of friends now that I have. We call it the alumni community. And we're just we're having these deep conversations regularly about and many of them are listening. Certainly we have we have listeners men and women listening from from beyond that as well. But one line that we use a lot is the opposite of addiction is connection and I didn't come up with that line. But it's just we found that to be so true that the guys that are staying connected. The guys that are in community. They're the ones that are thriving. They're the ones that are getting away from these from pornography. They're getting away from, you know, these addictive behaviors. And I had a couple thoughts on that. I just want to I want to get your I want to my question is going to be on just how you've experienced or witnessed when when people don't have community and connection. And and I think when I when I look at our culture, it seems like we're given these fake forms of community and pornography, a fake form of community and hookups. Other coping, you know, numbing sort of mechanisms. But then there's also the more acceptable coping mechanisms like YouTube and Netflix and kind of just locking your door and binge, you know, watching things, you know, all night sort of thing. I have found that the more myself and others, the guys, particularly that we're going really deep with. If we deprive ourselves from real connection and community. The more we're drawn to the fake form with porn or whatever it may be, right, because it gives you kind of that fake hit of community. But then the more you go to the fake form. The more you get into that rut and then the less likely you are to reach out into like this into real, you know, real community. So I would love to start with just kind of that concept of the opposite of addiction is connection. I'd love to hear your thoughts on, you know, how you've either experienced that personally or witnessed that. With the people, you know, sounds like mostly men that you're walking with. Because man, I just feel like it's a message that our culture, our Christian culture really needs to hear today. Yeah, that message, the opposite of addiction is connection sounds, sounds 100% true to me. I mean, my personal experience is been I am in sexual addiction recovery. And I've been at that for the past, like roughly decade. And I certainly seem to be seen that to be true in my own life. You know, any of these kind of things I'm tempted to reach out for as shortcuts are really just unsatisfying substitutes for the real thing. And the real thing is connection is healthy intimacy with my brothers and sisters in Christ and with Jesus. And kind of the best defense against those things is just to kind of go on offense and to go meet my intimacy needs and healthy ways. And then also in the context of those connections to be able to connect with my, my painful emotions. And and give them space and to work through them and to experience healing or at least just an audience around them. That makes a huge difference. And then in my practice as a licensed professional counselor actually often meet with clients who are making sense of similar struggles. And and that's what they've seen as well, you know, it's, you know, breaking the habit in erupting the habit with certain strategies and software can only do so much. If we're not meeting the real need for connection in a healthy way. Then we're not really going to get to the progress we want and the progress we want ultimately isn't not to do the bad things. It's to live a full life. Yeah. Right. Like it's it's just a not kind of effect that we're also going to be less interested in in some of these substitutes that the mess up with our life, right. Really what motivates me is I want fullness of life. I want connection. I want I want thriving flourishing relationships and then what I'm seeking those in healthy ways. You know, it's just easier to say no to the cheap substitutes because I kind of see them for what they are. So yeah, I think you're definitely right, you know, one reason why that's so difficult these days is because of, you know, these phones in particular they're just so well designed to to entertain us in cheap ways. But in shallow ways, but in ways that are easy to get used to. There was a book kicking out recently that was that was highlighting a plot case I like to listen to. And her book was just about like hanging out the lost art of hanging out or something like that. As you just talked about how when people didn't have these screens to constantly entertain them, they were they were used to sitting in a room with the people who happened to be in the home that they're in. And not having a plan for how to spend the time and then just spending the time together. And there's a certain anxiety that maybe would come up from having unplanned time with nothing to immediately distract yourself with. But people grew kind of muscles for that. Not only how to deal with kind of the maybe the discomfort of not having a plan, a tolerance for that, but also the muscles for how to just to discover your own entertainment. To make your own entertainment, to enjoy hanging out. And all these devices do is just is just you know kind of a atrophy or tolerance for that discomfort. Atrophy our muscles for just hanging out. Makes us dependent on them. And then I think as we probably get into later, particularly when we talk about like community is I think the other layer on top of these phones being so addicting is that our world. Is not built for community for married people or single people right in the ways that it was 200 years ago. Yeah, and beyond. And so it's kind of working at us from both directions our world is both built to isolate us and and makes us vulnerable to then these these these smartphones. That are perfectly designed to then meet us at that point and get us get us hooked on whatever the thing is we're using to fast forward through life. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and you're so right about our culture today and the culture we're in and I've thought about you know biblical the New Testament church culture the first century where they were meeting together daily the book of Acts tell us and you get the vibe that it's sort of a village culture where you're just you're seeing people all the time. You're you know, you're you're you're always in this this community together. Um, today it feels like to me this is just my quick observation. I think about when I was in college. I lived in a dorm I went to a Christian college and I experienced real community and that was a rare that was really one of the richest if not the richest time of my life when it came to community and brought me my sense of my sense of security really like it was just a really vibrant place. Um, but in our culture it seems like college dorms are like the only socially accepted place to experience that. Um, the other one would be marriage so okay, go get married and then you're going to experience that with one other person, which is not the same thing as as a life of community, but that's your other socially, you know, accepted place to live in community. And then I thought of a third one, which is the assisted living home. So then you know, you you you are you can't live on your own. More and so you're in nursing home assisted living home and and if you go to those places to volunteer or or whatnot, there's always activities going on. There's always things in the activity hall and there. You know, they're pushing you to go to the the elderly folks to go to those because of how necessary, right. That, um, that connection is so we switched over to the church. I'm a pastor and you know, especially for churches that believe in the the traditional sexual ethic as we do. And best case scenario in these churches, I know there's a spectrum best case scenario the church tells a gay or same sex attracted person who's also trying to live the traditional sexual ethic there we say. The best case scenario, it's not your attraction that to send it's not your orientation that to send it's the it's the behavior just and so I'm just widely kind of not showing summarizing that as much as I can. So here's your options, okay. You're going to look your options are a mixed orientation marriage, which certainly does not work for everybody. And maybe you know, I don't know this statistics on that, maybe only a select few or your option is single, celibacy, good luck and we'll see you next Sunday for Sunday morning church, right. And my second question is going to be about the church and what we can do, but my first question is how does a person and I want to just focus on singles for now this certainly applies to married folks as well, but singles of all stripes in the church, you know, gay, straight it it it it singleness is singleness and in the sense of we have the choice to be very isolated and that seems like what's hand into us by culture and even what's accepted right. Right, this is the most socially noble thing is to have your own apartment and you just you know you go home and you isolate how does a single person and married people be listening in here. How does a person find real community in today's day and age and culture. Yeah. Yeah. So I think one way to think about answer that question is to think about what's the time when it was working and what changed. Yeah. It's good. And I know it was working as soon as 200 years ago, but something changed and you know I think people can blame it on different things some people blame it on. You know, adultery of romance or adultery of marriage or they blame it on the sexual revolution or whatever whatever or smartphones. I really appreciate a book by Rodney Clath on this topic called family ad across roads or families at the crossroads. I can't remember exactly exact title, but something in that that range. What he pinpoints as the the where kind of robust community really started breaking down. In an unexamined way, which is why it's been so effective in some ways, right. It's not it's not the obvious culprit is the industrial revolution leading to a really booming middle class and people could afford to have their own home. Separated from other people and they could afford to move cities. And they never pause to ask whether that would be good for them to just because they could afford it. And he says that that's when it broke down. When we moved from a kind of a village lifestyle, a thick neighborhood lifestyle to people and multi family, multi generational homes and clusters of homes to people living in single family homes. And accessing the things they that were most optimized for them by driving, not by walking. And so then you could go to a church 15 minutes away and you could go to a school 15 minutes away and you could go to grocery store 15 minutes away and and basically your neighbors don't exist anymore. You don't you're not forced to interact with them. And any connection you have is 15 minutes away and doesn't occur naturally right I mean any of any people who are married or have kids. You know you in up spending so many minutes and hours with your kids and your spouse doing laundry. Cook and dinner. Putting the dishes up. Just sitting for those 15 minutes of transition time between dinner and starting to put kids to bed where it's kind of chaos, but you're in the same place. It's the small mundane things that require unavoidably shared space that leads to community. And if we're separated by single family homes you just never there's not enough scarcity there's not enough minutes in the day to plan intentional time with people and other single family homes to get your needs for community net. But just isn't. And then on top of that people lose cities right so people don't stay in the same place for their lifetime they move every five years for a job or whatever and so whatever little kind of community we stitch together across our single family homes we we throw away and rebuild every five years. So yeah I think married or single I don't think it's going to get that much better until we realize that's the problem. And we probably need to think about committing to the same house and the same neighborhood and the same church for the rest of our life. And be willing to be weird and be willing to pass on job opportunities. Yeah. And pass on lots of things in order to have the good life. And I love this book by. Daniel Groat. Broffy or growth called the power of place which is a really compelling book and he dabble a little bit of windowberry and dabble a little bit of the same Benedict and basically makes this argument that that all Christians are going to consider finding a place we're staying and then stay for the rest of your life. That's the key to kind of a fuller life. And he's getting that right so that's that's broadly I think the big barrier and and and so so in short I would say if you want more community married or single person you're going to be willing to be weird. You're going to be willing to reject. This system of single family homes move wherever you want drive to see your friends is not going to work if you try to make that work you're going to be lonely you know. You need to be able to be weird now what is exactly the solution for single people. I think it's interesting that you say that like oh the thing that kind of marriage assisted living and then college dorms. Is a thing that seemed to work for a lot of people when they were single college dorms. For turnities. They're just out of the rows of monasteries. Right. They're just there just little shadows of what was the first solution is always been the best solution for single people which is the monastery. And I think the solution is actually not to kind of is basically continue the college dorm for the rest of your life. Yeah. Essentially is to continue the for the for the fat house for the rest of your life I was in a Christian fraternity and it was that was like the source of community for me in college. And this came up in my own life right I you know. I'm primarily same sex attracted but was and was out in college about being gay but I was in a Christian fraternity that took girls to date events and so took some girls on date events low expectations because then you I was gay. And so I was in a time I ended up dating three of them falling love with two of them almost getting engaged to one of them and we broke up for reasons I'm related to my sexuality. But like I knew Christian marriage could work for me. I'd also thought a lot about what the Bible has to say about singles and so I knew both of these were kind of options for me. And the Holy Spirit just kind of made it clear to me that I was supposed to ask God if if he had a preference. To give me singleness for marriage. And so very long story short felt some clarity years later that God was calling me to vocational single list to the kind of single to spoke about in Matthew 19 and 1st Corinthians 7. But I knew it did not have some kind of like magical gift of celibacy that I didn't need community anymore so I went to my local pastor and I said. How am I going to find the kind of community I need family I need in our church to do vocational single as well. And he responded very honestly he said you're not going to. You're not going to find the kind of community you need at this church or any church in Nashville anytime soon. Maybe it's different grand Rapids I don't know I will speak for you. But that's what he said about Nashville. And then he said but. And I'm a narcissism and I go to an angle in church it's is not Catholic but you know we were more traditional in some ways. But he said he said Peter, monasticism has been the most common way that sell the people have found fame. And monasticism has been the greatest source of social justice in the church and monasticism has been the greatest source of theology in the church and monasticism has been the greatest source of evangelism in the church. So I think if you're going to stay in Nashville and there's not a monastery here yet for you. I think you should gather with some other men and you should start you should build a modern monastery. And and find build the family you need be weird and then stick around at our church for your lifetime and teach our church how to do family in the body of price better. And maybe by the time you die. Next generation of the sell the people at our church could find enough family in the body of price at our church that they wouldn't need a monastery. But you know if we look at the past 2000 years of Christian history the monastery has been necessary and we'll probably be necessary after you die. So that's the very long term days where my pastor gave us. And that's what also led to the National Family of Brothers I'm a part of but I think you know so you know we can't go back to 200 years ago. But the way our world is built is not for a community we're going to have to be willing to be weird to get the kind of community we need whether you're married or your single. And particularly for single people I think the kind of weird you're going to need is a monastery in some form in some fashion. You know we can call it an intentional Christian community. Whatever you want to call it but but I think that's what it's going to take. And I think living in a studio apartment and trying to connect with friends across the city and then moving for a group send moving cities every five years. That's that's just going to lead to loneliness. You know the cost of of loneliness the cost of freedom is loneliness. Yeah well I have a couple questions hopefully I don't cluster them all together that's when I know I said a lot of that podcast host when I do that. Okay so I want to I want to scale this I want to scale that monastery idea down because I think your average listeners like yo I ain't starting to monster I don't know you're talking about right like. Okay so. Take some ingredients of that right and I and I want to then apply this might be a separate question in the same question I'm sure but I'm picturing. The single person that's listening and they're going I don't feel that call to singleness I I really want to get married like they have whether they're they're straight or they're gay. But I you know they're just like I can't particularly I'm thinking to some straight singles that that I'm friends with you know that we're helping with this issue of connection and isolation. And they still think marriages the. You know marriages the is the be all end all marriages the thing like they must have it you know it's just secure their their validation and identity and all those things and you know there's. That's kind of where they're at like the idea of singleness terrifies them and they're I'm not choosing singleness it's not it doesn't feel like a gift to me you know those sorts of things and and single men and women both who are. I I feel like there's there's a this is culturally stereotypically you have a certain age where it's like okay you're in your 20s you can live in a house with some friends. And the cultures like good with that you have house made you rent rooms and as you get into maybe your 30s. 40s or I'm not sure that just seems less common it seems like that's less common with the people that I know the singles that I know and their 40s are living alone they're living in apartments by themselves. And so take some of the ingredients of what what you're doing the the the the components of the monastery life the intentional Christian community life and let's take the single man or woman who's in their apartment by themselves. And I think they're all these things right they're disconnected they're isolated and I'm saying like yo you need to get connected you know and I don't think they know how. And I think there's a level of defeatedness and probably depression that goes along with it of this rut their end of like I I don't even have the. I want that full life you're talking about but I don't have the get up and go to go to go make it happen into you know build it so this is probably multiple questions but let's just focus on. How do you how do you scale some of that or how can you take some of those ingredients to someone that's living alone in an apartment they're not going to. Join a monastery or start one but I like what you said about being weird they have to learn how to live weird weird meaning culture might look at what your your living situation isn't go that's weird. But in order to experience this type of community you know just just some ideas of what helps someone brainstorm what that could look like for their life. Yeah, so the the biggest barrier might be but I think the most important ingredient anyways is that you know we so we're as humans we're embodied right the the body. Our physical earth matters we're destined for a physical new heavens the new earth and resurrected bodies embodiment presence place matters go so so so so much. And it just cannot be replaced by by. Like I message prayer chains and face time hangouts it just can and so my first suggestion would be like find. To to three other people to move into a kind of a multi bedroom apartment thing together yeah but if you don't have shared space you're just not going to get much out of it you'll be put a lot of effort into other solutions trying to fix the problem of just not having shared time in space not having that proximity not having that that that that shared time doing the dishes doing laundry whatever. But you can you can just do it a year to time you know fine two or three people and say hey could we live together for the next year okay and during the next year here's what we're going to do we're going to have a kind of family or house or apartment dinner once or twice a week okay not every night but you know Mondays and Thursdays we're always going to do dinner together okay. And then maybe every week day morning before we go to work we're going to do a quick round of prayer requests and save the words prayer together. You know however early enough to where we can all be there at prayer in the morning and during that year we'll we let's go let's go do some community service in our neighborhood together once a month. During that year let's go on one vacation together the four of us that we were like plan to have time off and plan our budgets to have money to like do a fun vacation together. And then. Yeah and maybe you can do some kind of confession and accountability kind of things we don't even have to go to the same church we do that could be pretty cool. But yeah let's serve together let's do meals together let's pray together let's do some vacations together who knows maybe maybe you know we we can all do things giving together or Christmas together and let's just do that for one year. And then at the end of that year if you want to keep you want to do if you want to re up it for another year we can if one of you needs to move out you can and a different person can move in but let's just let's do that. There are expectations there are rhythms. It is lived in but it's only for one year of time and it's and it's not super cumbersome. I think that's a great like way to start that is still stretch for many people but not that weird not too weird. What about first of all I love how you how that it scaled up it started with. You know the two to three and living in an an a multi bedroom and then. It builds from there I think that's very. Atainable right when you start when you start with one step at a time I am wondering about the person who says I don't have two to three people that I could go and ask that I don't know where I where I would go you know to find. Those two or three people and a different layer would be what if they say no right and then I feel this I feel this rejection so maybe you can address those two things practically. And some of this to it's like I'm going to get to which my church questions going to be next we'll say that one but some of it is like the way our churches are structured I think. If church is just like this place you go to watch a show and leave like you're right it's so. But where does somebody because that's pretty I think that's real for for people to go I don't have two or three people that I could ask do you have. Rainstorming for them on where they could go to find two or three obviously develop right to develop. Relationships like that that that could lead you know to that sort of ask and yeah I'll just obviously but there for now. Yeah yeah the unfortunate I don't have a good answer to that question particularly kind of people are feel like there's not an easy access to that meaning those kind of people at their church they don't know who those people are already. Or they may know who those people are at their church or know those people already but but either you know those those people they might invite may. May be preferring to live alone by this point or they may prefer to live alone maybe like that's a nice idea but I kind of don't want to. Get into that again you know and and I know a lot of people who are single in their 30s and 40s and beyond who settle into preferring to live alone not because. Like they're not lonely living alone they are but because the the pain of the revolving door of roommates yeah was more painful than just being alone. They don't actually like where they are they don't actually like living alone they actually they they they they they there's part there's ways that they've known themselves to the fact that they hate it but they hate it. They just think it's the least bad option available yeah and I think if we could in people's 20s build these kind of one year recurring intentional Christian community things. And then some and then that could lead to two groups of people who say okay what if we do this for three years what if we do this for 10 years right it could build into something that eventually is people making. Long term or maybe even lifetime commitments to a community. The capability they could be a place where a single person there 40s says I don't have it in me for revolving door of roommates yeah. If I know this to the people all live or something next 30 years I can do that. And what you're describing is a lot more intentional than just having roommates right because everybody has a bad roommate story this person was running a room and they were doing all this stuff right as debauchery here they were loud or but I you know. Where you're you're talking about a community that's intentional in the sense of we're here for this purpose like we're we're we're agreeing to this covenant you know we're. And that's a that's a big difference too right for for people listening it's not just about having roommates the why would argue. Just being around other humans is still. The nothing that you're just being by yourself and nothing looking at you but these blank walls. But this is different than just having roommates it's culting something. Yeah and I don't want it in any way shame anyone who's listening who is one of those people in the 30s or four is to be on and prefers to live alone and feels like I'm kind of putting something on them absolutely not I get. How painful the revolving door of room of roommates has been. So I just want to say that but yeah to the struggle of kind of finding people to do this you know I do think in an ideal world our churches the places where we would we would find those people. But I think there's a couple of reasons why I maybe we're not finding those people at our church. One of them is that I think a lot of our churches are not teaching about a robust theology of vocational singleness and our churches are kind of refusing to accept. The responsibility of the kind of the church first accepted and acts six to to to make sure those who are a cell that in single find family and have a home. And so as a result, you know we know statistics like single people are more likely to struggle with depression and anxiety. They're more likely to doubt whether God exists and they're less likely to rebound from down. So some of it is just that they're single people who may be remin to be single for a lifetime who are starting out on our churches post college and because of the lack of the support they were getting from their churches they de-converted. There's not fallen Jesus anymore because the lack of support they're getting. There's some other people who you know maybe were supposed to walk out single this long term but instead demanded the gift of marriage from God. And are now married then maybe never were supposed to be married and we're supposed to still be single in a healthy way. There's also ways that maybe there's just some single Christians who feel like I mean there's a lot you know I work with churches for a living I do the church consulting for a living I know that one of the most stable ways. One of the best ways to stabilize your giving and a church is to is for to be anchored to kids basically and families who have kids that are the most likely to stick around and to donate consistently and so just naturally a lot of churches programming them the cons revolving around. Attracting and keeping families with younger kids middle school and younger. So there's a lot of single people who just stop going to church even though they're still following Jesus because. It's not optimized for them it's optimized in a different direction and so I think all these things contribute to to yeah single person there 40 saying I love to start some intentional Christian community like that. I don't know where those people are and they're not in my church. And there's gotta be ways for someone let's say that's gonna stay alone living alone for whatever reason whether that's what they prefer or they listen to this and they're just like okay whatever I can't do that I'm just I still have to think that there's gotta be ways they can be. I'm just brainstorming out of this conversation's challenged me because I'm a pastor you know and I want to I want to get to the church question here next because. I'm putting myself in the same boat like we as churches have done a poor job with this and I want to brainstorm some ways we can do better but I think. For those who are listening that are single there's there's gotta be ways. To even if you're going to still live alone to be connecting with people regularly outside of your. Nine to five job or you know you go to work and like there's there's gotta be way I just feel like it's such a default today because of technology and what's given to us is to go home lock the doors watch TV set on the couch and then you're just you're just isolating yourself right and and there's all these these isolating behavior so. I just want to kick that around you know for listeners that if that's you I mean you've got to find out what's happening in your community you have to be around people join. Much you know join like clubs or hobby groups or you know like stuff at your your church depending on the size of your church and what they offer throughout the week I just feel like. I had at a basic level we we have to up are I don't know we have we have to up our level of of of of connection and then perhaps. Pasting the fruit of that and then going okay maybe I'll listen to that Peter guy now and actually like change you know change something that's that's a bit more a bit more next level. But so I don't know I have some thoughts on or I have a question about the church really that I want that I want to get to do you have any thoughts on that first before I move on. As far as just ways people can connect that that you've seen that's worked well that perhaps isn't you know living within the same place. Right still being rooted in a community and and having connection. Many many days during the week and just and what that can look like. Yeah, yeah what we mean one suggestion and like one source of kind of empathy or sympathy one thing is I just you know I know even even talking to my married friends right or sorry let me back up. And we all would prefer connection that's just organic in spontaneous right that's the most magical stuff that's the sexiest up that's what we all want we want to we want to just connect when we feel like it. And and and let that be the driver and every married person I talked to they get to a certain point in their marriage and they're like if we don't schedule date nights and a recurring way that they just show up on our schedule and we do it. We don't sometimes schedule sex in a way that we just know this is the night we're going to have sex it just doesn't happen. And that's not because our marriage is failing it's just because in life. You can't rely on things just only doing things when they're spontaneous or when they just come over organically like he just just not how it works you know. And I don't think friends are any different so I I just I really encourage people to like you know pick two or three people on your life that you're going to get breakfast or coffee or dinner or lunch with every week. And put it on your calendar and do it every week no matter whether you want to go or not. And then find a cluster of friends here plus reference there to do a trivia night or a kickball league or something and then just put it on the schedule and do it but I think it's really important to have recurring like commitments. For connection. But I have I have lots of one on one on my calendar for for every week I'm something is maxed out and there's a by like breakfast and particular just because I know that like you know if if I wait and for it to kind of be convenient and for me to kind of. Being the mood to reach out to someone for breakfast then we'll see each other once every two months yeah. Or if we just make ourselves go to breakfast on Tuesdays and 6 a.m. every week I'll see my my my my my my God suns dad and and one of my good buddies from college I'll see him every week so that's what we do. Yeah I love that well switch over the church side and I think even as you say that there's there's things church is offer or paratrooper ministries too. That in there in the areas of I mean I'm most most moment ministry stuff because I'm a man and I have beyond the battle book and things but I got to think there's some women's ministry stuff out there as well though I think I've seen some strong. Men's ministry stuff locally online as well but where you your your scheduled and thing can be. Does your church have a singles ministry that meets Thursday nights and is there a men's Bible study or a women's Bible studies small group you know that you can go. Those are limited but at least they're scheduled right like I love what you said about it being scheduled and intentional. I know a friend of mine runs a men's ministry and part of what they do is just meet at the same restaurant every Tuesday night and they have dinner and they have deep conversations and it's the same group of 15 guys you know give a take that show up and sometimes it's built for you and you just have to show up. You know in fine fine those those spaces so that's just a suggestion you know for listeners my question is with myself as a pastor you know there is a reality to we don't live in the act to culture anymore we don't live in this village lifestyle like we've talked about we're in this. I'm a community lifestyle and I do I touched on this earlier but I struggle with whether it's the example I gave before which is you know someone who's gay same sex attracted and we say. Okay a life of single cell obesity that's it for you good luck to you you know we'll see a next Sunday and we here's what we have the offer like in in a standard church we have our Sunday morning service so at least you have that on Sunday morning and then we have your small group and you have that once a week and that's it and that's supposed to replace like a lifetime you know of of community. But another example I my church we planted our church two years ago or intentionally in the inner city multi ethnic and we're a great mix of like inner city folks and people commuting in from other places but. I find have find this often where. I think that's the way that you know how they relax it's their community and I feel like when it looks when I look at discipleship and I go I'm telling you that you have to give all that up. The people that you're living the village life like they're living the village life and this is an impoverished neighborhood type setting so you have literally multiple generations in a house not by choice. But by necessity and then you're hanging out on the porch kind of numbing out on life and I'm saying don't do that anymore don't do those behaviors that have you drinking in the marijuana instead I'm going to give you a Sunday morning service and a once a week small group and maybe once every quarter I can take you off to lunch right. This is what I feel like I have to to replace the what they're where they're finding meaningful connection and those behaviors aren't going to stop most likely as long as they're with because you're going to become like the people you know you hang out with so I just want to pick your brain on this because. For me I go well then I have to be their community because I'm I'm the pastor right there it's the gay guy. You know who single-selle bit and lonely or it's the guy on the porch who's like this is his life and he that's his connection and. I'm married my wife is an introvert and like she has a full-time job and I cannot just open the door to my house because I don't live in the act to culture like I live in this culture and. I don't expect you to have the silver bullet answer to all these things but the question I want to nail down on is what can churches do within this culture. To provide better community for all because and I love that this point we've talked it's really like the initiative of the individual listening there is a lot of initiative that the person has to take but I feel like as a pastor. We've got to do a better job like we've got to do a better job of providing this type. Some type of of consistent community especially for those that are isolated but in a way that doesn't kill pastors if we can avoid that so I would just maybe what have you seen churches doing that that works well or you know what what advice would you give to a church that's going on man we want to get better at this we want to have more of these spaces and communities connection spaces where where people can come together to connect. Yeah for sure for sure well in some ways you know my the kind of ministry that I feel like God is called me to. It has been kind of focusing on the surgeries or the real solutions instead of the band a their life rafts. There are lots of people out there who could give you some life raft for band aid ideas. My fear is and what I'd like to notice in my lifetime in the church is that we just only we just buy. Truck loads of band dates. Yeah. And never do the surgery. So I'm just going to talk about the surgery. That's real. Yeah. I mean I think and I think in some ways the best place to start is is with is with single people in particular because they can if you found have have single people. Committing to intentional Christian community committing to a place they can become a nuclear us of a broader experience of intentional Christian Christian community. In a church and could lead to a movement of a bunch of people in a church saying hey we're all actually living this neighborhood. And we're going to commit to this neighborhood. Maybe it's only 30% of the people in your church, but those people are going to find real community. And I think in some ways that begins with a key lever for that is making a distinction between the singleness we're all born into the temporary abstinence singleness we're all born into. That can continue into one's 30s and 40s and 50s kind of an uncalled uncommitted perpetual kind of born into singleness. Distinguished that from the kind of singleness that Jesus talks about a Matthew 19 and Paul talks about him first Corinthians seven. The kind of singles is actually gifted it's actually blessed is a permanent commitment to singleness for the sake of kingdom work. Permanent giving up of romance dating marriage sex biological children for the sake of using the availability from that that we would have used to do the kingdom work of raising kids to instead do other kingdom work. But still in the context of community. And so I think in particular if our church is actually teaching what the scriptures have to say about vocational singleness versus temporary singleness. We're helping every Christian discern between vocational singleness and Christian marriage. We're distinguishing between who are these singles who you'll call the Christian marriage but are right now kind of in this kind of per kind of never ending temporary singleness. And we need to help them move into Christian marriage more quickly. Okay. And then who are the Christians who are call to vocational singleness and they're actually they're not looking for short term solutions they're looking for the final solution. They're looking for a place to find a lifetime family because then you're going to identify the actual the cluster of singles. Who are interested in building real intentional Christian community. So we have to distinguish between those two groups of singles first. And in many ways give them the categories and inspire them and help them discern between those options. And give them hope for that. And then I think our churches can be incubating those intentional Christian communities particularly for vocational singles for particularly for singles committed to singleness for a lifetime. And so I've noticed in in small ways that when those kind of houses of you know four single people all committed to vocational singleness all go into the same church. Start living in a certain neighborhood and sort of inviting some of the myriad people in their church with who have kids and some of the other single people and saying hey what if you move in next door. What if we all move into the same neighborhood. What if we move in with and walking distance of each other and we start to have do some open door life with each other. It's going to be small. It's going to be organic but I think that's what's going to make a difference for like 50 years from now. Hmm. All right. I'm going to increment myself raise your hand if you've never taught at your church about the difference between the vocational calling of singleness and the calling of marriage and helping people discern which is better for for them or which one got. Calling into and for those only listening my hand is raised here. Yeah, that's that's amazing. Like to hear you I receive that from you. Profitically like I don't think they're very very very few churches are teaching that to singles to to to you know anyone like they're not we're not teaching that it's like just this default. Like you're going to get married and if you don't you know I mean that's how that's how everybody takes it right like it's it's it's man so I think that as a starting point is that's really challenging to me like yeah I am I really want to that that's it me feels like going to a game changer for for a starting point for for this whole conversation. Yeah, it's practical yeah and and I think also it actually will lead to healthier marriages for those who are called to marriage and and I want to be clear I don't think that this means that like 50% of Christians are called to singleness and 50% are called to marriage it's probably still something like 9 to 10 80 20 I don't know you know like the stuff I think still. Marriage is going to be the most common kind of vocation for Christians but I think if we enter into this discernment process with an open hand in this. Then those who are eventually called to Christian marriage won't see it as something that they were owed or something that is just default but instead a calling. To lay down their life for the sake of the gospel in a particular way. Yeah. To go on that mission with their spouse but they're ultimately called to just as much sacrifice for the sake of the kingdom as any single person as any cell of a person for lifetime. It's just a different path. So then we'll take for granted that gift of marriage and then for those who are ultimately called to singleness. If they actually are going about this in an open hand in way and are taught the beauty of both of these options and hopefully eventually see these model both in their churches. Then they don't feel like they're being cheered of anything but being called into. And we send my life doing life with some of the married people that I'm closest to who have kids the more we've done life around each other and seen what's beautiful and what's difficult about vocational single this in Christian marriage. The more than actually neither of us feels like. We've got a better or the grass is greener on the other side. We both see that like God called us to different things. These are both good. They are things about the other that high jealous of and there's things about what I've got that I know they don't have that I'm really grateful for. Yeah. And I think that's where we could get to as a church. Yeah. I have a practical question. This is for obviously a friend who's listening and so. What's your advice for a gay same sex attracted Christian. Celebrate single person they're living alone and they can't really find a church because they're committed this person is committed to the traditional biblical sexual ethic. But the churches that they're finding that say they're committed to that as well are they do not feel comfortable. Being real in that space. There's also very condemning messages about if your gay or same sex attracted in those spaces. They feel like there are two options are the church like that where they have to hide. They're orientation and they can't they just can't find real community there even though they're living again surrendering all this to Jesus. Oh, being you know what what we believe is true in scripture. And then the other side is the open and affirming churches and like I don't want to go there because they're they're encouraging me to sin like they're telling me to live you know it's in so the result is there they're they're extra lonely they don't they can't even find that that Christian community. And on top of that and maybe this is just for like if you could speak some hope and encouragement to them where they feel like this extra shame. Because one they feel like they're the only one you know that that that is this way and they can't even like talk about this at church. So it's there's this extra level of shame around something that isn't a sin this is this is they're not they're not living and you know any sort of active sinful lifestyle. So I'm wondering if you could just I mean it is a specific person I want to give some encouragement to but but you know just. Yeah, we're talking about church being so important and and where they're living they're like I can't I can't find a church. Yeah, that's tough that's real tough. And I know those those those faces exist you know where where they're there that those really are the only two options in terms of churches. Yeah, I mean I'm sure the person is considered like if it was possible to move to a city where there may be other options but I know there's some people who because of work or because you know they're caring for a parent who who is ill. Or whatever the reasons are you know moving is just not not an option. And so a couple things I took gestion that space is there are some kind of again it's not embodied says not what I would like first suggest but there are some spaces online to connect with with other Christians that are kind of on the same journey as this person is. There is a kind of a fairly large kind of private Facebook group of gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic where a lot of people can connect. And find support from a distance and maybe even discover there's there's people in their area that have a similar story and convictions that they can kind of do life alongside. There is a really neat conference called the the Revoys conference that does kind of a yearly gathering of of gay Christians committed to a traditional sexual ethic and they also have. Some ways to kind of stay connected in between those conferences including kind of some like local chapters in different major cities and so there may be a local chapter in in that person city or somewhere with some driving distance. Even if it's somewhere that like once a month they drive an hour to hang out with people who are along a similar journey that could be a real big encouragement that would be in person. And then there's some other ministries kind of specifically to different denominations that they kind of kind of provide fellowship around some of those some of those things. And and it may also be true that. Despite the fact that there's all these kind of unfair circumstances stacked against this person right and and far beyond for me to ask this person to take on any more hardship right or do anything any more difficult. And I know that in what I see in my life sometimes is I'm bringing to the Lord some of my very reasonable frustrations about circumstances and what and what ought to exist for me already but does not exist yet and kind of say to God like God you know how much I'm already on empty and and and feel and feel like I don't have it I need to be healthy because of maybe the citizens other people have made. And I need you God to show up or other Christians to show up and make this work for me and and Lord has very tenderly said. I hear you I hear you. And and and I want to ask you to do some more hard things and maybe you do the work of creating some of the things you need. Yeah and so maybe the Lord is calling this this this this person is friend of yours to choose a church that maybe teach in the traditional sexual ethic and seems to send some signals of a possibility of compassion. And then go to that church and share their story knowing they're going to get some negative reactions and teach that church how to care for them. Knowing that in the process of teaching that church teaching those pastors how to care for your friend. Your friends are going to get hurt a little bit. Yeah. Maybe the Lord's calling them to do that. I don't know. I'm not putting it. I'm not working the Holy Spirit. I don't work. But I know this sometimes when I'm not had when I needed and I've gone to the Lord and I've said okay I'm I'm on empty. I've done the best I can it's your turn God's to make it work. God has come back and he said I hear you. And I want to invite you to to push a little bit more. Yeah. So I don't know. That's good. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. We're winding down here. I wonder if you could just give any word of encouragement we've already I think have but just just kind of someone who's resigned himself to. I think even is you know your work as a counselor fits into this as well. I think it's just easy for us to resign ourselves to again my work as with helping men overcome pornography sexual sin and there's guys that just resigned themselves to porn because it suits them and it meets the need of comfort even though it's empty and false and I think there's singles that resign themselves to a life of isolation. I think there's married people that resign themselves to a life of isolation but I mean I see you live in it you you have you you're living into this space you're living into this community just I get to sense you're I mean you're saying this is worth it like this is worth making the effort. There's those that have that have stopped making the effort maybe they've tried and failed and so now there's sort of a learned helplessness is there anything just kind of as we we wrap up I'll give you another will do a kind of a final question. I'll kind of a final question here but just for as we get closer wrap it up just a just a word of encouragement to someone that feels like. They're kind of tired of trying and they've just resigned themselves to to the rut that they're in. Totally totally. Yeah and at least for me the times when I feel like I particularly got in a rut and tired of trying. Maybe it was because I got almost to a place of a little bit of kind of depression or despair around it and for me was particularly what was often characteristic of that is I had some some brief or sadness around what I didn't have yet that I wasn't. That I kind of didn't want to connect with. And and some of that like frustrated grief you know un un un. My resistance to mourning in some ways what what wasn't what was what was kind of draining the motivation and like writing me out. And or things sometimes I worried like always too late you know yeah I I ducked out of that group three years ago I can't go back or I've already gone out of the habit of of really put myself out there in that way I can't start again or maybe we feel some kind of shame towards ourselves or God that we've kind of. We've we've we've we've we've stopped trying and we've gotten in a rut and you know I want to say that like the Lord knows all of the the difficult circumstances that a paled on top of each other to make it feel like it's kind of impossible for you to try again. And I know that it's been knows how hard it's been. I don't think the Lord for a for a second I don't think the Lord for for a second is. You know looking down upon you with shame or disappointment. I think he's just like he wants to care for you he wants to hold you and he's eager for you to get back up again and try with the clean slate like. Don't worry about mistakes you made in the past don't worry about how. I think it's been a long time you tried and it's not seem to work out or how long you've given it up and you it's never too late to like to start again and to try again. And I've seen that to be true in in my own life. You know it was it was worth. Trying again it was worth getting back up and. Putting just a little bit more effort into and so some of the things I hope for. And I think it's a very important thing to say morning you know the beginning of what you said about your story morning is that is that sort of like a holding on to. This life that I feel like I should have had like kind of this alternate reality and I I'm holding on to that and so the morning is the morning process. The grieving that that isn't going to happen and moving on like there's a healthy of moving on here I'm not I'm not an expert in this I just kind of ask you to kind of unpack that a little bit for someone because I think there's there's. I think what you said is really helpful for because a lot of our depression I feel like comes from being feeling stuck like I'm stuck in this place I want to be over I want to I want to that and God isn't giving me that but I'm here. Can you just kind of unpack if anything I said helpful you could use it if not just ignore it but just kind of unpack what you mean by by morning and how that was helpful for you to kind of move forward. Yeah so kind of you know the you know a lot of kind of therapists or kind of psychologists or whatnot would say that like the typically depression at least clinically it comes from kind of a loss of meaning or purpose or love or people in our life or or or or identity. And then we have not grieved that loss we've avoided grieving that loss. And then that ungrieved loss kind of turns into despair and hopelessness and greatness and numbing. And the solution to depression then is in some ways actually to be sad. The solution to depression is actually identify the thing that you lost that was really sad that felt too sad to connect with. So you went to things to numb yourself so you didn't feel sadness and instead. Go to that thing and be sad like really cry it out or whatever the version is for you however you need to mourn or grieve but like really honor this thing was lost this thing died this thing broke and that sucked and that deserves a funeral you know metaphorically. And and so I think in my own life there was a way that like I would just I just felt like to be a good Christian I always had to put a smile on and believe everything was great about my story and and everything was working out just how God wanted it to work out and that gave me no permission to be sad about my circumstances and to mourn what was. Soky about my world around me and about me you know and that led to depression that led to me using sexual addiction as a way to numb my sadness instead of connecting with my sadness and accelerated a process of depression but when I actually just. Honestly myself like this is sucky and really sad and I think actually need to cry about it I think actually need to be sad about it and give myself permission to be sad. That's kind of when the depression went away that's when like because depression kind of awesome often manifests itself is like a lack of motivation it takes our motivation our desire to try again. Some ways and sometimes connecting with our sadness, crying out, giving ourselves permission to mourn and to grieve is the way to rediscover motivation and desire to try again. Thank you. So far for everyone but for some people. Yeah well and and that's a type of thing I think anyone in that spot go to your counselor take what you just said and say what does it like for me you know what yeah. I want to explore this further what does it look like for me I feel like there's some things I need to mourn there's some things I need to grieve I don't know how to do that. You know help me do that but what I what what I see in you is you that was a part of a process of of un- un-stucking you know you were un-stucked where you could start to move forward again and you grieved what wasn't there anymore like funeral and but and we're going to now can go through a healing process of that. And but there's life to be had there beyond that right and and because you're not yeah so you that's great that's really good and I just I encourage listeners to not just listen to this podcast and then move on to the next one but if that's you in your situation like yeah meet with the therapist. Talk deeper you know talk deeper about some of these things I would as this look like for me because I'm resonating with some of these themes so let me get you out of here on this Peter just. Just final words that you want to say to listeners if there's if there's maybe some resources you want to direct them to some ways they can connect with you. You know online or just some resources that you offer I love this I think we we've hit on some we've hit on some really great points and I'd love to help connect people particularly you know. People that are feel isolated they they they need some resources connections you've mentioned some great ones already but just anything else that you want to say kind of as a final word to point people on the right direction as we wrap things up. Yeah, yeah I know every person's story in journey is unique and so you know this may just prompt some specific questions you know something.

The entire alumni community is free outside of those retreats so head over to beyond the battle dot net if you are looking for that type of community. Thanks for listening I hope this podcast is an encouragement to you hope a challenge is you hope it helps you to think more critically and to take practical steps in your life. You're an experience to love a Jesus that he has for you he loves you and he is inviting you into that love and just to kind of just piggyback off the last question I gave Peter. If you're in that state of feeling defeated feeling like I've tried this I can't get back up again you know just reach out for help don't try to do it by yourself reach out to a counselor therapist. Many if you don't have insurance fine one that that has a pay scale there's free counseling services out there as well, but have somebody help you get over the hump get over the stuckness. But to keep going I'm there's just to keep going God's timeline has got as so much slower than we are. He moves so slowly and just know that that's normal he has not given up on you. But but take those steps be intentional be tenacious if you can't be tenacious get someone next to you that will be tenacious on your behalf. I will push you and prod you let's spur one another on towards loving good deeds as the book of Hebrews says so I hope this podcast episode helps you do that hope the flip side helps you as a whole thank you so much to those that support the show via patreon.
