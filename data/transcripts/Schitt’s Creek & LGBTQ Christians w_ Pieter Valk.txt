It is a tool from learning about the faith And going deeper into our faith And so often through the history of Christianity That has happened through dialogue Say in August in a dialogue Just like Plato and had socrates writing in a dialogue The Baltimore catacus in one of those Fares catacusms is written as a dialogue Thomas Aquinas when he wrote his great work His summa is written as a dialogue And so I am committed to the idea that through conversations With people we can really learn So you might not agree with everything I say Everything that Peter says But in my prayers and preparing for this episode I'm just praying that we can all draw closer to Christ Through this and if you think differently You can let us know you can leave a comment And we'll talk about it chairably So yeah go ahead Yeah and if I could clarify Maybe two things just from the star Yes you may come Some fears of some listeners The first is that What does this guy mean when he says a traditional sexual I think I want to be clear about that I think that God's best for all Christians Is either a lifetime vocation Of abstinent singleness For the sake of kind of work with undivided attention Or a lifetime vocation of marriage Between one Christian woman and one Christian man With an openness to the important kind of work of raising children And so that's what I think The church has how the church is historically understood The scripture is a teach about God's best for us And that's what I believe in So that's what I mean when I say a traditional sexual ethic And then the other question people might have had when they heard me share He's calling himself gay What does that mean? We probably won't get into that conversation here But I just want to clarify the lines Because the word gay or LGBT or queer To refer to myself I'm only using those words to mean I experience same sex attraction I'm not meaning Using that word to communicate my Theological convictions Or sexual practices I'm committed to a traditional sexual ethic I'm committed to celibacy to vocational singleness But I think this is relevant to the conversation we're having About about culture and about a shit's creek Is that you know Some in the church may be prefer for people to use the phrase same sex attraction That phrase is never used in the Inchist Creek Those aren't the words that the kids in our views Are using to talk about these topics And we are already going to have enough talk I tough enough time convincing them that God believes in a certain way about this and it's Why is this for us to follow God's wisdom If we had on top of that an additional hurdle of convincing them to use language They never use in their schools And they never see in their TV shows Maybe that's an additional barrier that's not worth it Yeah, so that's why I use the words gay LGBT queer because those are the words that kids are using these days And I want to reach them Yeah, thanks for clarifying that And I'm sure that does set some people's minds I'm sure other people did not set their minds It is but again, no matter who you are and where you are in your walk Like you're welcome here And I hope you listen to what I have to say and what Peter has to say And one last disclaimer And I don't want to show show to be disclaimers But just I want to share a little bit of my own experience Is like my life of faith has been very much influenced by Like some gay men who were mentors of mine Like on my first retreat with my youth group when I was 15 And that's like the I'd grown up in church But that was the experience where I was like, whoa Jesus is real and God loves me My small group leader who was an adult I was a choir in our church He was a gay man I didn't know that at the time I don't think he was acting on those desires At the time he's not really part of the church anymore But like he was an image of like a strong Christian man to me And like I am indebted in my faith The him my choir director all through high school My roommate my freshman year of college Who's transgender Like these are The first person to welcome me to college when I first was got there Now I guess you I don't know how what she would say But now she lives as an lesbian And so these people in my life who I'm very much indebted in my faith To them and so I just I have gratitude for those people In my life so Enough disclaimers let's get into it What is she it's creepy? So she's creepy if you don't know it Is just this really quirky Weird Silly little show With these characters the roses who are not a ragster Riches but a riches to rags story and it ran for I think it was seven seasons I meant to write that down But I didn't so but I'm pretty sure it ran for for seven seasons and it just ended I think in 2020 And you know if you haven't heard of this I'm sure you know somebody who has watched this show It was huge and it's really funny Just the characters are great The acting is great It's just I I love it I love it. I think it's great What do you like about this show Peter? Yeah, gosh the I think how quotable it is Is the the first things that comes to mind I mean I think you quoted How kind of Alexis often refers to her her brother David You David My brother's name is David so I say that to him all the time And he's never watched the show so he's no one he was going on But I don't care So many great quotes there's this scene Where David and Moira his mom are attempting to cook together and both of them have no idea what they're doing and They have this conversation about how how do you fold in the cheese And My the guys and I that live in in the house here together and you know we're we're also cooking meals for each other and That comes up regularly that bit so yeah very quotable Yeah, there was what time I was trying to do one of those things on Instagram where like you pull people and they can write in their answers And then I didn't know how to like share what people responded so I'm like texting my friends I have this group check test like five or six of my friends like how do you do this and then like you just do this I was like I don't see it you just do this and finally somebody's like you just folded in David and I lost it It's like this thing that should be super simple But you're just not getting it anyway. Yeah, so absolutely you're right a little bit of Alexis that whole bit where she does where she's she has like That song it's like a Britney Spears song that she does that it's so yeah so many quotable moments and just ridiculous characters kind of like parks and Rack kind of like the office. I think if you liked those shows It's kind of got a similar vibe of just these ridiculous characters. You can't believe how silly they are Yeah, for sure. Yeah, and I think in some ways you know what it reminds me of in some ways is it reminds me of the Simpsons I grew up watching the Simpsons and it's funny my dad was like very strict with what TV we could watch She was a lot of things he didn't let us watch but for some reason the Simpsons he thought was the smartest thing on TV And we'd watch the Simpsons together as the family and it kind of presents the worst of America in the best of America all together And I think I think I think shit's creaked does that really well. It kind of kind of pokes fun at some of the materialism But it all shows like some of the softer side and the community so there's something that's just yeah really like about the show so yeah Anything you don't like just artistically about the show? I'll be honest. I'm not a big comedy person in general. Yeah. So, but I mean, I don't have much to complain about. I think maybe similar to early seasons of like Parks and Rack Or maybe like a place a show like a rest in development. There's a couple like cringy characters for me That maybe sometimes make watching a little difficult. Yes, but but I learned to like them over the season Yeah, Roland is like that for me. Where I was like, oh, I just just get easiest. I just yeah, Roland is definitely like that. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So let's talk about so some of the characters we have we have Johnny Rose Let's put some pictures up here on the screen. So he's he's the father. He ran a video cassette rental business, which of course Went under, but he was super rich and they were living in LA and they had this huge mansion with his wife Mora who was like a daytime soap opera star for a while But now she's kind of washed up and then on the excess who's just kind of this spoiled brat socialite who's just all was off on you know a cruise in the French Riviera Or traipsing around the world doing ridiculous things kind of kind of like the stereotypical Kardashian or Paris Hilton kind of kind of life And then the brother David you David who's also super ridiculous And just his fashion the things that he wears and Yeah, and then they get to this small town they they the only thing they have left is they one time Johnny bought a town like in a Poker game and so they end up in this town of Shits Creek which is just like Poet on America and they meet Very different it's kind of like the odd couple, but it's like odd America's it's like the two sides of America in in a lot of ways Do you have a character that you specifically this speaks to you and you love Yeah, I mean, I think because of some of the themes in the in the show that we'll talk about I there's some ways that I relate to both David and Patrick and the character in the show And yeah and find their stories entertaining But yeah, and then Stevie as well, which we'll probably chat some about just got her dry humor Very entertaining reminds me of gosh, who's the character from parks and wreck who all the female character who also has very dry humor I'm sure what's her name. Yeah, I don't know if you know put it listeners put it in the show notes if you know so yes, he dates Andy Dwyer For a while, I'm not sure no a drawing. Yes, thank you guys You got it in front of the police. Yeah, she definitely has some April vibes to her. Yeah, good, good, very cool, very cool So what what also I think is a funny about this show is it's made primarily by Canadians like the So Johnny the actor that plays Johnny and actor that plays David like their father and son in real life And then they're like the sister isn't the show to the place Twyla and their Canadian and they decided to make the show They had this concept for a show and I kind of feel like it's Canadians lampooning America a little bit like making fun of the roses and just like how Materialistic they are and I know that that's something I feel like is even true of American Christianity is sometimes it can be Overly materialistic and we kind of lose sight of the gospel for You know being upper middle class. I don't know if you've ever had experience of that in your ministry But I feel like it's that's like a constant fight. I'm trying to fight even in my own life, you know Yeah, for sure and yeah criticism of kind of the the American dream. Yeah, replacing God. Yes So which is maybe easy to to happen in its subtle ways and for people and our churches not to recognize yeah I think so too So it reminds me of Jesus saying like blessed or the poor blessed or the poor in spirit You know in the in the be attitudes in in in 95 and in Luke 6 like you like you expect Jesus to say when someone says oh I'm blessed Hashtag blessed blessings on blessings on blessings on blessings. They're talking about in in wrapsaw is they're talking about like money, you know Affection from people good relationships all the stuff they have and Jesus is like no blessed or the poor Blessed or the poor in spirit like what do you what do you make of that do you have a thought on that yeah I Recently was a reminded of the kind of influence that Saint John of the cross and Saint Teresa of Avala kind of that those Christian missed this had on me and it seemed like one thing they were putting their finger on was that Even some of some of these things you've described that they are good and they can come from God. Yes They are blessings and we can be thankful for them. There's nothing inherently evil about most of those things that you mentioned But it can but can problematic when we are more in love with the gifts than the giver yes, and and sometimes Too many of those gifts Can can spoil us can make it difficult for us to to love the right things and so it seems like at times at least my life spiritually That God seems to have kind of pulled away some of those gifts to teach me how to love the true things and to love the giver And it seems like there's a version of that kind of happening in the show that the universe is is is taking away from this family those More kind of materialistic pleasures and and giving them an opportunity to discover the true things Yeah, so you know spoiler alert Oh, I'm terrible by the colors in the end Yeah, but yeah, so I don't know I get I get some vibes some dark night of the soul vibes from this show. Yeah, I absolutely get that that like through Not that God like punishes people with bad things, you know, but God can God make all can make all things work for the good of those who love him according to his purpose And like he can take these awful situations even awful situations of our own doing of like bad business investments like video tape shop and The 21st century, you know, even through that like God can work that for the good and You know, I think we from a Christian perspective can see like yeah and it got is in in some kind of small our way, you know, redeeming these people in kind of a unavary practical level of helping them to grow into maturity And using these circumstances to help them help them mature and grow into like better versions of themselves. So Yeah, I loved what you said sometimes we value the gift more than the giver man tweet that get that trending that should be well, I think I'm quoting another Yeah, anyway whoever whoever said it, I'm glad you said it too because that that is great. And I think that's a great way to kind of conceptualize that idea that Jesus says, you know, blessed are the poor and spirit like it's Recognizing that even if we have an abundance of riches still were poor, right still still we have this need this in our ultimate need is for a relationship with God and nothing else can fill that no relationship No amount of of wealth or American dream or white picket fence again those things can be good, but they're never going to they're never going to satisfy Yeah, that those things can be stewarded well, yes, but there's a temptation for us to distract for them to distract us from the true things and so it seemed like to me Jesus is almost saying it might be easier for those who have less Because to to love Jesus well because they they don't have as much of the temptation to to lose themselves in pleasures that they think that they have created for themselves. Yeah, so not to say it is easy to be poor in any way, but to say there is there's a particular temptation of wealth. Yes, there's an opportunity to steward it well that's a temptation for it to to numb us from reality and numb us from our need for God. Amen, amen, I love that. You mentioned Saint John the Cross in St. Theresa of Avala by the way, do you know my daughter's name is Avala? No, I didn't. Yeah, my daughter's name is Avala, so I don't love Theresa of Avala, she's like, that's my girl. So you mentioned this idea of the dark night of the soul, can you give us maybe just like a 30 second to one minute just what is that for people that don't know about the dark night of the soul? Oh, sure, so these Christian these Catholic mystics suggested that it's actually fairly common after kind of you know, and a more mature place in someone's spiritual life for God to intentionally make himself harder to find harder to sense harder to feel. So to kind of to teach and discipline us to to connect with him in deeper ways. And and sometimes that might be if we found it easy to feel good while praying and worshiping. Yeah, but we've gone to a place where we're more in love with the feeling of feeling good while praying and worshiping than really desiring God. Yeah, that got us teaching us he's he's he's training us to to hear his whispers. Yeah, instead of following his kind of shouting, ultimately drawing us into a deeper relationship with him. But that time of God feeling distant may last for a long time. Yeah, and for even some saints it seemed to last for their entire lifetime. I never got out of that dark night of the soul that kind of sins of being in a desert. And so that's kind of normal if anyone listening is sling like they're in that place now. You're not alone. You're not the only Christian to have experienced that. It is painful. It's ultimately for our good, but it makes sense why it doesn't feel good. Anyway, would encourage anyone who feels like they're experiencing something like that to to grab a copy of. Interior castle by Saint Teresa of Avala or Saint John of the Cross, the Dark Knight of the Soul or talk to your priest. Yeah, talk to our spiritual mentor in your life about about this season for you. Yeah, and I know I've gone through through dark times like that and and looking back. Like some of those were the most spiritually fruitful times because it's easy to think that because I don't feel God. God has abandoned me and that's that God is the Holy Spirit can't be measured by like your emotional level, right? Like the Holy Spirit working in your life. So I think yeah, I love the way you you summarize that. I thought that was a really good way to put it what it makes me think of is I used to be a swim coach when I was younger. And you know at first you kind of hold the kids hand, but at some point you got to like back up and let the kids swim to you. I never reach that like next stage of being able to to go a little bit further on their own. So that's kind of how I understand is it really is an active love and it's in it's for your good. So I love the way that you explained that. Let's talk a little bit about I think this is what everyone's waiting for us to talk about. Let's talk about David in in Patrick. So David in the beginning of the show he has a relationship with Stevie. Not particularly healthy. They're just kind of like hook up buddies, you know, but they do form a real friendship. But I think that friendship. It's almost like the sex kind of gets in the way of the friendship and they're they're better off for each other just as friends. But then it comes out later in the the show. That David is also attracted to men. He kind of there's this this famous scene where he's like I just like the wine. I don't like the label. We're kind of gives you an idea of there. He's his understanding of of kind of how superficial physical differences can be in sexuality can be. And then he meets Patrick who initially is like a business partner. But they come to have this this romance. So I know I said I wouldn't have any more disclaimers, but there's there's one story I do want to share. And I've never shared this publicly before, but I feel like I don't know. I feel like the word put on my heart so I want to share it. So when I was a freshman in college, I shared with you that my roommate now is living as a transgender woman was not at the time at least. I was not aware of that if he she was at the time went by he now goes by she. But we got along great and you know we were we were good roommates, you know we we we we weren't like super good friends, but we got along. This was probably the time in my life when I struggled with sexual sin and pornography more than any other. And I share this because it was it was the first time I had my own internet access the first time I had my own computer. And I was like, you know, I'm not a year more than any other is a time I struggled with that in my life. And I share that because one time when I was doing stuff I should not have been doing. My roommate walked in and like I was caught like literally with my pants down and like I was a church kid like I prayed I played in the worship band. I was going to daily mass I was part of the pro life group I was praying the rosary every night like I was known around campus as like that's church kid. I was a musical theater LGBTQ gay transgender you know seen it is what many people would see as like the anti church the anti. Campus ministry crowd and like here I am like caught in the shame of my own sin and you know I remembered didn't say anything you know and like it was it was awkward or whatever but I guess what I'm saying with this story is. I don't see myself like in any sort of life superiority to people who have different struggles than me for people who are attracted to different things than I'm attracted to. Like all of us are in need of God's grace and God's mercy and God's redemption and like I don't I don't see myself as better than anybody else or more holy than anybody else like I know I know I'm a sinner who needs God's mercy. I just I just kind of want to share that so I feel like I want me to share that who knows maybe that's TMI sorry listeners if that was TMI. So what let's let's talk about this relationship you said that there were some things that both in Patrick's story and in David's story that that you related to can you talk a little bit about that. Yeah so you know I think maybe it's the first to share and kind of related to like to what you just shared this since that I think something that the show feels like it's trying to get at. Is it is kind of to level the playing field to normalize some things that that maybe don't seem normal or the same or is familiar to a lot of us and there's good and bad of that so that's what I hear you sharing with even your personal story is sharing that to say. You know my hurt is not worse my my sin what I struggle with is not worse than what someone else does and and we want to recognize that because we want those who who who who are listening who who may be gay who may be queer to feel we want them to feel free to share in their families and in their churches. Yeah and see God's love and God's wisdom for that part of their life and every part of their life and it's a church or a family where it feels like those things are worse. Yeah those things are more broken than that that's that one that that's not true right that's alive the enemy is trying to tell us to keep us isolated. Yeah and and too that means that we cut ourselves off from support and we hurt so so there's a sense that right I mean yeah then David's character in the show is is his pansexual. You know that means he he's kind of sexually romantically and emotionally attracted towards people regardless of their sexual engender identity right and he's you mentioned he's like in multiple relationships he's really different the girl. And then he's the kind of almost in the three way relationship with the guy and the girl and then he sleeps with an expoia for him and then he gets into this relationship with Patrick and then and like a later season that even contemplating a threesome with another guy is right. So there's a lot going on there and the characters in this show that the don't experience same sex attraction that the straight characters in the show are just are having just as much. Yeah you know kind of meaningless romantic and then sexual encounters or at least boundary list. Yeah not the traditional biblical ethic right yeah so I mean and and gosh I think for a lot of listeners. People who kind of ten years ago would have freaked out about a show that had a prominent gay character are are are people who today are maybe quoting the most quotable things from shit's Creek and thinking nothing of it right I mean. I think back to like a decade ago when modern family or glee first came out and people freaked out about. Gay characters on those shows right I mean again to date us this was before a Supreme Court decision about gay marriage this is back when Barack Obama still said he believed that marriage was was between a man and a woman. And now ten years later we're watching shit's Creek where there's a pansexual main character who's in threples and all kinds of different different things right so so I think there's good about that right that's it's easier for kids to believe that they. aren't unlovable that they are lovable yeah it's easier for kids to believe that they're not grows or evil from real experiencing same sex attraction when the stuff is normalized and media. Because gosh that that's since it being unlovable and grows and evil led to so much depression and suicide out suicide out for people but. I think there's some some a challenge with this could be normalized right so I think I take away from the show could be. That people can have sex with whom ever they'd like to outside of meaningful commitment and there are few of any consequences. Yeah and and the body the but like that you can just treat your body like a thing and use it for whatever you want. Whereas I feel like a more holistic Christian understanding is we aren't just a soul we are a body and a soul and it doesn't just matter what you do with your soul matters what you do with your body and what you do with your body affects your soul and. You know there's a reason we we care for the poor we don't just pray for them right and there's a reason why sex is not just about the physical reactions of your body but about a commitment of soul mind. You know emotions it's it's holistic so yeah absolutely I agree that there is there is there is some good in that it you know representation is important and so. You know a young gay person might not feel alone because they see something on shit's Creek but then I think. You know if it was it was you know my son or my daughter I would all who was who is. You know discovering these feelings attraction store the same sex I would then want to have the conversations like well but also like that is not going to lead you to true happiness and true fulfillment so. And I think that provides I mean yet that caveat aside that there's brokenness and many other relationships in this show there's maybe by accident maybe by common grace there's some deep deeply beautiful things that some of these relationships are getting up. I think getting at our need to to be loved and to believe or love a bull. Yes. The importance of of like platonic friendship. So so for example a way that kind of I felt really touched by this show was David and Patrick's relationship a particularly kind of this Patrick character he. It's really a little for me and maybe many of us listening to the show because we grew up in a church where we didn't think we could share about this part of our story so maybe he's dated in the closet for a long time. And Patrick this character basically seems to have been in the closet has been hiding his sexuality until he meets David this you know out of town or city guy. And there's a touching way that David makes it safe for Patrick to share more of who he is and find deep friendship. Now I don't think that has to then end in romance and sex. And that is where their friendship goes. But I just I want to know I want to notice that there's a lot of good in creating space safe space for other people to share. This part of their story and have deep free friendship around that that shared awareness. Yes, and if our church is not a safe place and if our spiritual leaders are not safe people that they can go to. Where do you think where do you think people are going to go they're going to go to where they experience acceptance right and I think that was that was the lesson of Jesus right Jesus went to the tax collectors house he went to the prostitutes and it's scandalized people how dare could you hang out with them how care dare could you have dinner with them how dare could you eat food from a tax collector who's exploiting the people like just that guilt by association. And but you know the encounter comes before repentance like there is a call to repentance there is a call to a different way of life. But the encounter in the love comes first and I think so many in our church are getting that backwards like okay gay person we will love you if you only call your sex self same sex attracted you only you know you know don't talk about it too much you there's there's and and. If you grow up as a gay person you get that message loud and clear in a lot of our churches and. Yeah, I think you posted something the other day on your social media that our churches need to be places where. A celibate queer Christians are thriving because of their not thriving in our churches they can't thrive anywhere and if we expect and we call. queer Christians to live by this traditional sexual ethic. But we don't provide a space for them we don't provide a welcome for them they're not thriving in our church like what what do we where we expect they're going to go so. Yeah. Yeah and I think a key to that is finding deep meaningful friendship. I'm maybe I'm not called a spiritual friendship and we see these kind of spiritual friendships in the stories of David Jonathan and Ruth and Naomi and Jesus and John and Paul and Timothy and scripture and I mean I see some of that in the show too I mean you talked about David and. And Steve's friendship. Yeah. And it's really interesting what goes on there because they they thought at first of what they wanted was sex and romance. It almost because that's the narrative from our culture is the most me of a ways to connect our sex and romance and then as a as a as a relation as a people in relationship with each other they kind of realized we don't want sex and romance. We want a deep friendship. Yeah. We want to be best friends. And and and in some ways for a lot of the show. Steven David's friendship is just as important as any romantic relationship that Stevie or David are in with other people. So so I will say it's difficult then when later in the show. It seems like it it it portrays that David and Patrick's relationship becomes more meaningful the David's friendship with Stevie. Yeah. Can I ask you about and oh sorry. I go ahead and I was going to ask you about two things so you've you've talked about one. You know queer Christians will queer people people in general like we need meaningful friendships and some people that that I've talked to would look at something like you're doing with the national national family of brothers is that would you call it. Yeah. Yeah. The national family of brothers and they would say well that's not a smart idea that's a near occasion of sin that's a good. That's a good idea of sin that's like you know putting that that's just setting people up to fail. And you know like I think some people look at you know to to gay men or to gay women having a close friendship almost as impossible just like some people say it's impossible for a male and a man and a woman to really be friends something is when Harry met Sally something will always be sexually attracted like what do you have to say to that. Yeah, so I mean we definitely need to be wise we shouldn't be reckless. And I'll also point out that in the national family of brothers it's not just a community for many who are gay for many of experience same since attraction. We've got men discerning and and and interested in taking next steps with our community. With a variety of experiences and stories and sexual orientation so. So I think brotherhood like this should reflect the diversity within the body of Christ including we need to have people in our community who don't experience same sex attraction. Yeah, so. But you know I think a lot of this is about. Meeting our intimacy needs and healthy ways so if someone believes that as humans we have to have sex or romance to be whole people. And it makes sense that you would doubt whether someone could be celibate and in an intimate community with people they might be attracted to and can could continue to be faithful. Yeah, but what do we see Jesus living a life of celibacy. Being the fulfillment of what it means to be truly and fully human. Yeah, never had sex or romance. And what do we destined for in the new heaven and new earth in the new Jerusalem where where creation will be fulfilled. It's a place without sex romance marriage or bearing any new children. So I think both of those have got to tell us that we don't need sex or romance to be whole Christians. Yeah, it's a good thing. It's necessary on this side of the new heaven's in the new earth. Yes, some people in our churches absolutely. But that it's very possible with God's grace to to to to be to be celibate and to meet our intimacy needs in a healthy ways with that. Healthy ways without romance or sex. Yes, that means then is that we don't have an inherent need for romance or sex. We just have needs for emotional and spiritual and intellectual and physical intimacy that can be met in a romantic or sexual relationship. But also can be met just with our relationship with God and with platonic friendships and with family with other celibate people. And so I think it's a lot of it is it's about rightly ordered desires. Proactively and first meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways with friendship. And then I find that I don't really have a desire. I don't find the temptation to engage in same sexual or romantic activity. Yeah. Very powerful. If I have been actively meeting my needs for for intimacy in healthy ways. Yes, in the recent past. And and that's not just for people who are living celibacy. I can tell you it was like, man, with lots of married friends. If you don't have that intimacy with God, if you don't have healthy expectations for intimacy with your wife or husband. If you don't have good friendships, it's just as easy to to feel lonely and to let that drag you into sexual sins like pornography or adultery or all sorts of stuff. Like getting married does not solve that loneliness. It does not solve those issues. We did an episode on that that Justin Bieber song Holy. And with my friend Brian Greenfield and we we mashed it up with that Ariana Grande song positions and he he was talking about is like, what do you think is harder? Cell of the sea or marriage. And I was like, oh, that's a good question. And he said they're both equally impossible only with God's grace. Can you live with your vocation? Well. And yeah, so I think a lot of people think, oh, get married and that it maybe they don't say this out loud because it sounds dumb when you say it out loud, but it's an internal belief that if I get this thing, you know, just like wealth, right? We love the giver. We love the gift over the giver and the gift of a spouse who can become an idol. And we can think that's going to fulfill our needs for intimacy. And it may in some healthy ways, but it's not going to do it entirely. We still need good friendships. We still need a relationship of God the Father. So I think that in that is a great lesson that people like you who are committed to self-obs Seeing and living self-dissee are like a prophetic signpost for us married people saying that this is not your idol. This is not your ultimate happiness pointing to the new heavens in the new earth pointing to the life to come that there is something more and that's where we will ultimately be fulfilled. So yeah, my next question was going to be about self-hostly and you already went there. So I'm thankful for you at that. That was really good. Yeah. So we don't have a whole lot of time left. Was there anything about a shitskrieker just in general about what we've been talking about that you want to make sure you say before we're done? You know, I, there's, so a lot of this show where it begins and where it ends is this question of where is home. They're always trying to get out the family's always trying to get out of shit's creep and get back to their, their materially wealthy lives before that. Right. But in the meantime, what we see with this family over these seasons is they discover deeper experiences of friendship and family and meaning at this place where they think. Lacks anything worthwhile deeper meaning in friendship and connection and belonging than they'd ever experienced before. Yeah. And so I think it's really disappointing when the conclusion of the show is that most of them leave. Yeah. When they finally get, when they finally get their ticket out, that doesn't fall through because so many of the seasons. It's a further season's end with I think they're going to get out and I don't, you know. But it's what's sad the way that it ends is is many of them leave and I think there's just. As someone who's who's been considering what to do with my singleness and does that mean I'm available to move anywhere and go anywhere and do anything. Actually, I've realized that God, I think, is called me to stay. And in many ways because the only way to to benefit from the ways you've invested and in your local church and in your friendships with people outside of your home, your immediate family. And the only way to stay connected to your extended family is to stay where you are. Yeah. Even if there's less culture where you are, there's less job opportunities where you are, there's less marriage projects where you are, there's less opportunities for status and power where you are. You're going to lose something when you leave. Yeah, that's true. And I just, I think that's on display in a big way in this show is is they moved to shit's creek where they thought they'd find nothing. They actually discovered deep relationship and belonging. And in the end, they were willing to trade it away for more jobs. Yeah. More status, more power, more money and I don't think that trades worth it. I don't think it was worth it for the roses in this fictional shit's creek TV show. I don't think it's worth it for a lot of us Americans. Yeah. I think it would be better for many of us to stay where we are. Oh, man. You're going to get me in trouble preaching that Jesus stuff. But I agree. I agree. I mean, that's, yeah, it's not a worldly, I think following the path of Jesus, like it's going to be at contradiction with like what the world says is success is happiness. But it's so much sweeter. So yeah. Thank you so much. So I often ask my guests if they would close us in a prayer kind of reflecting on the themes that we've talked about. Would you feel comfortable leading a prayer for us in our listeners? Yeah, sure. Awesome. So listeners, wherever you are, let's take a moment and we're going to pray. Hey, God shows like shit's creek, a real mind to us that there are good things like cars and homes and pretty close and nice vacations that you've made and you've made possible for us that can be really good. But sometimes those things can distract us from what we're really made for. We're made to worship and serve and connect with you God. We're made to enjoy human intimacy with other image bearers in the context of of of of family that reminds us of of what's true about your love God in the Trinity in between Christ and the church. We're made to labor to bring about wholeness and healing in this world in creation. And the pleasures of this world can sometimes distract us, can trick us into thinking that those things were we're really made for our what will most deeply satisfy us. So so I pray God, you would you would show us in our lies in the coming days and weeks. And weeks what the true deeper things are that you've called us to and the God if it's necessary that you would maybe withdraw from us some of the some of the distracting pleasures so that we could learn to love the giver more than the gifts and Jesus name we pray. And then father son, who has spirit and then thank you Peter well that was a that's a gutsy prayer. Giving God permission to withdraw some things that's who I don't I don't know let's feel like I have the faith to say that prayer but that's that's that's heavy. So thank you thank you so much.
