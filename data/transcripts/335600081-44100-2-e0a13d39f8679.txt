 Researchers show that 96% of individuals who participate in sexual orientation change efforts don't experience any change in their sexual orientation. Welcome to the political animals. I'm your host Jonathan Cole, I'm a scholar, writer and translator who specializes in political theology, the intersection of religion and politics. Joining me all the way from Nashville is Peter Volk, who is the founder and director of a quip, a consulting ministry aimed at helping churches to be places where gay and LGBT Christians can thrive in line with the church's traditional and historical sexual ethic. Volk should say Peter, we don't have to be that formal, he's also the founder of the family of brothers, an organization aimed at fostering family and community among men called to vocational singleness. He has studied at Gordon-Conville Theological Seminary with a focus on lay leadership and culture making and he also holds a master's in clinical mental health counseling from Lipscomb University. Peter, a very warm welcome to the show. Thanks for having me, I'm glad to be here. Okay, Peter, why don't we begin with a quip? What is a quip? How did it come into existence? What is it all about? Yeah, so a quip is a Christian consulting ministry and we engage in long-term partnerships with churches that hold a historic sexual ethic and help them embody that in their discipleship and their programming and their public teaching in ways that lead to thriving in the lives of LGBT plus people. And a lot of churches aren't good at that yet and so there's a lot of work to be done in terms of helping them teach and and disciple on program around that well. So we I guess we got this work got started in 2014. In many ways, we're not a kind of my own experience of being a gay Christian committed to a historic sexual ethic and sharing my story in college and and getting to know other people who had the same story and convictions in all of us realizing that none of us, none of us, had parents or pastors who knew how to care for us well. And so when I graduated college and felt kind of a calling from the Lord to start or to be a part of a ministry that is a quipping parents and pastors to better love and serve gay people. I suggest to that call and and then looked around for ministries that were doing that back in 2014 and there were none doing that kind of locally or regionally from where I was located in Nashville, Tennessee and and even nationally there were no organizations at the time that were the focusing on that. And so just felt a call from the Lord to start that work to start a quipping back in 2014 and then we've learned a lot since then about what the need of the church is and the best way to address it. So yeah that's a bit about a quipping how we got started and what we're doing today. So I suppose for the benefit of listeners, some might be wondering what you mean by historic teaching could you flesh out a little bit or what is your perspective in terms of what the Bible does or doesn't say about sex and sexuality and all that kind of stuff. Yeah so for us when we use the phrase historic sexual I think we use that to mean that the God's best for every Christian is either vocational singleness which is a lifetime vocation of abstinence singleness for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention or Christian marriage which is a lifetime vocation of marriage between one Christian woman and one Christian man with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom. And yeah we believe that's God's best for every Christian including LGBT plus people like me. So those that's kind of and there's obviously more we can get more into the details of different questions of theology but that's at a top level. Yeah what work convinced us. Yeah and what's your own ecclesiolo denomational background out of interest? Yeah I'm an Anglican I'm actually in the process of the coming adeacon and the Anglican church in North America. Yeah okay cool. But I would say for reference for your audience a lot of Anglicans particularly conservative Anglicans in Australia seem to be more reformed more Calvinist and I would say I am decidedly not Calvinist not reformed. I mean reformed in the broadest sense like of the reformation but not reformed in the Calvinist sense so I would say I'm actually much more Anglic Catholic than I am anything else. Okay what we would call high church do you use that terminology there? Yeah but I would say high church less to do with the aesthetics. Okay and what's to do with the theology that like Catholic social teaching is what I find most convincing and Catholics theology of kind of agency and free will and all those kinds of things. It's the Catholic theology that I'm drawn to not necessarily the bells and smells as they say. The bells as well. It's such an interesting because in the Australian context and it's probably worth clarifying this because as I was telling you just before we started rolling about 80% of my audiences in Australia the Anglic Catholic not exclusively but overwhelmingly is liberal and it's theology in Australia. This is just like one diocese that is or at least was conservative enough for example to not ordained women which is generally the Sydney Evangelical Anglican position but in the I mean if you the sort of sexual ethic you just outlined is decidedly not one I would put in the liberal theological cap. The kind of view say of homosexuality or find in your every Anglic Catholic parish in Australia is going to be much more progressive shall we say. In fact that's this is the issue that's dividing Anglicanism in Australia because there are parts of the Anglican Church at that Anglicathic end that want to for example have services to bless same-sex marriages and do stuff like that. That is that kind of binary in Australia is a bit more complex in the US or how it, how it, yeah it does land differently in the US. So I would say that the mainline denominations in the US and the branches of mainline Protestants in the US that hold a more revisionist sexual ethic tend not to be very high church they tend to be much more casual actually. And then at the same time kind of more kind of culturally conservative and theological conservative evangelicals tend to also have a more casual church experience. And then kind of a particularly in the Anglican context Anglic Catholics tend to be people who are theologically conservative and are more convinced of kind of generally a Catholic kind of theological regimen than they are a Protestant theological regimen on a lot of questions. And then yes like the smells and bells and kind of the aesthetic aspects of the church they're drawn into. I think part of what goes with that is it is also a belief that kind of the the authority of the church to help us interpret scripture and for the parishioner to kind of submit to the wisdom of the historic church. So for a lot of those who identify as Anglic Catholic, part of that is they also appeal to the great tradition. They see themselves as connected to the global consensus among Catholics and Eastern Orthodox and Anglicans in Africa and in that sense are identifying as Anglican. Mixed all of a sense because when we talk when you put the two terms together Anglic Catholic it's easy certainly in the Australian Anglican context to forget that Catholic ranges from very conservative like Catholicism from very conservative to progressive. So you can't assume this you shouldn't assume that just because someone is looking towards Catholicism which is kind of what you're talking about where there's a kind of Catholic theology in an Anglican context for one of the better terms. Of course that could go in a number of different directions. But we do not need that was a bit of a side track because I think the easiest thing to think about is like instead of Anglic Catholic meaning not conservative Anglic Catholic in America at least means not to lip. Yeah, to lip is the acronym for the kind of five major tenants of Calvinism. Yeah, totally good gravity unlimited you know what yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Anglicat look in America just means we don't believe in tulip. Yeah okay. Americans very good at breaking things down into a nice, digestible and tangible I haven't heard that before let's do interesting. Anyway it's like it's always we're getting on to Anglicanism. I kind of wish now you had it just said Southern Baptist or something because the Anglicanism is such a peculiar beast in Australia. So anyway we had to do a bit of a contextualizing I would like to just before we get on to the churches which once or lack of response it's trying some failures when it comes to dealing with LGBT Christians that's that that's the tension point really because sometimes there's this idea that they're outside the church and it's this kind of divide but it's actually and I and I actually say this sometimes to non-Christian friends that because I think it's lost in the secular way you do realize how many gay Christians there are so this this thing that is supposed to be the most oppressive thing for gay people somehow is attracting yeah gay people but I just said that's not where I was going to go but we walk from back to that gradually I think it was just worth teasing out a bit of your own theology because you've got a unique perspective here as a gay Christian adhering who believes in the historic Christian teaching on sexual ethics so I don't know if this is the right term but I feel like I want to use it and I'm just fascinated here what you say I mean what is a theology of homosexuality is there such a thing what like how do you explain same sex attraction within the Bible all of the great doctrines from creation to eschatology or right I mean that's probably setting up for to be a thing but for someone who hasn't thought seriously about this specific topic and I don't know and tour my I'm sure a lot of my listeners don't know what what is a way of theologically understanding the phenomenon of same sex attraction yeah so I think the way the the church kind of obviously I'm going to offer this with more nuanced than like a pastor or priest would have offered this 200 years ago but but but it seems like ultimately this is what's within that this is what the church has as understood historically and even if we look at before the pray the gay way of movement particularly in the states if we look at how CS Lewis and Frances Sheafer and Billy Graham were speaking about homosexuality they were speaking about it in the ways that I'm about to share and so what I'm sharing is not necessarily I think isn't when we think about what the church has taught and believed historically I don't think we should associate pray the gay way of theology with that okay pray the gay way of theology is actually a modern false theology it's not a biblical theology it is a fundamentalist anti-biobal theology so so yeah but instead historically I think the church has understood that you know experience that same sex attractions are are not what got intended that they're they're a brokenness that they're a product of the fall that they're just kind of one of the ways that people are affected by all of the brokenness of the world you know I don't believe in God first imagined me and imagine me being born into a perfect world with a perfect body he didn't imagine me developing same sex attractions but but I what I was born into a broken world and and I mean none of us are how God meant for us to be all of us are corrupted at a genetic level or in perfectly in our in our mother's womb are are born into a broken world that injures us countless times before we ever gain agency so none of us are how God intended us to be but I want to be clear that like while experiencing same sex attraction may not be what God intended it may be a temptation to same sex actual activity same sex romantic activity it's not a sin to be tempted it's not a sin to merely experience same sex attraction I don't think God sends people to hell merely because boys like boys or girls like girls that's not how it works um he doesn't hold or kind of involuntary desires against us um so but but and I don't think we choose who we're attracted to either the consensus of scientists is that people develop their sexual orientation through a combination of nature and nurture a combination of genetic factors and environmental factors but we have no idea what those environmental and biological factor contributors are exactly we have a little bit of more of a sense with the genetic contributors might be but but still not fully pinpointed but but that's to say that you know the for example the the born gay or choose to be gay dichotomy I think scientific research can pretty definitively reject both of those we neither choose our sexual orientation we don't choose who we experience robust enduring attraction toward nor are we born genetically determined to develop a particular sexual orientation so we not neither born gay nor choose to be gay but but we do choose how we respond we do choose what we do with our sexual desires how we steward them but I also want to be clear and as I've already hinted at that that I think sexual orientation change efforts are harmfully ineffective researchers show that 96% of individuals who participate in sexual orientation change effort don't experience any change in their sexual orientation and then the same research found that that participating in sexual orientation change efforts increases the person's likelihood of suicide attempt by 92% so harmfully ineffective so does God have the power to to change anything about this world and about us certainly but but it seems like God chooses very infrequently to answer people's prayers for sexual orientation change and it seems like the the spiritual and psychological costs of pursuing sexual orientation change far away the the infrequent benefits so so where does that leave the gay Christian where does that leave someone like me I have this enduring brokenness that it seems consistently as not God's will to change in a certain way but instead I feel like God invites me to ask him how is he going to use my enduring persisting and brokenness for my good and for his glory how is he asking me to faithfully steward that and do I trust him that that faithfully stewarding that will lead to actually the the most belonging and the greatest purpose and the deepest meaning in this lifetime and so yeah so so I believe that there's no context for same sexual activity that God blesses inscripture and and and you know each every time the Bible does talk about same sexual activity it calls it a sin granted it's within kind of limited context so there's this very reasonable arguments that people could make about you know if we only looked at the the club or passages as people refer to them are they convincing but for me what's much more convincing is the whole of scripture what it says God's best is when Christians are stewarding their sexual realities and I mean and we even don't have to look much further than Matthew 19 and Jesus' words where he is correcting God's people for becoming too lacks on his standard for marriage and is saying listen you're getting people permission for divorce willy nilly and this is not what God intended God intended for marriage but to be between a man and a woman and to be for a lifetime and to there to be very few circumstances under what you divorce and then his audience found that to be crazy and then they suggested that it would be better to you know bring social shame on themselves and be celibate and bear in for a lifetime then be stuck with someone in marriage for a lifetime and then Jesus says well actually I want to introduce a new idea and that is that it actually could be good it could be very good for some Christians to accept a calling to lifetime abstinence singleness for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention so yeah so that's what I believe it's God's best is in Jesus' words are those two things Christian marriage of a certain design and vocational singleness of a certain design and and as a believer I don't want to settle for anything less than God's best so yeah that's kind of maybe that's not as brief as as you were looking for but that's a that's kind of how I conceptualize same sex attraction and yeah yeah well brief in the context of a long form podcast sure he's sort of long gotten brief in a 20 minute it's kind of relative in a way I'm interested that was really interesting what you said earlier about the pray the gay away movement and what I just want to clarify because I I gather from what you said that you do think it is possible for someone's sexuality to be changed but that that's more like a miracle rather than a systematic thing like a product like a Henry Ford production factory where you can just put all the gay Christians through it and they all pop out like alcoholics and non-assaults or something where they all felt when you are pure is that kind of way that I can see way that like God could supernaturally change my hair colors would permanently blonde without me ever needing hair dye again if I ask him he's unlikely to and certainly probably people who are you know ginger is for example and pray that God would let them not be a ginger but yeah but yes in very infrequent it's a miracle and we God says we can pray for miracles yeah but I think any responsible pasture would say it is not spiritually wise to assume a miracle will happen and build your understanding of God's goodness on the expectation that a miracle will happen that's right and you can't you can't base your pastoral care on the miracle right you have to be open to it you have you have to have something for when and if the miracle doesn't occur yeah yeah and I think there comes a time where spending a lot of time in energy and focus asking for a miracle may become a distraction from just being present to your life today yeah and and I find with my counseling clients it's it's it's helpful for them to eventually move on from praying that prayer yeah is that out of interest is that a common prayer uh sort of early on in the gay Christians journey when they come to terms of their sexuality yeah and I think and I don't think that's just if people grow up in a conservative context um I mean there's like there's been a recent movie in the states uh and the title was love Simon and um and the as best you can tell with the context of the movie and again it's it's a fictional space but uh is that the the the family as not people they're not people of faith uh there's no kind of suggestion that the main character grew up in some culturally or theologically or spiritually conservative space yeah he still hesitates to share his story he still wishes that he wasn't gay because teens no teen wants to be different right yeah yeah um and and then I think if you're a Christian and you don't want to be different and if you've ever read the scriptures and read with the scriptures seem to say just on their face about this then you definitely don't want to be gay and then if you grow up in a even if you grew up in a concert a Christian context that maybe teaches a historic sexual ethic in a in a um in a careful compassion away I think a teen who realizes that this is a part of their story was still wish it just be simple or if it wasn't you know yeah and certainly if a teen grows up in a in a space that kind of teaches a version of pray the gay away in a director interact way than then they're going to kind of default to to those prayers yeah yeah indeed it's it's interesting just picking up on some of the other things he said that um this really for whatever reason perhaps a complex historical reasons perhaps there was some historical theological reasons cultural reasons you know same sexual traction really is treated differently people react differently to it because all those things when you're outlining the theology also applied to heterosexual so yeah singerness is a vocation for a woman a female Christian who's not married or a heterosexual male who's not married that is the sexual ethic that we're talking about here it's actually no different there and of course there's a long history in the church of uh celibacy in the priesthood there's hall the home monastic movement and and of course that point you made that you know everyone's a sinner we're all born into a world of sin and no one's blame us sure so even if you thought same sex attraction was a sin and I don't think I agree with you just I don't think just the attraction is a sin um um even if that that even if you did think that well that's everyone in your church whether I'm sure you or um gay so the question is why do you think this particular attribute or I'm not sure what the best language is he why is this treated as such a threat such a danger such a a particular sin that sort of makes it rise above all kinds of others and of and of course you look at conservative Christian circles there have been some spectacular heterosexual um sexual failings right up in in leadership we will know the story of the the past that being the secretary or whatever you know and to be fair that's that's never really condone but there is a even a there's either not even a path of rehabilitation for the heterosexual church leader to come back but of course some people act like just the presence of the same sex Christian is somehow worse than the the past of that's actually nice and glorious sin yeah I think um I think a lot of it I think a lot of it in leasing the states can goes back to the um the AIDS crisis and the ways that Christians responded to the AIDS crisis and at first kind of were really earnestly trying to be helpful but offered a lot of the wrong solutions and created this um this way of thinking about homosexuality that was just really off so uh and a great book on this topic is still time to care like reg johnson and in it I think in a really in a way that he is is factual but also kind of empathetic towards even maybe some elements that we would generally find problematic but but he's trying to kind of see it through their eyes in the timeline um recognizes that when what happened in the in the in the 80s and in the AIDS crisis at least in the states is there was a lot of gay people who are calling or showing up to churches and just saying I'm afraid to die I don't want to die can you help me and it's not like these churches and responded in the park but not like yes let's us now at least pray the gay away on them you're right it's that they just saw all these people who needed help and they didn't know what to do and all these pastors were calling around their pastor friends and saying hey I've got a bunch of gay people who want help I don't know how to help them what do I do and somehow a lot of those people got got in their hands these kind of these cassette tapes from kind of a pray the gay away more charismatic small organization out in California and those kind of got spread around everywhere and also never church was offering a version of pray the gay away as the solution to the threat of AIDS and the possibly of death because of AIDS and um and and and then and then kind of just there was a snowball effect of that just continue to roll and develop and even when maybe people have knew that some point in their gut that people don't choose who they are attracted to there's there's no way to make a gay person straight that's not how this works but they sold that solution um and that idea to people for decades and they sold it to straight people too right that's how they taught straight people to think about homosexuality that if people are gay it's because they want to be gay if people are if people really believe in God's word and they didn't want to be engaging in same sexual activity then they would just choose not to be gay and there's same sexual attractions would go away and they would have heter they would have opposite sex attractions exclusively and it would be solved so if anyone has enduring same sex attractions it's because they want to disobey God's word that and that was just what was taught to straight people at least in the states for decades and so that and then it gets mixed in with politics in the 90s and the 2000s at least in the states and it becomes a wedge issue and so um yeah there's we we we falsely educate kind of straight people theologically about how to think about gay people and then we use as a political football and both of those um just at least in the states like supercharged the the way that we were what did these things differently you do like to supercharge issues I have to say yes that's the only one for the Australian but I mean you you you what what have you find in America you will you will also find some extent in Australia just a bit more attenuated and often smaller but that's really interesting because I I guess you can see how through that particular experience and response I mean some ways you could say well it's a it's a reflexive response that may be if it been well-intentioned initially or in many cases but it stems out of a lack of being equipped or really having thought through the issue properly it's a kind of instinctual response and so that helped me understand that in a way then you can treat the same sex you can start to think of the same sex attraction as unrep- as a consequence an unrepentant attitude because if you assume that it's something that the individual could solve on their own with just a bit of willpower then you can start to treat it as a kind of that that's what takes you out of that what should unify everyone that we're all broken we're all in need of forgiveness we all need to repent and like Donald Trump and so on others who have lived a perfect life apparently but yeah that that gets you out of that paradigm that does become theologically I think quite distorted and perhaps those particularly heterosexuals that have that attitude don't realize at a more deeper level how it's out of culture with co-ded doctrines like raw sinners you know the four and and the like the yeah and I at least in least in the states I think it also connects with like charismatic theology more broadly and this and kind of a in some ways more broadly like an idea that of progress that that we can escape brokenness that we can escape pain and we just need to build good enough machines and accrue enough resources and have smart enough solutions and that's not that's you know that's just just generally like Americans believe that we can we can fix that yeah we can fix it and so optimistic people yes for bear for worse and so I think where that interest into like least American Christianity is everyone wants to believe that we can just ask out for things in he'll fix everything there is not a robust theology of suffering and of it's of seeing and honoring the reality of brokenness generally in the American church and then particularly in charismatic churches there's this promising that well if you are really faithful God will really answer your prayers as you the in the ways that you've asked and so I think some of it is also the the straight people in the 80s and 90s and 2000s who kind of were taught to think about gay people in this certain way it's because it also fit with the ways they were thinking about themselves that if they put the same thing on themselves that they had some kind of brokenness in their own life that they ought to pray for God to remove it and God would if they were praying faithfully enough so it's a part of that bigger problem of kind of how we were thinking about enduring brokenness and suffering and it's just it's just a lack of a lot of America's lack of capacity to suffer to suffer well. That's a really interesting comment maybe not on it if it was a different podcast I might unpack that a bit but you said something really interesting there because that that makes me think that you could say that really this particular response in the 80s and 90s to homosexuality isn't really about homosexuality it's that that was gay Christians or even non gay Christians seeking help crying out for help at the you know entrance to a church or whatever were collateral damage of a more pervasive theological distortion that's a particularly American in a way it reflects the American temperament you could say and culture of the time. Yeah whereas in contrast what Frances Schaefer and CS Lewis and Billy Graham were saying in the decades before that was yeah there are gay people and it doesn't seem like there's a way to make gay people not gay people and so if they're Christians what that looks like it's for them to daily resist temptation and say no to opportunities to engage in same sexual activity and our churches need to be places where they can share their stories and they don't have to hide their struggles and where they can find family and support in the body of Christ to daily steward their sexualities and God honoring ways as all of us are daily resisting temptations and now that's not an easy solution right that's a solution saying okay just like all the rest of us every day we're going to have to battle with temptation but that was the answer you know before the AIDS crisis but but when there was this huge wave of people looking for help who were looking for it many ways quick solutions easy solutions if what you told them was well daily you have to do these mental and and spiritual exercises to keep your soul well for the rest of your life people weren't interested in that solution that's too hard yeah so we're kind of into the yeah sorry we might look like we're already but let's talk about the contemporary church response because I was really interested that you said I think that a quick you started a quick in 2014 after you received a call to go into a specific type of ministry and you looked to find that ministry and you couldn't find it anywhere so 2014 that's only what I've got to do I was on a never-good at maths at school that's what nine years yeah go so what I'd be right in assuming that then and perhaps still now would you say the church wasn't doing a particularly good job I guess the pray the gay way thing was still um looming large at least in America and I'm guessing to just ignorance because I think well put it this way I think back to my upbringing and Dolls Race in sort of Evangelical Anglican circles and Dolls Race with that kind of biblical sexual ethic the historic one you're talking about and I never met a gay Christian throughout my entire youth at least one who put the hand up and said because in that era and this is before even in secular society now yeah still pretty costly to come out in the 80s and 90s I gather because I was a reflected on the podcast before I finished high school I think in 1994 there wasn't a single open leguey person in my graduating class of year 12 in 1994 and that was in Melbourne which Australians will know is the most progressive city the most LGBTQ friendly city today so you know when I look back it's like okay what was the church doing then I wouldn't have the faintest clue because no one ever talked about the issue no one and I understand it was brave enough to come out because Jews they probably would have been rejected I'm guessing yeah so it is the church that I guess church we've got you know there are have also been the church which is where there are openly gay people in relationships that are in the population yeah so there's of course there's a spectrum and maybe we'll come to the liberal end theologically at some point because it's been interesting to know how you respond to that but this is probably just the world's most longest preamble towards our asking the world's simplest question which is how is that side of the church that teaches the traditional sexual ethic how is it currently managing the issue what's the bad and ugly here right so yeah the a lot of the pre the gay away ministries kind of collapsed in the early 2010 or early to the late 2000s excuse me I was that kind of stay with failing yeah because they were starting to not to be the the reality that sexual orientation changed doesn't happen frequently was becoming unavoidable and and and a lot of the leaders of those pre the gay away ministries were also getting caught in scandal or admitting that they had not actually experienced sexual orientation changed themselves and lost credibility and so all of that kind of imploded and those were the spaces that were both kind of receiving people from church we're sending gay people to those ministries to get help and so that was the way that churches were fixing the problem dealing with the problem but also churches were kind of learning from those ministries what if they wanted to teach parents how to how to respond or think about homosexuality they would bring those ministries into teach them so when those ministries imploded there was just nothing churches had no idea how to think about this or how to offer pastoral care around it and that it increasingly became kind of a a politically contentious thing and so a lot of churches just silence avoidance let's just not talk about it and let's avoid it as long as we can that's how most churches in the states responded for a while and and so yeah recently there's in the past kind of five to ten years there's been some new ministries that have started that kind of that aren't pray the gay away but also aren't a revisionist sexual ethic and and I would say are more grounded in compassionate historic Christian teaching on sexual ethics but yeah this still I would say most churches who there's a big chunk in the middle of churches who maybe hold privately hold a compassionate historic sexual ethic but our silent on the topic because they are afraid and for a lot of them because they've been silent for many years their congregation is now full of people who have different opinions on this topic and so now there would be a great cost if they brought the topic back up and clarified what their church believes there would be a lot of donors who would leave so there's that kind of risk there and then on both extremes there's churches that still loudly teach a pray the gay away theology and there's churches that that loudly preach kind of a revisionist sexual ethic but the most churches in the states that seems or somewhere somewhere in the middle of those two and and silent unfortunately yeah and in that time since your ministry began have other ministry streets trying to address this particular issue a reason as well like the ministry's growing or the resources and people working on it still far below what is required for the number of churches and more specifically gay Christians who require some support yeah there there are others so so there was one ministry it was called lead them home it's now called posture shift that existed before I started a quip and they were doing kind of a different thing than then I felt like out was calling me to do but they've existed before but from but before 2014 I'm not sure when they got started and then a couple years after I started a quip the the center for faith sexuality in gender was established by presence wrinkle and then I think a year or two after that the Revoiced conference started meeting and so those are kind of some of the kind of most kind of prominent most active ministries and organizations doing this kind of work so what what is it that gay Christians require pastorally that might be specific can you make or the in particular heterosexual Christians might not understand or be aware of yeah so one I think I think it's important for churches to recognize the ways that Christians have have hurt gay people in the past we need we need to confess the sins of the church in the past and and you don't have to abandon a historic sexual ethic to do that but I think it is it is it is right practice to recognize the ways that we taught kind of falls pretty the way the way the way the way the theology is the led to great loss of faith and loss of life and that that is not God's solution that's not God's wisdom and the ways that we told gay people that that that that that we police what language that used to describe themselves or we taught falsely that merely experiencing same sex attraction is a sin we need to confess those things I think that's a good start I think that you know most of the gay people I know prefer to go to a church that's really clear about their beliefs on sexual ethics now my friends you hold a more revision of sexual ethic they want to go to a church that exclusively teaches a revision of sexual ethic and my friends who hold a historic sexual ethic want to go to a church that exclusively teaches a historic sexual ethic but we want to be in churches that are clear and so one thing I think is interesting about that actually is that it's it's my straight friends who prefer a church that doesn't talk about sexual ethics and just heard the church that sits the fence on this conversation because they don't want to be made uncomfortable they don't want to be made to have to choose but but but that's not what gay people want that fence sitting hurts gay people it's it's it's the benefit of straight people I understand but it's but whenever a church is is fence sitting and being silent on this topic it's not for the benefit of gay people it's for the benefit of straight people and so I think instead clarity is is really important and then I think maybe this is pretty obvious but but the church needs to make sure that like leaders and parents have the pastoral care skills they need to walk alongside LGBT plus people instead of instead of setting LGBT plus people after therapists or pray the gay way of ministries like our churches need to be places where LGBT plus people can make sense of their stories among the people that they worship with and take communion with and study the scriptures with right so I think that and then I'd say there's three like blind spots for a lot of churches that I think are also addressing these blind spots are the keys to better LGBT plus ministry particularly according to a historic sexual ethic so I think one of those blind spots is that a lot of churches wait until someone comes out to talk about God's love and wisdom for LGBT plus people but that's problematic because most teens wait an average of five years tell a parent or pastor that they're gay that's five years that those teens are making sense of their sexuality alone in the closet without the love and wisdom of their parents it left alone with the lies of the enemy and culture and the closet is really it's it's a trauma like being in the closet leads to loneliness anxiety shame depression sexual sin addiction abandoning God's wisdom suicide loss of faith like it is just it is no good and I'll say it's like a licensed professional counselor who myself who meets with gay Christians committed to a historic sexual ethic these lingering wounds of the closet are usually the greatest barrier to them thriving you know like this this haunts them for a lifetime so so one of the best ways we can then care for gay people in our churches is to make sure that the kids share with parents as soon as they notice same sex attractions or gender incongruence and then in doing so we can prevent these wounds of the closet from ever happening and then and then hopefully leading to a lifetime of thriving according to God's wisdom but but for kids to share early about their sexuality for them to hear about God's love and wisdom before puberty parents need coaching and encouragement to do that well right parents have no idea how to have those conversations with their kids in age and appropriate ways and so so I think one thing our church need to be doing is equipping parents to lead their kids in those conversations in age appropriate ways so this is the first blind spot instead of instead of kind of enabling the wounds of the closet by waiting to talk about God's love and wisdom for gay people we need to protect kids from the wounds of the closet prevent the wounds of the closet by talking about that reality in age appropriate ways a second blind spot that's really important for us to address is the the double standard for sexual stewardship the fact that you know many churches teach that that straight Christians you know let them assume that they will get married teach that we need romantic companionship to be happy ignore the Bible's teachings about vocational singleness and about divorce and then these same churches then call gay Christians to a higher standard of sexual stewardship and teach that gay Christians don't need romance or sex and gay Christians should should should should walk out vocational singleness and it'll be good for them and this yeah this inconsistent like hypocritical application of scripture it tempts a lot of sexual minorities to adopt a victim mentality and to reject sexual morality wisdom because of the double standard and I think churches lose the credibility to ask gay Christians to live according to biblical wisdom when they refuse to hold straight Christians accountable to that same wisdom but I but I also say that this this inconsistent standard hurts straight Christians as well like straight Christian marriages in the divorce at the same rate as non-Christian marriages and unmarried Christians are suffering from a lack of unmarried straight Christians are suffering from a lack of support in the church so so instead I think I think churches should be inviting everyone to to stew her their sexuality according to God's good and waiting wisdom and I think this might include examining whether straight Christians are engaging in casual romance and whether that's why it should include examining whether straight Christians are having sex outside of marriage whether they're making little or no progress from from from refraining from the use of pornography whether they're failing to consider vocational singleness whether they're unthinkingly refusing to to raise children for the sake of the kingdom whether they're engaging in unbiblical divorce and marriage those are all hard things to talk about you know but they're not any more difficult to talk about than than God's wisdom for gay people but I think if we raise the standard raise the bar for everyone's sexual stewardship we're going to eliminate that that discriminatory application of God's wisdom and ultimately prevent that that victim mentality and then the very last thing um the the the third blind spot is I think basically few of our churches are places where anyone can thrive in lifetime singleness regardless of sexual orientation yeah christian leaders don't teach about vocational singleness teens don't see vocational singals sing vocational singleness modeled or celebrated um and then and then too often I think single Christians regardless of sexual orientation either live with a revolving door of roommates and revolving door of small groups or they get tired of the pain of connecting and disconnecting and instead they just resolve to little um so I think instead our churches need to teach what the Bible has to say about vocational singleness our churches need to guide teens and young adults to discern whether they're called the vocational singleness or Christian marriage leading to many more stray people accepting a call to vocational singleness I think we need to hire vocational singles as leaders and pastors I think we need to celebrate people's commitments like callings and commitments to vocational singleness and then and I think most important um we need to ensure that vocational singals can find lifelong lived in family in the body of Christ by by helping them start intentional Christian communities and I think churches can can suggest the idea can help cast a vision for it can provide pastoral support why they explore that possibility can can co-shen through the process and and maybe even provide financial support but but yeah it's all yeah I'd say confess the sins of the church um offer clarity as charity make sure leaders know how to offer good pastoral care instead of sending people to is a pray the gateway ministries um prevent the wounds of the closet raise the bar for everyone's sexual stewardship and eliminate kind of that discriminatory double standard um and then make sure anyone who's walking out long-term or lifetime singleness is finding real family in the body of Christ I think that's I think that's the solution sounds like good recipe for a yeah flourishing a church the not an easy one but but a good one no not not easy and that like I have to say you know as a married heterosexual Christian I think for me a rossual awkwardness is the right word but let's not awkwardness it's just you're kind of and this may produce a bit of silence I think is your it's not that you feel guilty but you're enjoying an intimate lifetime partnership um and less face at Christians love conservative Christians love to celebrate marriage and the longer the marriage and the more kids you have the better is it it's a kind of hierarchy but you know you get to have sex and and then you it kind of like well even for the person who's very comfortable with the idea that you can be gay and be a Christian as I am you kind of feel like you know you it's not that you talk about double standard it's not a double standard because God doesn't do double standards but it's like there's and there's an unequalness there it feels like and you know I didn't come up with the rules myself and we can sort of theorize or theorize about why it is the case but I wonder if for some straight Christians they they do feel a little guilty and it's easier just not to do with gay people because of what we're asking you to do sure sure I'm mixed amidst a worshipping life where there are people who are married and have kids and have all that and I I am just conscious of what feels like in the inequity in a way I have to be honest yeah I get that like it it definitely at first glance it seems unfair and there are some real ways that it is unfair because of the ways that our churches have have embodied God's wisdom poorly that is real that is absolutely real and I think there's maybe some some imagined ways that it is unfair um it's also a few things about that one that I want to be clear that I don't think celibacy is the only option for gay Christians I know a lot of gay Christians who were were transparent about their sexuality in in college and afterward and also dated people of the opposite sex and were really honest with those people about their sexuality and they did not promise like oh if we get married I'm going to become straight or something they just said hey I'm I'm mostly gay but I'm also a little bit into people of the opposite sex and nothing's going to change about that but but I'm but I think you're cool uniquely specifically I'd like to get to know you better and people who who get married and have our in what's called a mixed orientation marriage and opposite sex marriage where they're one of the peers prisons have enduring same sex attractions and and they're honest about that reality of their marriage inside of their marriage and outside of their marriage they're entire time and they and all the marriages that I know of that kind enjoy healthy marital intimacy you know so it's not like their sexless marriages now there's a history of the perspective not just us is that common that that's really interesting that I haven't actually heard much about that particular phenomenon I think you called the mixed orientation mixed orientation marriages yeah is that very common I would say among my friends who are gay and Christian and hold a historic sexual ethic it's not the majority like I think more people are walking out cell embassies and they are in a mixed orientation marriage but it's I don't know if I had to put a number at it maybe it's like 15% okay interesting so it's not it's it's a non zero you know it's a meaningful number I mean I think one of the reasons why we don't talk about it in the church now is because for a long time when a gay person told a pastor I think I might be gay the pastor says don't tell anyone go marry someone of the opposite sex and then that will fix it and you'll just fall in love with them and your your your same sex attractions will go away and you never have to tell them don't tell your spouse that ended horribly horribly okay so that is not what in any way what I'm suggesting here I'm suggesting full transparency from the beginning of the dating relationship clear expectation that same sex attractions will endure for a lifetime that something that'll make sense of together as a as a couple but yeah there's people who do that so so so technically you know both Christian marriage and vocational singleness are open to to gay people but but there are plenty of gay people who just could never imagine themselves married to someone of the opposite sex and for them it doesn't really feel like there's two options so and I want to honor that and recognize that yeah I think this would feel less unfair if we had a lot of stray people who are accepting a call to vocational singleness yeah now I'm not suggesting that a majority of stray people should be vocationally single it's maybe even something like 10% of stray Christians who are call to vocational singleness but I still think I'd make a big difference if we if we had 10% of Christians straight Christians in every one of our churches who intentionally made a lifetime commitment to singleness for the sake of the kingdom and this wasn't just because there were the people who couldn't find spouses like this was the cream of the crop who felt like calling to vocational singleness you know I'm saying I'm yeah to be clear I'm not trying to say better than Christian marriage but I'm trying to say just as as emotionally physically mentally you know financially healthy people being called to vocational singleness has been called to Christian marriage and I think that concept of singleness although you know that that's perhaps a modern term but that that idea is in the Bible and present in the earliest church so it's not like it's like from a conservative if you're a conservative it's got good pedigree in terms of the reason why I'm Anglo Catholic and not are reformed in Anglican is actually the kind of Calvinist streams of Christianity have a history of ignoring what the Bible has to teach about singleness and teaching that of 99.9% of the people should be married that we should use marriage as a remedy for weakness and that it's not good to be single so that's why I'm drawn to Catholic sexual ethics they actually value what the scriptures have to say about singleness but that's a whole other thing so I ended up the just going to backtrack briefly it's interesting teaching to here and I heard other gay Christians with a more but I would call a more conservative theology on sexuality that's not your term that's mine but you describe the the other position as revisionist and this is this interesting reality to me in the church where and the secular world just has no idea about this that it's interesting you know Christian equals homophobic here please stay there so you've got churches and theologies interpretations of the Bible that say you're wrong and I'm wrong but probably more to the point you and that you're sort of needlessly repressing yourself for your stuck time ancient idea that was for dumb people 2000 years ago because they weren't as enlightened as us or that's probably a bit harsh that's not necessarily the way they they think through it but you know what I'm talking about every listener knows what I'm talking about and this is just one or not one in some ways this has become the major dividing point the listener's show they are would say between the conservative and what we call the more liberal or progressive theological end of the church whether it's Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic I've been interested in what how do you respond to this particular the fact that you're pursuing a particular vocation and you have a particular theology on this issue you've got a particular experience as a person and yet there's a whole not just from gay Christians but heterosexual Christians we think gay should get married and have sex yeah it's a put up yeah I mean I I certainly like wanted that to be true like believe me I have read every book not every book many of the books and and hoped that I would find a compelling argument for what people call revisionist sexual ethic or a progressive sexual ethic or what not and and for me I just I never found something that was was convincing enough I wanted it to be true that's probably wanted it to be true but I just I just couldn't get around to it and and and I'd say there's other reasons why you know I don't find a revisionist sexual ethic compelling but but you know to be to be fair I think one of the reasons why people particularly gay Christians often end up becoming convinced of a revisionist sexual ethic isn't necessarily because of the rigor of the intellectual arguments in my opinion but it's because of the power of the emotional arguments of how how unfair it feels you know even you know I think I have a lot of gay Christian friends who who kind of leave a historic sexual ethic where at least kind of historic sexual ethic practices and what they would say is maybe a historic sexual ethic is even maybe it's true maybe it is you know but the ways that the churches embody that has just led to such difficulty and and pain and loneliness and depression and suicidality in my life that I I wonder if some total me following what is not got to wisdom but in a way that seems to produce slightly less pain and destruction is better than following got to wisdom in a way that produces greater pain and destruction and they almost step into kind of seeking out same sexual romantic and sexual relationships saying you know these these might be sins but but some total my life will be less bad less painful less it'll include more joy more warmth and I just pray that God is merciful and I believe that God is much and I I guess I get that like that that that that's at least a kind of self-aware intellectually honest it is obviously way of going about it so yeah I you know yeah there's lots like lots of we could get into but I'll just pause there yeah yeah I guess I suppose what I'm partly interested in I don't know if you can speak to this of how the gay Christians in both camps I do do you have friends in that camp or these kind of quite separate camps because they're here at odds over the but the sexual ethic question yeah so I definitely have friendships with people that I that I believe differently on these topics and and I mean particularly can can empathize with gay Christians who hold a revision and sexual ethic like I understand what compels them in that direction I've experienced the same wounds of the claws that I've experienced the same kind of unfaithful unfaithful history of the church in terms of kind of embodying God's wisdom in ways that I can actually lead to thriving so like I get it I get what what is difficult about following a historic sexual ethic and what makes revision of sexual ethic appealing and and I have a number of friends who you know over the years have moved from a historic sexual ethic to a revision of sexual ethic and I've continued to to be their friends I think it also matters kind of what kinds of friends we were how close of friends we were before they moved to a revision of sexual ethic whether or not I felt like or whether they felt like we had kind of given each other permission to hold each other accountable or and or even like asked each other to hold each other accountable if we ever felt like we were we were strained from from God's wisdom and so I think particularly for people who had that kind of a relationship with we are still friends but the depth of the friendship changed because we realized oh we need to become kind of friends where we're not going to continually argue about sexual ethics but that also means in any friendship where big questions become all limits the friendship changes right so that's pretty normal the well I do want to have a chat about gender dysphoria because I'm very curious where this fits in but of course there's just so hard to do this that's all point of a long long one and even these two topics together seem to go together I mean they're part of a number of letters up together in their cell GBT IQ uh things so we can always circle back with the three seconds remaining while the time we do the gender dysphoria topic to same sex attraction yeah for sure I mean it is it is interesting because I think you find a thing quickly or ministry also and Pepsi was a counselor do work with gender dysphoria as well or for all with whether in the counseling or just the ministry with parents I guess it's probably often Christian parents now who would have young gut children or teens dealing with gender dysphoria I suppose that the thing I'm most interested in is that these two issues have been put together in the secular world not always happily because you've got your gender critical feminist some of them are lesbian so really object to the well at least a trans woman and it's a complex issue so in what ways is gender dysphoria similar and distinct because it seems to me that there have to be some distinctions because it's not really a sexuality we're dealing with and there's a whole vex question of the body and what is appropriate to do to it and that question of children here yeah so uh and I tend to use the the phrase I tend to refer to you know people as trans people or to use the phrase gender incongruence um at least here in the states the term gender dysphoria has historically been used to refer to a mental illness and so for some trans people they are okay with the phrase gender dysphoria and it's a phrase that's used even in kind of gender affirming care but for other people that phrase gender dysphoria for them really reminds them of kind of the the accusation that that they have a mental illness because they because they feel this disconnect between their biological sex and their felt gender and so yeah so for those reasons I tend to use trans or or gender incongruence so just just to explain to the audience why I use the words I use but yeah I think particularly for the Christian this conversation about gender insects and and same sex attraction and gender incongruence are very different because they get it there's to to understand each of those phenomena each of those realities and then to ask how is are they broken are they different than what got intended and then if so how has got asking this person to faithfully steward this reality rely on very different kind of theological questions right that the question of for same sex attraction is the question of did God intend same sex attractions but also what is God's design for Christian marriage what is the context for sexual activity that is God honoring what's the purpose of sexual activity um that's that whole set of questions right when it comes to gender incongruence it's a different set of questions of when God says in Genesis that he made the male and female what does he mean you know does and particularly because we in our world today we talk about biological sex and gender in in in in as as different concepts right and we I think any Christian who's engaging in this conversation needs to use the words that that the rest of the world is using to engage in the conversation cheritably right but also I think it's important for Christians to remember that one of the kind of early church heresies that the church pushed against was mind body dualism and was narcissism was this sense that that we can cleanly separate our mind body and spirit and that one of those is more truly us than the other and and early Christians holy rejected that idea and said no God has made a simultaneously mind body and spirit and we are destined for a physical new heavens and new earth where we will have a resurrected mind body and spirit and there's no way to cleanly separate those from each other the mind and the body and the spirit and and and and if you would have asked them they would have said and we doubt science will be ever to really cleanly separate those either so I think a Christian today should just always have a little hesitation towards anything that sounds like narcissism or or early church heresy okay but that goes both directions right because in this conversation you'll have more progressive people who would say that people's felt gender um tells them who they really are and everything else should be conformed to that reality okay you could say that's narcissism of a certain kind um or mind body dualism of a certain kind okay but then conservatives say that your biological sex tells you who you are fundamentally and then everything should be conformed to that that's mind body dualism of another kind that's narcissism of another kind um in a way so so I just I think I think yeah so let's all say they are very different right because we're asking questions about what was God's original intentions pre-fall about our biological sex and about our experience of is asking questions about our felt gender is different than our expressed gender and our expressed gender has to do with masculinity and femininity and that's theological questions about is there a universal biblical masculinity and femininity is there a way every Christian in every cultural context as opposed to express their maleness or femaleness um so yeah so that's one of the reasons why I think the church has been slow to have this conversation is because the cultural secular conversation is not asking these theological questions we can just switch these together as all being about honoring and celebrating diversity right and honoring people's felt experience but in a Christian space we don't have the theological we can't use the theological tools to that we've used to address same sex attraction compassionately and carefully we can't use the same tools to talk about trans people and and God's love and wisdom for trans people we need a whole different set of of tools and then because of that a lot of churches um I've been silent on it or even more silent than they are on on sexuality or if talk about it in even more problematic ways let me talk about people some do you think I mean we'll get on to how the church should be how those how those Christians and churches who adhere to that historic sexual I think that we've been discussing this whole show we'll get on to how well or badly they're dealing with this particular issue because I have been interested to know if they've made more if we've made more progress on the question of homosexuality than gender dysphoria noting that we've been late to the party on homosexuality and doing even half decent job there but I'm just interesting because at the heart of this conversation is a notion that we both agree on that you can be a gay Christian that's not a sin and we really know different at a fundamental level from a heterosexual Christian and in a month's like do you have a place in the church what's your if you want on a trans Christian? Right yeah yeah so yeah I think you're right that there is a way that the conversation particularly in the church about gender and congruences just way behind the conversation about same sex attraction that there's a way that like I would say around 2015 a a pretty built out kind of consensus of compassionate orthodoxy when it comes to same sex attraction I kind of risen to the top kind of a pretty solid middle way to talk about these things the same is not happened yet when it comes to God's love and wisdom for trans people I I think it's still that that that that that dialogue in the church and that kind of iterative attempts to discover what is that sweet spot in the middle has not been done yet and that's part of why we at a quick the ministry that I run have have kind of pushed ourselves to offer some resources in this topic even though we don't feel confident that we've we've done it perfectly because we think that's attempt making attempts and then having that attempt criticize feedback on that that and that iterative processes how we get at what's better okay but the question of can there be like a trans Christian in the same way that there can be a gay Christian I think absolutely so and and and particularly in the ways that I use the word trans so I mean if gender incongruence if I would define gender incongruence as a an acute sense of of incongruence between ones biological sex and ones felt gender and then if I use the word trans just to describe a person who experiences gender incongruence with no assumption about what steps of transition they have not they have or have not taken no assumptions about their theological convictions about trans topics but the word trans just means a person who experiences gender incongruence I think the research pretty clearly shows the people do not choose again there's a lot of parallels he'll here to how I just how we talked about same sex attractions people do not choose to experience gender incongruence there was no magical formula for making gender incongruence go away and so yeah I think a person can be a faithful Christian can can share their testimony of experiencing gender incongruence can condemn that by using the words our world uses which is to say I'm trans and I'm a Christian and then could say I believe that God is calling me to steward this by refraining from hormonal or surgical transition yet there's not some magical way to make my gender incongruence go away either and so I think God is inviting me to bring this this reality this painful reality this painful daily reality to the body of Christ and ask them to to to to honor that this is difficult to to give me space to share about it to come alongside me as I make sense of life and light of it and and perhaps kind of they will take some more some steps in the reigns of social transition that that aren't meant to communicate that kind of that ontologically they are something different than God intended but it's just meant to I am going to address in some more gender neutral ways I might even ask people to use gender neutral pronouns for me I may kind of go by nickname all of which are just meant to kind of reduce my number of daily reminders that I experience enduring gender incongruence but ultimately I recognize that who God ontologically made me first to be is who I am and and and and and and will be the reality of my resurrected body and I and I look forward to that yeah yeah if I can totally see the parallel there where in a way a certain type of transition is the equivalent of the same sex attracted Christian acting on there the sexual desires and so I totally get that I think where this gets difficult as if it's not difficult not for ready for the individuals and and for the church we haven't even broached the question of the political culture because I think that has a big big bearing to it makes this so complicated for Christians but see from my perspective I don't think even the most conservative Christians these days have any of those old prejudices at least about homosexuals at least not in in any serious numbers you know no one thinks it's a mental illness anymore for example at least I don't think I think that view would be most don't yes okay unfortunately some probably probably do I'm hoping it's a small number I think the difficulty and this is this is my view to is I feel like secular society does not and does not understand the transgender phenomenon very well and it's it's rushed down certain path which is gender's fluid and you have to affirm to prevent suicide and the earlier you go the better and basically you just follow the guidance of the child or teenager as it often is and they know what their gender really is and and I get the sense that the research really is way behind in terms of really understanding this and I don't think that's the case with homosexual I don't think there's much actually trying to stand about the desire because I would say it happens at a rate at high enough rates trans culturally and trans historically that you have to say it's a natural part of the fall-amold that we know if Christian points are going to be making a Christian the never generation in every culture going back thousands of years because that's just a common phenomenon in the world that we live in whereas it's much harder to unlock the transgender question and of course maybe that's because it was repressed but you have weird things as you know that familiar with like the explosion in the number of particularly young young girls and so they're they see knows that that say to me and I don't have a settled view on what's actually going on because it just seems this is partly why it's so interesting because it's just it's new and there's lots of complex factors and variables that seems but I suppose my one caution is like I totally understand the parallel and I think that's a well-made argument is just the part of me thinks you know in 50 years maybe that's too long but I think our understanding of the trans thing is going to evolve I think including in the secular society because I think already there's maybe back lashes at the right word but I think even even medical professionals are saying they think maybe we've kind of gone down a particular path of medicalization that you know the evidence is more mixed in terms of outcomes and so I don't know if you agree with that that kind of view whatever you would describe that view at or you're welcome to comment or respond to that perspective of offered yeah it's it's definitely I think you're right it among the people who identify as trans today there's a lot more diversity of what that really means for them and what their story has been than among the people who kind of identify as gay today and and as multiple reasons for that so one of those is for example yeah historically the percentage of people who have experienced who have identified as trans long-term or have experienced enduring gender incongruence has been less than 1% or maybe around 1.6% maybe 2% but it's less than the five to 10% that experience same sex attraction but but historically we've also known that that it's actually pretty common for three four five-year-olds to share about some level of gender incongruence and and we know this over decades of research that and this is not a this is not a a version of trans a prey the trans away that that is not one of about the share but there's just it's a recognized fact among researchers about these topics that 80% of the time 80% of kids who share about some kind of gender incongruence at three four or five it just resolves itself by the time they get to the end of period and a 20% of the time it persists throughout the person's lifetime okay but like but like four out of five kids who share when they're three four or five with their parents about some kind of gender incongruence if we just if we don't push the kids in either direction we just let them be kids we just love them well historically they're just their gender incongruence is kind of resolved itself as they've gone through puberty so so some of that maybe some of what we're experiencing is people not being patient and letting kids kind of get through puberty to see if this sticks and instead almost maybe pushing kids who might be that four out of five that it resolves on its own pushing them to settle into a trans identity in ways that might not may not fit for them right um then yes I think you've got something going on with a particularly an increase in teenage girls who did not share any share about any gender incongruence earlier in life but are highly connected on the internet have a lot of friends who have come out of strands and who are coming out as trans and maybe some people doubt how robust their gender incongruence is and maybe wonder if it's their identifying as trans as a way to make sense of broader teenage like angst and interterm oil and stress and this is a way to explain that and to come up with a simple solution to it maybe there's some of that happening um I think there's a lot of people also who are identifying as trans more broadly in identifying as gender non-conforming or gender or non-gender non-binary as just a way of rejecting rigid cultural expectations for men and women and if you ask them they would say they feel like they don't they don't feel like there's anything wrong with their biological sex they feel like their biological sex completely fits them what they're just rejecting is expectations that every boy and every girl has to dress in a certain way yeah so you've got all of that mixed together and called trans people and I think that's what's leading to an increased kind of um numbers yeah yeah you know the thing I find most but flexing about this whole cultural development I mean maybe it's just obviously more cultural but let's just call it cultural development because I guess there are certain ideas and assumptions about gender biological sex that pervade this issue because it and that and that position is held mainly by non-trans people non-trans heterosexual people who don't belong to the LGBT eye community that's have generated this kind of cultural change where we we think it's normal for men to have babies and you know we we use strange we're we're we're we're just at our language in that way the thing I find really curious is that it all actually what it does is it breaks down what could be an expansive and capacious conception of male and female so that female could be a spectrum of you know short hair more and close more mesk you know we and it must rent enter trans and non-binary and all these other things and then you actually reduce the the scope of male and female to something more stereotypical and so the young girl who doesn't feel girly thinks well I have I must be non-binary or maybe I'm a man right and so rather than saying no no you like I think I I wonder if there if there is a way to think about this completely differently and say to the young girl who says well I like sport I don't relate to all the girls doing their makeup you know in high school or the cheerleaders or whatever and you know why I prefer the company of boys or whatever whatever it is and I see any reason why that can't be one expression of female on us right unless you have a really narrow category of female on us which tells everyone if you're not a blonde head cheerleader who you know like taking selfies or whatever the stereotype of a young female girl at least these days then then you're not a female we're somehow allowing we've convinced ourselves that itself to really narrow and restrict it seems to me the categories of male and female and I think that's a real shame rather than the medical intervention or this kind of stuff wouldn't be better if we just had a more more capacious more diverse understanding of what it could mean to be a male and a female and then maybe there would be less incongruence between the way people felt in terms of their gender and their sex I'm not suggesting that's a simple fix to everything it's just it's more of a cultural comment that there's an irony here in the way the diversity he's actually waiting out the diversity of the old categories of male and female I guess this is what I'm saying yeah you're totally right I mean that's part of what makes the conversation confusing is there is actually two different kind of solutions that that secular spaces are offering that more progressive secular spaces are offering and one is that the gender binary exists and is good I was just born in the wrong body and another is that the problem is the gender binary and we need to blow that up and and it's not but those are actually opposing solutions to the problem yeah they're incongruent exactly yes and yeah and I think I think I think as Christians kind of both of those exist in a way as well I mean there are certainly people who are saying a gender binary exists and your biological sex is as God intended and that's what dictates who you are and and and then you know I think I would hold of you of saying that God was intentional about our biological sex and that is good and that some of the distress that people experience gender intergrunt are having is from a sense that that they're really their internal sense of their gender and their biological sex don't fit and there's certain care we ought to provide those people as they make sense of that but there's other people who really their rub is with yeah a cultural gender stereotypes and and I think actually I I think I could get on board with saying we need to reject cultural gender stereotypes we need to break those down some I mean when people ask me and this pops up some in the conversation about same sexual same sex attraction and gay people as well particularly for gay males there's there's kind of this question of am I in my two feminine and my masculine enough kind of that kind of stuff so so in verite of conversations I could ask like would you I think masculinity is or femininity is my definition for a long time has been masculinity is what a person with a penis does and femininity is what a person with a vagina does that's that's my definition like it's you know so if I paint my fingernails that's masculinity if I play football that's masculinity it's whatever I do is what masculinity is but you know maybe that's maybe that's too radical in terms of rejecting kind of cultural gender but I'm no that's yeah well speaking of the culture I think the place I'd like to finish is with the secular LGB TQ movement and asuring because there has been a sea change in the culture I made that reference to the 90s in Australia I don't know if it was similar in in America in the 90s where there was definitely no celebration of gay people and even non-Christian gayes were of non-Christian gayes I mean yeah non-Christian gayes you know public school you know government school in a very progressive part of Australia wouldn't have dead come out and I don't blame them because I think the it was just unknown so we all know the change if you're of a certain age if you've lived through it the gay flag I never saw I don't even remember seeing that growing up the very concept of LGB TQ is a community I don't I don't know when that I don't know who came up with it or when it came in but and in both our countries same six-page has become legal just in the last decade less than a decade you have corporations sporting having pride rounds and there's a lot of effort and celebration and I think everyone should be aware that there has been a history of not just poor treatment of gay people and trans people by the church but by governments and law and society more broadly but I'm really interested Peter here you are a gay Christian who feels a vocation to sing enough and you're living in this era where people in the secular world want to celebrate you and encourage you and I firm your home of sexuality but of course they would assume that there's that you should be out there enjoying yourself so to speak but I realize I'm generalising but just making the trick sure that we all so you know we've focused on the the church at this stage and I just be really fascinated to know how do you respond to this idea of secular society saying you're a member of the LGB TQ community uh do you have a tell of non-Christians your story how how north do they respond and do you feel like this the general culture is a help for a hindrance to you as a gay Christian man or a mixture of the two yeah it's definitely a mixed bag I mean I don't want to sound like an alarmist but you know when I it seems like sometimes I have to come out to people as a Christian and as a celibate and to people who are not Christians yeah and um and I'm out of another closet yeah and and and they don't welcome me as a gay celibate Christian so I'm wrong yeah I mean of really specific examples that last year myself and and a quip and some other gay celibate Christians wanted to have a booth at one of the pride festivals in our inner in our nearby city and we were very clear that we're not going to be pushing any kind of pray the gay way things we're not even going to be pushing a traditional sexual ethic we just wanted to be there and tell people that God loves gay people and hand out water bottles and just hang out right man but be apart but participate in this in this celebration of gay people as gay people and we were we were totally couldn't come really because we because we taught about the possibility of celibacy and and so so yeah it's an expect you know I'm I'm really grateful that the kind of quick advance of the other LGBT plus movement has meant that you know we've done away with thinking of same sex attractions as a mental illness right that we recognize that people don't choose who they're attracted to there's no one's fault that they're gay I'm really glad that it's brought this experience into the light it's given people courage to talk about it it's it's decreased shame and homophobia it's exposed the lies of the pray the gay way of movement all of those things are great like great for gay people of all kinds great for the work of loving gay people in the church those are good things that's a really good things yeah and at the same time it's it's kind of normalized and made seem and made more acceptable you know sexual behavior that I think is contrary to God's best and to be clear like I think straight people did that for decades and decades before gay people did that and so that's not a new thing but but yet it's it's happened I think particularly in American context it's led to people seeing their sexual identity and their gender identity as a more like totalizing aspect of their personhood than I think is really healthy and and I think we kind of it's also led to kind of hiding the the frequent results of moving from a historic sexual ethic to a revisionist sexual ethic but I think if I kind of put all those things together and I average it out I think it's unenibly clear that things are better off for gay Christians who want to follow God's wisdom today than they were 50 years ago and so certainly things that I wish would be different about the ways the the LGBT plus kind of political movement talks about and programs around these things but but on the whole I'm I'm grateful yeah and would you do you think if yourself as a member of the LGBT or a cute community or is that do you think of that as a sort of something outside of the Christian experience or is it like compatible fear in some way? I definitely did like two years ago and if I would hesitate today it's not because I think it's not because I'm afraid the conservatives would tell me that I can't be gay and Christian it's not that hesitation it's not a hesitation that I think the label LGBTQ plus and and Christian can't go together that's not my hesitation my hesitation increasingly is is I don't know if is that particularly based on my experience last summer with us not being allowed to be a part of this pride celebration the message I got from that experience and the message I'm increasingly getting is that being a part of the LGBT plus community has less and less to do with you get your ticket in because you have some undeniable, unchosen, psychological experience of same sex attraction or gender and congruence and and you get your ticket in because you experience the wounds of the closet and and because of those two things you belong in this community that's no longer the ticket in to that community it feels like the ticket in is regardless of your actual sexual orientation or gender orientation if you are on board with the cultural and political agenda of the LGBTQ plus movement then you belong here and if you're not on board with the political and cultural agenda even if you're gay even if you suffered the wounds of the closet you aren't a part of us that's the message I'm hearing so it's not that I I want to be a part of that movement but I feel like maybe I'm hearing that movement say that they don't claim me and they don't want me to say I'm a part of that I don't know if that's the case you know we'll see where we are in a year two or three from now but but yeah and pay to if people want to find out more about a quick way did they go yeah I've got a website where there's lots of content about all the conversations we talked about today free content and that's Peter L Volk dot com P-I-E-T-E-R-L-V-A-L-K dot com and then if you anybody's on social media and wants to connect there my handle on most platforms is P-I-E-T-E-R-L-V-A-L-K so yeah we'd love to stay connected to people and then from those websites you can learn more about a through my website in particular you can learn more about equipped the the ministry that I help run you can learn about the intentional Christian community that I live in you can learn about my dog and my godson and the fact that I play the bassoon and other you know more fun things so yeah we didn't even get to diving to the intentional community that sounds interesting but I think we're probably gone as far with this in this patience as we can only Joe Rogan can get away with three and a half hours and I'm not Joe Rogan at the moment so but Peter really enjoyed conversation my run-a-ste I've got a powerful message for for Christians and I learned a lot and I found it really interesting and I'm sure listening is due to so thank you so much for having it with me.
