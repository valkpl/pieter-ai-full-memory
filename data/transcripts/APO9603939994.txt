 What do you get when you take somebody who identifies as gay, but also identifies as Christian? And not only that, but identifies with the historic Christian sexual ethic, which says that God's design for sexuality and marriage was always intended to be between one man and one woman. That's what we will explore in today's episode as we have a wonderful conversation about compassionate sexual orthodoxy with Peter Valkin. Guys, I have to tell you, I was so blessed and impressed chatting with Peter. He balances the concepts of truth and love around this issue. So well, he is absolutely committed to what the scripture teaches about sexuality. And yet, he's also can passionately open about the struggle of what it's like to live as a same sex-attracted person. And not only that, I think he speaks prophetically to the church in such a gentle, intelligent, balanced way about the need for us to course correct some of the flaws of the past and look towards a future where people who struggle with same sex attraction and even struggles beyond that can find healing, redemption and forgiveness and unconditional love in the arms of Jesus and community in the arms of the church. This is going to be part one of a two-part series of episodes. Peter is going to do a great job setting up who he is, what he believes, what his experience has been and what his heart is for the church. And he's going to answer some deep questions about some of the theological concerns and implications that could be raised around his viewpoint. And so that's going to be part one. And then in part two, we're going to come back for another episode responding to pushback that Peter has gotten from people who are confused about who he is and what his ministry is. And I've just got to say in advance, you're not going to want to miss part two. Peter handles it like a champ with so much grace and love and wisdom. I'm excited you guys are here. Thanks for listening and with that, let's get into part one of our conversation with Peter Valk. Hey everybody, welcome to the Good Line podcast. I am your host, Ernest Alvado and I'm here with my new friend, Peter Valk. Hello. Good to be here. It's good to have you, man. It's so good. I'm so excited about this episode. A little nervous, mostly excited. I think this is going to be good for those of you as you don't know, Peter. He is the founder and leader of a ministry called Equip. And he is one of the founders of the Nashville family of brothers, two things that are super interesting that I'm sure he'll be able to tell you more about. But overall, Peter's life and ministry is dedicated towards helping Christians navigate the crazy, choppy, difficult waters of sexuality, same sex attraction, all of that stuff. It's a part of his life story and it's a part of what he's called to. And I'm very excited to have him share about those aspects today with us. Peter, welcome to the show. Yeah, I think for the opportunity to chat about these topics, I forget that I talk about controversial topics and this controversial topic for a living and so I'm really comfortable with it. But I know that's not the case for podcasts, so it's not the case for a lot of Christian leaders and a lot of parents. So I'm really grateful for the opportunity to hopefully help some leaders and parents out with navigating these topics with God's love and with God's wisdom. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that's the thing, man. I mean, this show is actually, I mean, our tagline is, you know, no easy answers. It's good line. It's based on C.S. Lewis, the idea of God is he is good, but he's not safe. And so we're we're always trying to dive into those complex controversial topics in a Christ-centered way, but even though we've been doing this for years, it still stresses me out to a point because I find that a lot of podcast space is so flippant and it's so opinion driven. And for me, it's like, I don't want people to get necessarily my opinion. I want to point them to truth, you know? So so that's that's where the cautiousness comes in. I think I found out about you through Brenna Blaine, who was on our episode or it might have been Jeremy Jankens who interviewed you as well. He's a part of our podcast network, but you've been on my radar and then you actually reached out. And we're like, hey, man, let's collaborate. And I was so blessed that you did that. Thank you. You're welcome. Yeah, both both the brinna and the Jeremy image and great people doing good work. Yes, absolutely. Peter, I think before we get into the meat of the episode, it'd be great for people to just hear a little bit about you and who are you? Why do you do? What can you break down that for us? Yeah, so I am a writer and speaker about discernment, vocational, singleness, LGBT plus topics according to historic sexual ethics. And I've been published in places like Christianity today and and mere orthodoxy and and have spoken it over 85 churches and Christian universities and campus ministries. As you mentioned, I'm the founder and executive director of Equip, which is the premier consulting and training solution for churches, aspiring to be places where LGBT plus people thrive according to historic sexual ethics and we trained over 21,000 Christian leaders. I'm a teacher and aspiring deacon in the Anglican church in North America about celibacy and sexuality. I am one of the founding brothers of the National Family of Brothers, which is an equiminically Christian monastery building lifelong family in Nashville for men called to vocational singleness. And then I'm a licensed professional counselor and I specialize in serving gay Christians hoping to steward their sexuality according to historic sexual ethics. And yeah, a lot of my jobs have to do with sexuality and finding belonging in the body of Christ and this work, all this work matters to me because I am a Christian and I am gay. I have persisting same sex attractions and I am committed to a historic sexual ethic. And when I say historic sexual ethic, here's what I mean. I mean a belief that God's best for every Christian is either what's called vocational singleness, which is a lifetime vocation of abstinence singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention or Christian marriage, which Christians have historically understood to be a lifetime vocation of opposite sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom. So I believe that God's best for every Christian is either vocational singleness or Christian marriage, including myself. And it's been a journey for me. I grew up in a Christian home. I knew I was a sinner who needed a savior and then in middle school when I realized that I was same sex attraction, when I realized it was gay. I knew what the Scriptures taught about that. I knew what how my parents and my church understood the Scriptures to teach about that. You know, for a while, I thought I had done something wrong. And that was why I was same sex attraction for a lot longer. I thought that well, maybe if I pray hard enough, or I go to the right therapists, or I, or I make deals with God, I can force him to change my sexual orientation. And after 10 years and thousands of prayers and hundreds of hours of therapy and nine months out of prayer the gay away ministry, nothing changed about my sexual orientation. But I continue to be convinced that of a historic sexual ethic that that that that that a God exists and that that God knows what's best for me better than I do and the way we know how that God thinks about anything is we read the Scriptures with the historic church and to me the the arguments for the arguments that a historic sexual ethic is how God thinks about this are are are are are a pretty pretty strong pretty convincing for me. But figuring out then what to do with that, you know, okay, how do I follow that in a way that's faithful and a way that brings fullness of life to me has been a whole other challenge and that that's involved, you know, starting to share my story with brothers and sisters in Christ that I'm doing life with discovering that I was not alone in being a Christian and being gay and trying to follow a God's teachings, but realizing that that there's a lot of of gay Christians committed to a true, a historic sexual ethic out there and and all of us are pretty similar experiences that that we were afraid would be alone if we followed God's wisdom and we didn't have parents or pastors who knew how to help us. And so in many ways those two things were were kind of the beginnings of of two of the big products I'm involved in right now. First was in 2014 I started a quip that ministry whose mission is to equip parents and pastors to better minister to people like me according to God's wisdom and then in 2018 I helped start the National Family of Brothers which is a place where people like me and by people like me in this context I mean not necessarily same sex attracted but any men who feel called to celibacy for Jesus can find family in the National Family of Brothers. So and there's been lots of of bumps and and turns and pit stops along the way but that's that's my story in a in a nutshell. Wow it's beautiful Peter. I'm just honestly so encouraged man by people like you Christians who live a life of radical self sacrifice. I mean it could ultimately every Christians called to a life of self sacrifice but I can recognize there there is a sacrifice you're making that you know for me is a straight man. I don't face that same struggle. I have options that I can you know choose within the you know umbrella of God's will and so I just man I respect the heck out of guys like you and what you're doing and just when I look at somebody who's like I am committed to the way of Jesus and I care enough about the the reality of sin and the reality of that sin hurts people and it destroys lives that I'm not going to do what's easy but I'm going to do what Christ requires of me. That's that's beautiful man and it's inspirational and so you know I I look up to you in that way and I'm encouraged to hear your story. I've been encouraged to you know read some of your story and listen if you podcast episodes I might actually link in the show notes a few other podcast episodes that Peter was on that go into even greater detail about his testimony because I think it's really worth listening to but yeah Peter thank you so much for sharing that and for being who you are man I think it's an important thing to have guys like you on this show because this show represents within a church movement called Calvary a Calvary Global Network CGN we've got a lot of people listening within CGN and even some without that are young adult Christians trying to navigate the craziness of this postmodern post Christian world we've got young pastors, youth pastors, young adults pastors even some senior pastors who listen because they're they're wanting to understand these things at a deeper level and I want to understand these things at a deeper level. So that's I'm not hosting this episode as an expert I'm kind of looking to you as an expert and so I just want to dive deep into some of the stuff with you if that's okay. Yeah for sure for sure and I appreciate the encouragement but I and I think something that might even be helpful for your listeners is maybe for me to push back on the assumption that same sex extractor, same sex-attracted Christians are are so opposed to have it have a more difficult life then then you know opposite sex-attracted Christians. Yeah it may be true that experientially because of the unfaithfulness of the church it is harder for me currently but I don't think that's what got intended because I think if if if our takeaway is it is truly more unfair for gay people than straight people yet God chooses most of the time not to change people's sexual orientations. We can talk some double-speak around that but at the end of the day it's hard not to conclude that that God would just be cruel but I don't think that's how that don't think that's true so you know I think there's some ways that that I bear some extra wounds and some extra burns particularly because of the years I spent into closet hiding this part of my story that that maybe wear me down a little bit but but I don't think it has to be that way I think we could be at church where as soon as kids notice the same sex attractions or gender incongruence are a part of their story they share with parents and they share with pastors and that those people in their lives help them make sense of that and they never they never accrue the the anxiety and the depression and the unhealthy coping mechanisms and the barriers to healthy intimacy that I kind of collected over years so I think that's avoidable you know so I think it doesn't have to be hard and hurt or in that way I think as well you know at least say for my story while I'm not by sexual I'm not generally attracted to women as much as I am attracted to men I'm not genuinely physically or romantically attracted to women at all that I wasn't some dating relationships in college where I was transparent with the women that that I was going on dates with really I was in a Christian fraternity that required me to take women on date events and then kind of accidentally thought so accidentally ended up getting into dating relationships with these women because I thought they were cool and I was like hey you know my story but what if we just went on some more dates and kept on hanging out and and I and I fell in love with a couple of them and grew some specific desires for a couple of them so I actually know that the Christian marriage could work for me yes and and I'm following but I brought that question to God God you calling me to Christian marriage or you calling me to singleness for the Lord that I see in Matthew 19 or 1st Corinthians 7 and I felt clearly that the God was calling me to to shut the door on Christian marriage and to follow the in the footsteps of the kind of singleness that Jesus and Paul talk about in scriptures so this is I don't feel forced into celibacy I think it's many ways the same options were before me as is before any straight Christian and I joyfully accepted Jesus says call and I don't think a call to celibacy or to vocational singleness it's supposed to be any harder than a call to faithful Christian marriage yeah I don't think any of us need sexual romance to be whole people and we know that there won't be sexual romance and in the next life and so they are temporary pleasures what I see is that neither faithful monogamy nor faithful celibacy come naturally to the broken Christian hmm yeah both of them are unnatural to us in our broken state both of them require a huge grace from Jesus to do either well and and and I'll say at least you know I'm doing life with some some married Christians and in my church who are raising a bunch of kids and I don't know if my life is harder than theirs it's different it's a different pattern the the grass is not greener on the other side the average color of my grass is the same color as the average color of their grass just the pattern of the grass is a little different on my side versus their side but so so I'll say top line if there's anything that's harder about my life or about my peers who are gay and Christian and feel called to vocational singleness called the celibacy I think it's because our church has doesn't know what to do with people called the vocational singleness yeah not that it has to be inherently harder and so anyway that's that's all to say it's a long-winded answer but I think God's hopes for the church is that if we would be faithful around how we teach and disciple about LGBT plus topics and how we teach and disciple about vocational singleness regardless of sexual orientation I think our church is could be places where LGBT plus people were thriving according to God's wisdom just as much and just as easily as anyone else that's good man I mean that that's really encouraging that's good pushback for me like sure here because you know I have leaned into that aspect of things being harder I mean I remember one time I was speaking to a group of my my boys my my straight male high school boys you know and they they were it was at a youth group event and they were making fun of gay people they were singing some song around the fire about how it's Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve and just kind of generic high school mockery and I just pulled a side and I just felt led to try to speak to them in that moment and I was like guys I just want you to try to understand a little bit of what somebody on the other side goes through like imagine me as your youth pastor if I were to say hey guys I've been studying the scriptures and the scholars and the other pastors and I've come to this conclusion that your attraction to women is unnatural and for you to ever act on it or have sex or want to get married or have kids it's actually impossible for you and you can't do that how would you feel and they kind of like the lightbulb went on their head they're like whoa and one one boy said very you know a very deep real raw thing he was like if that was the case I would probably have a hard time following Jesus and being a Christian and I would be really tempted to just not be a Christian I think that was a wake up call for them just to recognize that there is this layer of difficulty that's different from what they experience but I do like what you said pushing us back to the reality of like it doesn't have to be as hard as it is because a lot of that hardness comes from the way the church over the years has mishandled this and if we can forge a better future for how to create an environment where people who struggle with this can feel welcomed not affirmed in any sin but affirmed and hey you you are a person who's loved and valued and you are sexually broken just like I am a straight person I'm sexually broken and can we follow Jesus together and can we can we encourage one another you know and so I love your heart band and what you're saying it's really beautiful yeah I think what gives and even for that that high school student who responded really honestly I think what empowers that response is a belief that that romance and sex are the most meaningful ways for humans to connect and so if anyone was deprived of the opportunity to enjoy that with the people that they're most drawn to or enjoy that with anyone that they are being deprived of of an essential and best human experience and and I think what I'd push by obviously sex and romance are beautiful yes from God particularly when used in the right context and when and when when when a line with his desires and his purposes and I don't think the idea that that is the most beautiful or meaningful connection is found in scripture I think that some a lie sold by Disney Channel and by Taylor Swift songs and by the back floor in the Bachelor Reps. I think we read the scriptures we we see that that that that that friendship non-Romantic non-sexual friendship is is at the core of what it means for Jesus to relate to his fellow humans when he was on earth and we see and we hear a lot from from David about how much friendship meant to him and he was a man after God's own heart and how much he in some ways not that he valued his friends more than his spouse but that he saw that love as something that that that that that that rivaled not in a competitive way but in a way that was just as beautiful but different but just as beautiful so so if I don't assume that sex and romance are the best ways or the only ways to enjoy healthy connection with people then a way we could reframe this is that I think gay Christians committed to God's wisdom are just as much invited by Jesus to love in non-sexual non-Romantic but meaningfully intimate ways the people they admire the Jesus has invited me to love men in ways that honor God's wisdom but are not lesser yeah but actually just as as meaningful just as good I mean they are they are the best ways that I can enjoy friendship with with with men that I admire for any number of reasons so I don't feel like Jesus is telling me you're drawn to these people in your life but you have to run away from them I think he's telling me you're drawn to these people in your life and and maybe there's some some aspects of those desires that aren't what I meant for you but you can have meaningful relationship meaningful friendship with those people and hey I want to give you some advice of some healthiest best ways to do that so that you can enjoy friendship with them for a lifetime in the most life giving ways it's beautiful man yeah I mean I I myself I know have been guilty of elevating marriage to this ultimate place because I was a kid who grew up and had a hard time making friends and then when I met my wife she became my best friend and so for a while I did elevate marriage into a a place that might not have been biblical in the sense of I devalued the the actual you know fraternal friendships with other people you know I I think that there is such a need for that there's always been a need for that but I think there's a a resurgence in the church of recognizing like hey single people are not junior Christians in training waiting for the magical day when they get married and can truly be a part of the kingdom of God it's like no they're they are just as much a part of the kingdom and actually Paul goes on to say that they are going to be more effective because they're not held back by the cares of this world they're they're going to be more unrestrained to do kingdom work I think the the next place I'd want to go from here is I want to dive into some theology stuff with you around the church some some of your personal theology around this stuff right now there's a big conversation that's happening kind of in the Christian commentary theology world you know Twitter spaces podcasts I've been just paying attention to it because it's part of my job to pay attention to it and everyone right now seems to be debating the question of is same sex attraction sinful the way that I've always framed it in my mind is to experience a temptation does not mean that you yourself are actually sinning to act on the temptation in any way is where the sin comes into play but have you been paying attention to that conversation do you have any thoughts on that conversation yeah so and usually where people diverge or where people come to different conclusions on that question is both they're use of the word sinful and then whether or not they have a kind of a a Calvinist theology of concubusence so yes we're getting a bit into the weeds here but I'll start with the simpler the two and that's the word the use of the word sinful so there's two ways to define the word sinful sometimes we use it to describe something that is related to something that is broken but we're not saying that the thing is actual sin right so if I'm using this in the context of same sex attraction I would say same sex attractions are sinful meaning same sex attractions are related to a brokenness but experiencing same sex attractions are not themselves actual sin until you say yes to them in thought word or deed okay but another way people use the word sinful is to say that merely experiencing that thing is a sin so they may say same sex attractions are sinful meaning merely experiencing same sex attractions are actual sin so some of this is the trickiness of our use of the word sinful and maybe slapping us of our use of the word sinful which is one of the reasons why I just don't use the word sinful I will say whether it is a sin or it is not a sin and I think it's a little bit more precise language so that's personal preference I kind of just try to avoid the word sinful and the same way I think the word desire is kind of confusing I avoid the word desire I just use the word temptation versus lust because I think those are a little bit more obvious what they mean okay so then there's the question of well then are merely experiencing same sex attractions a sin if we're asking that question more precisely and yeah I think historically the church would say that the being tempted is not an actual sin and I think of the that meaningful consensus of global Christians today and the denominations that they are part of believe that merely being tempted is not actual sin but there are some theological traditions that don't see as much of a distinction between being tempted and kind of being vulnerable to temptation because of our brokenness versus the moment a couple of moments later where we where we choose to participate in that temptation and have had their foresend and they would see the line between those two things a lot more blurry or even they're not being aligned there but instead of gradient and not seeing kind of the the clear distinction of kind of our agency being that meaningful and so they would say there's not really a difference between being tempted and between acting on a temptation merely being broken merely experiencing same sex attraction is a sin so that's not what I personally believe but but equipped the organization I work for we have worked with churches who that is there that they're perspective and and I think our archie kind of recommendation to those to spaces that believe in kind of a Calvinist view of concupicins that's what would lead to that perspective on the merely being tempted with something is a sin that's a new word for me Oh, compupicins yeah yeah we're really given the weeds there is is that a primary position that like most reform people would hold you think or is it sort of a niche thing historically it is the also the word reformed is tricky because reform could also refer to Lutheran it could refer to Anglican according to for two of the reformation so I'm thinking more in the sense of Calvinism which I'm I'm not a Calvinist but I have many friends that are and I love them and serve with them even though there's some differences there yeah yeah I think it's it's it's pretty his standard kind of historic Calvinist theology so but but I think there's a way to apply that consistently to everyone in your church and everyone's temptation in your church that that that that that would avoid how targeting of of people who experience same sex attraction so mm yeah I mean I don't know if this is overtly simplistic but in my mind I do go to the verses that's talk about Jesus being tempted in every way and but without sin and there there does seem to be some biblical distinction the temptations themselves are sinful in the sense of their product of the fall there are product of a sinful broken world but it doesn't necessarily translate to you are therefore in sin if you experience these things and I think that's freeing for a lot of young people to hear whether they're straight or gay because a lot of like young people as as a youth pastor I know a lot of young people when they're going through the process of purity they're hit with all of these sexual temptations and I think it can be very freeing for them to understand like hey it's not about experiencing them it's what do you do with them and how do you set up safeguards to help yourself deal with them in the future you I want to jump into something that you said that I I was really impressed with it is it cool if I quote you sure this is this is a post that you wrote on social media recently you said I recently went on the things you don't hear in church podcast to talk about faith and sexuality one of the questions that was explored was whether God intends for people to experience same sex attraction even queer secular scientists recognize that no one is born gay we all develop our sexual orientation from a mix of genetics and relational upbringing but even if we were born gay that doesn't tell us about God's intentions and then you went on to say none of us are how God intended all of us were corrupted at a genetic level formed imperfectly on our mothers womb born into a fallen world that injured us countless times before we developed true agency and then I was skipping ahead but you said this here as I've explored at length in equips responding to convincing arguments for revisionist sexual ethics Romans one teaches us that same sexual desires are unnatural broken and contrary to God's first intentions okay I'll put the link to the rest of the post in the show notes for you guys who want to read it but I just want to stop there Peter that's that's a heavy thing to teach and it's it's something I agree with but I just want to recognize it's heavy and I think that I think that sometimes I've seen people hold this truth in an in balanced way where when it comes to homosexuality they only focus on the unnatural aspect and so it's just focused on it's not natural it's not natural and like I'd argue that even though it's true that heterosexual relationships are God's original design yes I would say for straight married men lust towards a woman who's not your wife is also unnatural because that's against God's design for you of a one-man woman relationship I don't know if you agree with that assessment but I think when we're talking about nature we can focus so much on just you know is somebody straight or are they not straight and I think looking more holistically at it looks at what is God's entire intention like it is not God's intention for me to lust after women that are not my wife that's unnatural according to God's designs so my follow-up question to this for you would be like I'm sure it's distressing for gay Christians or for a gay person who's maybe new to Christianity or like dabbling into it like dipping their feet into the waters of it it might be distressing for them to hear that something that they see their sexual orientation as one of their core identities is unnatural that's a hard thing to hear about yourself how do you help balance the truth and the love aspects of communicating the theological position here yeah so if it when it feels like we only make this claim in church about seems sexual orientation then then it then it feels unfair or it feels like targeting or it feels harsh but if our churches were teaching yeah that everyone's sexuality is broken and there's plenty that is broken about the desires for for people of the opposite sex you know and so yeah certainly people who are married are capable of lusting after people who they're not married to I would also say I think people who are married are capable of lusting after their spouse what does that look like break break that down so I mean I one way to understand lust is whenever we objectify someone to consume or use them in selfish ways yeah and you know there there's I mean that's obvious if it's in the context if there's some kind of like physical or emotional or sexual abuse happening between spouses but I think there's even ways that that I at least my married friends have talked about ways that they know sometimes when they are not doing well they look at their wife in the same way that they would look at a woman in pornography they want to use them to feel better yeah wow that's just a simple I just talked to a guy recently that opened up about that so that's a real thing yeah and there can be mild reforms of that you know but it's also tons of broken things about us that aren't sexual right I mean for me when I when people ask you know people maybe we'll make a comparison between same sex attractions and alcoholism and I'll push back and I'll say I don't think that's a helpful analogy for a variety of reasons and they'll say well what is a helpful analogy and I say well I think it's best compared to genetic psoriasis or being born blind or being born death it's a physical brokenness it is not that we were supposed to be that God rarely heals that makes our life more difficult and tempts us to sue ourselves based on our own designs and based on our own wisdom and disobey God and yet God has wisdom for us for best ways to steward that enduring brokenness and he promise us that our redeemed bodies will be perfect and what these brokennesses will not persist yeah that's it it's it's interesting to hear you use that kind of terminology because I I see the truth in it I feel like when I hear that terminology employed the people I normally hear saying it are like the most kind of crusty conservative political commentator and it's it's coming in a very like aggressive way and I hear you saying it in a gentle way but I'm sure for some people it still stinks because I mean what kind of might the first place that my brain went to when you said what you said is is almost like are we taking this as far as like the terminology of mental illness you know if like this is something that is not normal and we're we're owning that you know are what you take it that far and and and how do you when you disciple because a big part of what you do and your audience I've seen on social media is people that are wrestling through this not just church leaders who want to know how to do better but people that are struggling with their same sex attraction so when when when you say something like that and somebody's like hey that's really hurtful like that that makes me feel devalued as a person like how do you respond and I'm asking that question really intentionally because there's a lot of pastors and leaders listening who want to be able to speak truth about this stuff but they also many of them they they really do care about like how do I do this sensitivity so that people don't write off me and my church and Jesus and leave wounded you know yeah because there's been so much harsh rhetoric in the past that didn't have any of the love behind the truth you know so how would you go there yeah so I mean definitely definitely want to clarify don't think it's a mental illness in that way I don't think it would be helpful to for you know the psychological community to define it as a mental illness I don't think there are treatments to make a person less gay I wonder what's at the core of this is so even people who are not believers like we know the world is not the way it's supposed to they know the world is not the way it's supposed to be very true they know that people are not supposed to be blind they know that people are not supposed to be deaf and and maybe we'll focus on those too because that it doesn't have some of the baggage of some other things do now there are increasingly movements to try to kind of advocate for this idea that actually just being blind being deaf is just a natural variation in in biology in nature and they're not mutations they're not mistakes they are they are equally as kind of you know biologically it fit as being able to see and being able to hear I think we're attempting to do there is is is some people in our world just wanting to really resist accepting that the world is off because then that requires us to come up with explanation for for there to be away things ought to be and that something is off that would mean that there's some standard there's some source of of of of reality there's some ultimate truth there's some reason that we can claim things are not right and they should be made right there should be justice right and that requires a god philosophically right so we're trying to avoid like kind of the things that set you up for philosophically needing a god but I think we kind of know that's just double speed you know and in many ways I think ultimately cruel to people who are deaf and blind yeah who they have maybe I found some ways to find some community and belonging among those who have a similar who are similarly deaf or blind and because they have similar shared experiences there's some special kind of community and belonging they find in those spaces but at the end of the day and they wouldn't trade away those relationships they've made for it you know but but they don't wish that they were blind or deaf and and so I don't know I think of our churches became places where we talked more about the reality of all of us being broken the none of us are the way the god meant for us to be and that for on then all of us have at least one if not multiple things that will continue to be broken until we die and God even if we ask we'll choose not to heal them and then we have a theology of explaining then why how could a good God choose not to heal those things and still be good and kind of answer those problem in your questions we were doing all that well one it would benefit everybody in the church because we all are kind of a dissatisfied with some of the answers that we maybe overly simplistic answers we've gotten on those questions in church but then those churches will become places where it wouldn't seem as weird or cruel or strange for us to to say oh and experiencing sexual traction also one of those things that's a really good point because when the focus is just on one particular sin and emphasizing it and this this is I don't know if this has been your experience but I think it might be from what I've heard of your story but when I talk to a lot of people my age who either are like peers of mine friends who came out of the closet and ended up being gay and leaving the church and I keep in touch with some of these friends and what I hear them saying over and over again and this is you know multiple friends is when I was in the church it never felt like when the church talked about gay people that they were talking to me it felt like they were talking to a congregation they assumed we're all straight and when they talked about gay people it was those people out there those sinners out there and look at what they're doing and look at how they're bringing down society and all that stuff so for gay people sitting in those congregations closet it there was never any hope presented of you know when when they talk about straight peoples pornography or adultery or divorce or any of this stuff it was always presented as like hey but there's hope there's redemption because the assumption was there's people in the room that are struggling with that but because the assumption was there's not anybody in this room that could possibly be struggling with that we're just going to talk against the culture and not recognize there are people struggling right here that need the gospel and need a message about how they yes they're broken but they can be redeemed yeah yeah and I think that's based on an assumption for a number of decades that if people were gay it's because they chose to be gay and so well obviously no one would be in this congregation and be gay because they if they were in this congregation genuinely then they would choose not to be gay and they would no longer be gay and so therefore the only gay people are people outside of this room that's not a historic teaching of the church that is a a strange kind of theological conclusion that started popping up in the 70s and 80s and got popularized in reaction to the AIDS crisis but that is not that's not how that that's not how even Billy Graham and Frances Schaefer and like and prominent theologians in the middle 20th century thought about homosexuality and same sex attractions so it's a strange kind of theological idea of the pray the gay away movement and of the ex gay movement that people choose their sexual orientation thankfully most most churches most kind of credible denominations are moving on from that those those assumptions and recognizing that people neither choose their sexual orientations nor are people born genetically determines to develop a particular sexual orientation where neither born gay nor choose to be gay but yeah I think that was maybe the source of that for for a and that was maybe true that was true the churches that I grew up in and true of the churches that my peers grew up in was they kind of assumed that people chose to be gay so if you're in this room it's you've chosen not to be gay music Peter I think anybody who's listening this far is probably really blessed with what you're saying really encouraged by what you're saying when you try to do what you do with a quip do you feel like a lot of times you feel like there's walls up that you have to break down with people where maybe they assume certain things about your ministry at first glance you know they they might assume like oh you know because there is the word gay just simply the word gay in this sentence that they're they're assuming that you take a progressive Christian stance or a theologically liberal stance do you find that you have to deal with those barriers yeah and I think I get it kind of from from both directions and some of it is I guess is reasonable right like I would not be reasonable for me to assume or for me to demand that every person who stumbles upon anything that I've written or anything about me on the internet within spend 30 minutes reading an explainer article on my website that clarifies each of the tricky things that they might misunderstand right right that would not be reasonable for me to demand and so people are going to take a quick glance and based on all of their previous life experiences and what these words and what these things have meant that people have used in the past are going to make a quick judgment a quick assessment of who I might be and that's just kind of how humans work like it's it's efficient even if it times inaccurate so yeah I get a lot of that from both directions and I think that's why part of my job is to be patient with that and to take the time to clarify and I think that's because I represent this kind of middle way between two extremes of of the revisionists kind of sexual ethics on one extreme and the x-gay theology on the other extreme and I don't know if this what I would call compassionate orthodoxy in the middle has been built out enough to where the average Christian knows what the what the platform is you know what the talking points are for someone who finds themselves in that middle space they know what the talking points are for revisionist sexual ethic they know what the talking points are for x-gay theology but the stuff in the middle it's it's it's not as built out it's not as crystallized it's not as kind of uniform and and and well market it you know and so yeah yeah people don't know what they're getting into when they when they interact with me and so I'm I'm but I'm willing and you're to to clarify well I'm glad that you have thick skin I can tell that you you've developed that and and I love what you're saying about that that humble orthodoxy in the middle I think that's beautiful and that's a huge value that we at this show try to carry is you know that that humble orthodoxy yeah thank you that concludes part one of our conversation with Peter Valk and as we wind down from the episode let's do a little recap what a blessing to hear from Peter I mean what an incredible guy I love his heart I love his story I love his faithfulness to Jesus and to theological orthodoxy and to being willing to walk a really hard road of obedience and yet to do it in a way that is encouraging and beneficial and a blessing to others that are struggling with the same things that he's struggling with and also to those of us who are struggling just with sexual brokenness in general you know as a father now to my son Jack I think about what kind of world do I want my son to live in the world is getting more and more broken day by day and now the world is embracing its sexual brokenness and glorifying it and so much of that brokenness has been around for a long time when I was growing up it was more hidden behind the scenes and that goes for every kind of sexual brokenness whether it be adultery or divorce or sex outside of marriage or any sexuality that doesn't line up with the sexual ethic that Jesus gives us in scripture these days sexual brokenness is much more out in the open especially in regards to the context of the episode that we talked about today and so I think about two reactions to that brokenness on the left side of the culture you have an attempt to deny that the brokenness even exists and it desired to baptize the brokenness and call it good and holy and righteous which we know leads to destruction and then on the right side you've got a fear and a loathing of that brokenness a hatred for those who struggle with it because of fear of what that brokenness will do to our society and the hyper fixation on one particular aspect of brokenness in a way that actually causes them to turn a blind eye to their own sexual brokenness and I don't see these two sides getting less extreme in how they operate I see it only increasing and so when I think of my son and I think of what kind of man do I want him to be? I want him to grow to be the kind of man who ultimately lays all of his brokenness down at the feet of Jesus and submits himself to walking in obedience while knowing deep in his bones that he is unconditionally loved unconditionally forgiven unconditionally embraced and welcomed to the table of Jesus. I want him to have an understanding of the brokenness on all sides of the equation and I want him to have an understanding of his own brokenness and then I want him to have a compassion both for those who struggle with brokenness and for himself because as much as he is this perfect little angel toddler baby at the moment he is human and I know just like me and every other human before him he will struggle because of this I'm so thankful for guys like Peter who have this moral courage and integrity to say hey this is a problem and we need to talk about it but then also the compassion to say let's talk about in a way that builds a bridge instead of a wall because the reality is what Peter believes the historic Christian sexual ethic is alienating that's just the reality the reality is no matter how compassionate he or I present that message it's still going to make a large majority of people in today's culture who hear that message it's going to make them upset and offended and deeply disturbed because it is disturbing to be called out on your sin it's disturbing to hear that part of your human condition is broken and so my thought is because the message of that truth is already alienating why wouldn't we bend over backwards to present it in the most compassionate way possible not compromising the truth but not being skimpy on the grace these days there's a growing movement that fears grace because it worries that grace will open up the door to compromise but my thought is if we are just abundantly clear about what we mean and what we don't mean then we can let the grace flow like a rivers of water we can lead with compassion as Christ himself was compassionate on us when he went to the cross so this is another episode that we decided to break up into two the reason I'm doing that is because I realize that in episode that is an hour and 30 minutes long some of you guys probably aren't going to listen to the whole thing I know that because sometimes that's how I am with podcasts that I love and I just think this content is too good for you to miss so we're going to break up the flow give you some breathing room to pray through the things you heard on this episode and then on the next one we're going to jump right back in and get into some of the pushback when I told several of my pastor friends that I was going to be interviewing Peter because Peter isn't very well known in the Calvary Chapel tribes some people were understandably concerned and had some pushback even just taking a look at Peter's social media account cause some to have some questions and some concerns and now that Peter is taking the time to establish where he's coming from and who he is and what he's about and what he's not about I think the next episode will be a great place for him to build off that foundation and dive into responding to some of that pushback I just have to say in advance I think you guys are really going to love what Peter has to say honestly out of everyone I've ever interviewed I found him to be one of the most balanced guys of all time I feel like the way he navigated the pushback just blew my mind surprised me shocked me and encouraged me it maybe want to be better at how high handle pushback in my own life so hopefully that's a good enough commercial for the next episode I hope you guys will keep your eyes peeled for it don't miss it thank you for listening to another episode of the Good Line podcast we hope this episode has encouraged and challenged you to keep your eyes fixed on Jesus our goal and heart for the show is to always be pointing you to the God who is not safe but who is very very good if you enjoyed this show we would so appreciate it if you would leave us a review on Apple podcast or your podcast app of choice the more reviews we get the more people are able to find the show so please leave a review it helps so much the good line podcast is produced by myself Aaron Salvado and my co-host Brian Higgins and we are a part of CGN Media for more great content visit cgnmedia.org for more from good line ministries you can also find tons of podcast resources courses and more at our ministries website goodline.org if you'd like to support the work that we do please visit goodline.org slash support with your help we can continue pointing people to Jesus and providing thought provoking resources for thanks so much for joining us we hope this episode helped you on your journey of following Jesus and until next time keep your eyes fixed on him.
