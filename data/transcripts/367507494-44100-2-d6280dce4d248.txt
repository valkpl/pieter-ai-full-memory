 Well, thanks everyone for joining in to theology with friends. I'm here with a new friend. I've been saying that a lot lately, but his name is Peter, and it is spelled with an eye, but it's a silent eye, and I just learned that as well. So yeah, thank you so much for coming on, man. Yeah, glad to be here. Thanks for having me on the podcast, Paxton. Yeah, yeah. So I told you before that, somehow we followed each other on Instagram. I really don't know how it happened, but I went on your Instagram, and I saw two phrases that were like, grab my attention, and I told you this already. But the first one is you teach churches how to love gay people, and then helping sell a bit, Christians find family, right? Is that? Yeah. So I maybe it was like, okay, that's pretty intense. I'm going to follow. And yeah, just recently the past month, I've been following you and keeping up. So yeah, I just love if you would give a little bit about yourself who you are, and then we'll jump in from there. I've got a lot of questions. So I'll let you jump in. Yeah, so I'm a kind of like a writer and speaker about discernment and vocational singleness and LGBT plus topics, according to historic sexual ethics. I'm a bit in publishing places like Christianity today and near orthodoxy and work with over 85 different churches and Christian universities and campus ministries. I'm the founder and executive director of a quip, which is a premier consulting and training solution for churches, aspiring to be places where LGBT plus people thrive according to historic sexual ethics and we've trained over 28,000 Christian leaders. And then I am a teacher and aspiring deacon in the Anglican Church in North America and focus a lot on celibacy and sexuality topics. I'm a one of two founding brothers of the Nashville family of brothers, which is kind of like an ecumenically Christian monastery building lifelong family in Nashville for men called to vocational singleness. And then I'm a licensed professional counselor and I specialize in serving gay Christians hoping to steward their sexuality according to historic sexual ethics. So I've got a juggle and a variety of things in my work week and in my life. That's a smattering of them. Yeah, yeah. So there's a couple there. Maybe if you could tell your story of, I don't know, come into the faith and then dealing with the same sex attraction stuff or what, and before we get started, I'll just say, I don't know what I'm talking about here. I'm just asking questions. Okay, curious. And I mean, we'll just I'll just take this as my my equipment consultation. Sure. We're learning together. We're learning together. Yeah. So yeah. So each of my jobs has to do with sexuality and finding belonging in the body of Christ and all this work matters to me because I am a Christian and I am gay. I experience same sex attractions and I'm into a historic sexual ethic and I'll say that when I say historic sexual ethics, what I mean is a belief that God's best for every Christian is either what I call vocational singleness, which is a lifetime vocation of abstinence, singleness for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention or Christian marriage, which Christians have historically understood to be a lifetime vocation of the opposite sex Christian marriage with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom. So, so that's kind of what I believe. But yeah, it's been a journey for me to like get to that place for me personally. I mean, yeah, before college, I was like ashamed of being gay. I was afraid others would find out and treat me poorly because of that. Between the ages of like 13 and 23, I've read hundreds of prayers, I went to hundreds of hours of counseling with a therapist who thought that he could change my sexual orientation, spent nine months working for I pray the gay away ministry, but like still okay. I still experience same sex attraction. I also felt really alone because I didn't think that was anyone out of like me. Like I grew up being taught by TV and culture that like a pretty horrible stereotype of gay people that that gay people all went to group sex parties all had AIDS, they were all addicted to drugs, none of them wanted anything to do with God. Like that's what I was growing up. So based on that image, I didn't think I belonged with gay people. But then on the other side, all of the Christians that I knew were straight or so I thought. So I was like the belief that like in order for me to be a good Christian, I had to be straight but come straight or maybe I could just never be a good Christian. You know and then there was me like stuck in this no-man's land in between these two things and I'm like it didn't belong anywhere. But thankfully like out of that loneliness, a desire to really be known and loved, grew. So you know, sharing this part of my story has then up mixed bag, particularly when I started sharing in college like for example, throughout college I devoted myself to a campus ministry and I was followed. I followed every instruction of my mentor. I led Bible studies. I represented the organization to the university. I planned recruitment efforts. Like I did everything I was asked. I was given every reason to believe that I could go on staff with that campus ministry after college if I desired. And then without warning I was told not to apply to go on staff with that campus or any university where they had a location. And the only explanation given to me was we don't know what to do with you and your same six attractions. Wow. Thankfully, most of us wanted to actually do my story with a lot of love and compassion. For example, during my sophomore year of college, there was a gay brother in the Christian fraternity that I was a part of who was kind of confronted about having sex with his boyfriend. He left our fraternity. And in response to that, I took the scary step of sharing my story with the entire fraternity that I was a part of. I wanted straight brothers to know how to better love people like me. And I wanted brothers who were gay to know that they weren't alone. And after I shared my fear of being shunned turned to joyful surprise as brother after brother lined up to give me a hug and opened their phone to schedule a meal to get to know me better. And like these men honestly, like embody Jesus better from you than any church ever had. So yeah, so after sharing with that fraternity, a number of those guys actually shared with me that they were gay and that they had some of the beliefs of me and a similar story and that sometimes I was the first person they'd ever shared with and we started making sense of life together. And really out of that, I realized that all of us were afraid of following Jesus because we were afraid that like following Jesus' teachings would mean we would be alone for a lifetime. And none of us had parents or pastors who knew like what to do with us, like knew how to help us. And so by my senior year in college, although I'd gotten into medical school, I just couldn't shake the feeling that God instead wanted me to go to full-time ministry. Helping churches better love gay people like me. So that's why I got my masters in counseling. So I could provide better one of one pastoral care. And that's when I started the quit in 2014 with the mission of equipping parents and pastors to better love and serve gay people according to historic sexual ethics. And then in 2018, I helped start the national family brothers to offer me like me, lifelong lived in family. So that's kind of yeah, that's the story of like how I've gotten to the things I do today. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that's awesome. And I wanted to ask a little more, did you so did you grow up Christian as well? Like your whole life or was okay? Did you when did you start to like notice like, oh, I'm experiencing like attraction to the same sex, you know, sixth grade. Yeah, sixth grade. Yeah, and that's pretty common age. I mean these days it's gonna be earlier or it can be fourth fifth grade for guys. It can be even earlier for girls because girls and average go through puberty before guys do. So the ages are pretty young. And then some would share that even before they go through puberty, even in their like early elementary school years, some say they just they feel this sense they're like drawn to people of the same sex in a way that's different than the way they're drawn to people that the opposite sex. And eventually a romantic or sexual element is added to that when they go through puberty. But like they can remember, there was something different even before they went through puberty. So that wasn't the case for me, but you know, some people share that's that's their story. Yeah, yeah, I think before we get into maybe the the modern monastery. Yeah, I think you're doing, which is really cool. I kind of just want to dive deeper into, you know, there's people now, maybe that don't understand I come from the south and so we don't talk about LGBT, Q-Stuff, really at all. And some people don't understand, you know, the whole being attracted not being like a choice. You know, and I guess part of the modern debate on it is that you know, you should be able to pray the gateway. And I don't know how that's still a thing. But yeah, I guess could you show your thoughts on that? Because I know there's some like some people right now that are very well known that would say if you know you're having attractions, then you're like sinning without even acting on, you know, sort of a temptation. The same way that a straight person wouldn't act on a temptation, you know, if they're married and they have attraction to another girl and they don't act on that, you know. But you know, so yeah, if you just get to that's a little good. It's complicated. I'd say first, you know, if I talk to any straight person, I know, you know, person who exclusively experiences opposite sex attractions. And I asked them, well, when did you choose to be attracted to people of the opposite sex instead of people of the same sex? They say, like I said, never chose, I just woke up, started waking up in middle school and started realizing I felt this different kind of way towards those people of the opposite sex and I didn't feel that way toward people the same sex. And I wanted to connect with those people of the opposite sex, you know. And I said, and, you know, my response as well is the same for me, it's just when I woke up and I started noticing I felt something special about some people that was people of the same sex, you know, and I didn't choose it either, you know. Now, if the question of like whether or not we can pray the gay away, um, you know, first thing is even if we look in the scriptures, we see like Paul's story of the Thorne in his side. We see him begging God to take this affliction away. Whatever it was, you know, we don't know if it was a moral affliction in a physical ailment, we don't know what it was, right? But he's saying, like God, take this thing away. Okay, this thing that is brokenness, that is not what you intended for me. Please take it away. And he says he, he got to know or at least he didn't, it wasn't taken away, right? They didn't change. Yeah. And he, and he kind of used on why was that that God didn't take it away. And, and, you know, part of what he doesn't say, but I think we can intuit is that well, taking everything away that we ask isn't how God works. He's not, he's not a vending machine, you know. And we say that over all around scripture, sometimes you ask God for miracles, or you ask God for an everyday blessing, and he provides it. And sometimes you do, and he doesn't, because we don't own God, we don't tell God what to do, you know? And the, but the other thing that Paul got at directly, as he said, you know, Paul doesn't indicate anything about it being his fault that he has this Thorne in his flesh. But he, what he does say is that this Thorne in his flesh presents an opportunity for him to daily recognize that he's broken. Daily bring this reality of his brokenness to God, and daily depend on Jesus more. That is the biblical response to any kind of brokenness we're experiencing that we ask God to take away, and he doesn't. It is not to shame ourselves, it is not to say, well, Paul just didn't pray hard enough, you know? Paul only prayed three times, maybe Paul should have prayed three thousand times, and maybe God wouldn't take it that far away. I think this is Paul. Paul is just sitting. That's that's like that's not how it he Christian had turned over that passage, right? Our takeaway is you make an earnest effort to ask God to take some things away, and maybe he doesn't anytime, maybe he doesn't ever, maybe he doesn't for a long time, regardless, in the meantime, our posture is not kind of bidding ourselves over backwards of why is this thing not changing? Is it because I'm not praying hard enough? And instead is saying, okay, what kind of learn from this? This daily reminder that I am not how God first intended me to be, and I need Jesus to be faithful in everything. And I'll say, you know, there is scientific research about sexual orientation change efforts, you know, people who have gone to ministries or therapists that kind of offered different strategies and attempts that sexual orientation change, different pray the gay away kind of solutions, ex-gay solutions. And the research shows that somewhere between 96 and 97% of individuals who participated in those efforts experienced no meaningful change in their same sex attractions. Wow, 96 to 97% experience, no meaningful change in their same sex attractions. Now, could some of them learn to resist temptation more effectively? Yes, but that's different than changing your attractions. That's different from all of a sudden going from finding Brad Pitt attractive to finding Angelina, Julia attractive or whatever, you know, thinking of a Hollywood pair, you know. That's different than you built up greater strength to resist left-wing, left-wing, after Angelina, Joly or left-wing after Brad Pitt. That's a different kind of thing, right? 96 to 97% did not experience any meaningful change in kind of what kind of people they're attracted to. But the same research found that people who participated in those sexual orientation changes efforts experienced a 92% increase in their suicidality. So experienced almost kind of doubling in the frequency or magnitude of their suicide kind of attempts or ideation. So in effect of changing sexual orientation, really effective at increasing depression and suicidality. So I just think if you're a parent, if you're a pastor, if you're a therapist, you look at that data, and you also look at the story of the Thorn and Paul side. I think our takeaway is torturing people with shaming them that not praying hard enough to remove the Thorn and their side is their faults, leads to depression and suicide. And that's not the solution. Yeah. But instead, if we follow the wisdom of scripture, which is, to accept for a season or for a lifetime, this Thorn may remain in my flesh, how has God asking me to respond to whatever temptation it presents by being faithful? And what do I need to do that on a daily basis, daily surrender to Jesus and surrender my brokenness to Jesus? That's what we're culture. And I think that's what people who experience same sex attraction or any kind of temptation are our cultures. Man, man, that's good. Um, I know for a fact that have some listeners that are on the other side of the theological question of is it wrong to, or affirming not affirming that whole. I know I have some listeners that maybe are affirming. I don't even know exactly what my question is. I think what I'm struggling with is, you know, studying scripture for myself and studying all different kinds of outlooks and views on it. And, you know, come into that conclusion that, you know, a traditional sex ethic or orthodox whatever you may call it, you know, is what Jesus intended. But knowing that it hurts to tell people that, or even, you know, some people would even go as far to say, like, you believe in that is, you know, violent or bad or whatever. And I know that's overboard, but it's still happening. You know, I guess, and I'm not going to say they hold the scripture less than me or whatever, anything like that. But, you know, for somebody that is trying to hold a hold scripture and, you know, do that. How can I, how am I supposed to, you know, talk to people if they ask, because I never would probably never go up somebody and say, I believe in a traditional same sex, whatever, you know, you don't, whatever. But, you know, what, how does that conversation, I mean, usually even come to some sort of edifying thing for maybe writing me, whatever? Because I'm finding that really scary, really hard. Yeah, totally totally. Yeah. So I actually think debating about sexual ethics is a trap. It's a trap. It's all right. In here's why. Because I think our views about sexual ethics are rarely, really fundamentally about our views about sexual ethics. There are about the ways we answer some more fundamental questions of fate. The ways we answer those more fundamental questions of fate. Basically, determine what views we're going to have about sexual ethics. And disagreement about sexual ethics is so emotionally loaded these days that if we can instead kind of back to truck up a little bit and instead talk about our disagreements about the more fundamental questions of fate, which is the source of our disagreement about sexual ethics anyway, and it's more important yet, somehow, actually less controversial, less emotionally loaded and therefore can lead to more productive conversation. That's my recommendation. And so here's where I'd say those more fundamental questions are where we disagree. Or let me say it this way. There's three questions that I like to ask someone. And if we agree on these three questions, we usually agree on sexual ethics. And if we disagree about these three questions, we often disagree about sexual ethics. And these questions have nothing to do with sexual ethics. And they are one, do you believe a God exists? Do you believe a God exists? They say yes. Okay. We got a line on that. If they say no, good chance we might have different views on sexual ethics. That is nothing to do with whether or not I love gay people or you love gay people. As a deal with the fact that we have a fundamentally different view of reality. Okay. Second question. Do you believe that that God knows what's best for you and me better than you and me now? What's best for us? Okay. So someone agrees with something on that. We got, we got a line on that question. Or if someone says, if they think, you know, the God, whatever the God is or God's it exists are not all, I'll powerful and all knowing. And all good. And that God doesn't really know what's better for me than I view. I know what's better for me than I do. Then we're probably going to have different conclusions about sexual ethics. But it's because of that more fundamental difference. Okay. Yeah. So let's say we agree. God exists. God knows what's best for us better than we do. But the third question, is the way we know what that God's best for us is? Is the way we answer that question, what is God's best for me? By reading the Scriptures with the historic church. Do we know God's best for us? By reading the Scriptures with the historic church? We both enter yes to that third. It's all three of those questions including that third question. We usually agree on sexual ethics. We just do. We usually do that now. There's signs, there are their anomalies. I don't want to say 100% usually read the Scriptures with the historic church. It's hard to come to two different conclusions about sexual ethics. disagree on answer to that question. Not surprising. We come to different conclusions about sexual life. So, yeah. Again, that's just my recommendation. If you feel like you're in conversation with somebody, you're about to run into the LGBT-plus sexual ethics argument trap. Pause. And say, I particularly dare trying to bait you into that. They're trying to drag you into that. Say, hey, I'm hearing that that caring for gay people, LGBT-plus people means a lot. It matters to you. I'm hearing that you think Christians and just humans should get it right. Like how we treat LGBT-plus people. And particularly Christians should get it right. What has God's love and wisdom for LGBT-plus people? I totally agree. Before we talk about that, can we just like, can I just like see how Twitter said we line up on a couple of these other questions? More fun on the questions of faith. Just before we get there, you know. And you ask in those three questions. And in particular, if you get to that third question and you're like read the scriptures with a historic church. And they're like read the scriptures for yourself and whatever you think is reasonable or read the scriptures for yourself, however, the Holy Spirit leaves you to interpret it or whatever different answer is. Then you say, okay, now when we may end up coming to different conclusions about sexual ethics, but could you imagine, like, you know, you think you in the Holy Spirit, I think I need to submit to the wisdom of the church, the consistent, whatever the consensus of the historic church is, could you see how we could come to really fundamentally different conclusions about sexual ethics? That is nothing to do with whether or not one of us loves LGBT-plus people more or less, you know. Yeah, just totally lowers the volume in the room, lowers the temperature in the room. So yeah, I actually really like that a lot. Because then the blame for if we differ on something is not on how they are, like if they are same sex-directed, the blame of me disagreeing isn't on them as a person that's on these other fundamental things. Which it's true, it does trace back to those. Now, what would you say, because I am egalitarian, be true to this, whatever, any other word for not commentary and I guess from my view of the historical church, egalitarianism or women as equal to men in that regard, as far as the historic church goes, I don't know actually, my first thought is that it's probably not egalitarian or whatever in that regard. What would say about that for that third question? I do think that third question is very important for answering this second topic. But I do still go a little bit there because yeah. Yeah, so it's tricky. It's tricky. So the Catholic church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, right, are there to, you know, they're the oldest expressions of the church. Yeah. And the generally the the view of the Eastern Orthodox Church has been that on whether or not particularly men can be priests, whether women can be priests, whether women can be staff for the women can be bishops. Their view is not that they know that it is dogma or that it must be so or that it's improving to be so that only men can be priests. Their claim is we just have a tradition of only men being priests. But we are open-handed about whether or not it must be true or it is certainly true that only men can be priests. So they're kind of, they're kind of skeptical, you know, about it and they just say, hey, we're defaulting tradition, but we're not going to make an argument that like only men like theologically morally, ethically, only men can be priests. Yeah. And the stuff about the priests is up all fun translating to the household, you know, and whether men can be pastors, men have to be heads of the household, women can be pastors, men and women can both be equally heads of the household kind of stuff. Yeah. And within the Catholic Church, you know, there's been some consistent teaching and particularly one of the things that like has really grounded the Catholic teaching about that is, is nothing to do with kind of an inferiority of women or a less-than-ness of women kind of based on some kind of first Timothy passage. Instead what they kind of defend their historic theology on is that the priest is standing in for Christ and therefore must be male because Christ was male. The in persona Christy like argument for why men must be priests. And the Catholic Church of Recky Nies that like that is a development of doctrine that was not present in the Orthodox Church is post-great schism. And so it doesn't have the same weight as things where there was complete unity priest, schism. Like the particular theological argument, you know, as well there are some compelling claims on arguments that one of the first apostles, there's a apostle mentioned in the scripture's named Junia or you can be translated into variety from this. There's arguments why that, why the most rigorous kind of grammatical understanding of the passage of mentions that is that it's a female named Junia who wasn't a apostle. Yeah. And there's lots of kind of building scholarship around that. You know, the priests today get their authority from the bishops. Bishops today get their authority from the apostles. If there was a female apostle, then you could have female bishops and female priests and have been probably female heads of household, right? Like yeah. And there's other examples of like women being leaders in the early church. But like there's this strong argument that like well if the early church approved of women being apostles, then the the early church consensus, the early church teaching, is the women can be priests. And you know, the argument has never been that the consensus of this historic church is perfect or incontrovertible. It's that it should be trusted unless there was compelling evidence in scripture to contradict it. Or come, okay. Yeah. And so if we have compelling evidence in scripture that like Junia wasn't a apostle and we and we're and we're misunderstanding kind of the tradition passed on to us from the early church. Yeah. The next that's a place where the church can say whipsy and I don't think that envelope the invalidness the credibility of the historic church generally, right? Yeah. Very last thing I'll say is that there is a really good book by an author named William Webb called Slaves Women in Homosexuals. And it's very on the nose title. And in the book he argues that that there's actually a way that the scripture is treat slavery and women in leadership differently than it treats gay marriage essentially. Like that there's there's a trajectory in scripture that seems to suggest that God is kind of leading his people toward what we would now say is kind of modern wisdom around slavery and gender equality. Yeah. That is different than kind of a flatline in scripture of consistently teaching the same thing about same sexual activity. And so that the church and Christians maybe that they ought to kind of grow in some ways beyond scripture with the church in terms of our views about slavery and gender equality. Whereas the church should not keep the consistent kind of line and Christians should keep the consistent line of the scriptures as it comes to to whether same sexual activity is a sin in any context. Yeah. So that'd be my answer to that question. And I personally am also egalitarian and and and and my part of an anglic and die see that the Doredenes women to the priesthood. Oh, okay cool. Yeah. I was actually going to ask. I didn't know if the anglic in church had female priests. I don't know. Some do the anglic in churches in North America. It's a it's a die see by die see decision. What does it say? Okay by die see decision is die see a region. I literally know nothing about anglic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So kind of church is led by readers or priests or pastors are collected in regions called a die assess a die see. Yeah. And then an a bishop isn't charged with that collection of church. Okay. Okay. And I did see on one of your stories. Gotcha. I did see on your story one of your stories was talking of was it the anglic in church that was voting on if the same sex attracted person could be a priest was that um yeah. Yeah. Years ago there was some some kind of deliberations. It was more about like whether or not what's the preferred kind of language terminology, verbage for uh anglicans in the ACNA's context. You can't use to describe people who experience same sex attraction and yeah. And what what words to use in a misological context versus what words to use talking to talking within our parishes and talking with kids and and it kind of about whole and kind of conversation about that. Yeah. Yeah. I've um I've been interested by that conversation as well. And I and I think you know when I was in the south people would be like you know if you're Christian and you're choosing to be a celibate or you know you end up finding out or getting married to you know if you're a man you're a woman even though you're sex attracted to get married to a woman. You know if you're choosing a traditional sex ethic don't don't call yourself gay like you're going against that that's the whole point and not and then so like you can say you yeah you should put this big tagline wherever you say you experience same sex attraction but you know you don't act on it or whatever instead of just saying like I'm a gay Christian and I don't you know I I'm so I've given much thought to it um it I guess being in the being more north more northern when somebody says gay Christian um it does I mean it does mean something different than if somebody in the south said gay Christian because in the north you know where I am if you're a gay Christian you probably you know are affirming or things like that so I guess I kind of get it um is there you know what how would you it's drinking yeah yeah there's a whole website that we can add to the the show notes or whatever uh there's a whole article that I wrote on like why I use the word gay it describe myself and and in kind of for ministry purposes um and but I would say the short and suite of it is um there are no best words like there are no perfect words to use to describe that mean the same thing to everybody and has no baggage for anyone right and that's the challenge of this is like for example by use the word gay right um teenagers high middle schoolers high schoolers today young adults they don't assume they don't assume the word gay community communicates anything about a person's theological convictions or relational status they just like yeah well he likes boys girl who likes girls that's all gay means nothing more right whereas I use the word gay like you know in in maybe my church with an older generation and they assume maybe even all of those worst stereotypes about gay people that told you earlier right about the sex and drugs and alcoholism and hating Jesus you know um number verse you know if I use if I just said I was I'm a Christian who experiences or struggles with same sex attraction there might be some older generations of my church who say yeah I like that you know that's that's making clear who you are and who you aren't you know that's kind of saying it is really plainly like experiencing sex attraction you know that's simple I like it you know yeah um but but but there's also kind of a generation of us who who went to pray the gay way therapist or pray the gay way camps like me who know that that phrase seems sex attraction was popularized by the ex-gay movement and by the prayer the gay way movement and for us that phrase strongly associated with those painful pray the gay experiences we had the we're ineffective and led to a doubling of suicide yeah yeah and and even for younger generations who themselves haven't directly experienced that pray the gay way movement they you know they've watched movies like boy raised and like the the mis-education of camera posts and they're on queer TikTok and they're kind of learning from older generations of queer people you know hey people who use this phrase same sex attraction they want to pray the gay way they want to send you to a therapist who will do shock therapy with you to make you straight if anyone uses this phrase same sex attraction run the other direction and so what that means is there's no word or phrase I could use with every context with every audience in every context that works yeah and that I think that's the challenge that's a challenge yeah that's tough I mean I was just choose to not offend gay people and just offend the people who are being left sure yeah I was like with mixed audience like that's that's yeah you know that's what I that's what I default to is I call myself a gay Christian who's committed to a historic sexual ethic you know and I even find what historic sexual ethics is that's what I did at the top of this podcast yeah but but yeah but if I'm talking to a group of exclusively like 60 year old Christians I may say something different if I'm talking to a group of exclusively like non-Christians in their teens or young adults I might not lead with my sexual ethic but I may come to that later in in the presentation you know and we're with some careful subtle ways you know so yeah I think real I mean that that's you know your your your due to vanity right so that you know those of us who are in training for ministry a lot of it is you know know your audience and kind of almost like a form of like code switching so yeah yeah man that's so interesting which is a dishonest right it's it's just being strategic and now strategic and a deceitful way we see in scriptures that Jesus responds definitely to different kinds of groups of people you know you pay attention to his audience that's not that's caring that's kindness yeah well I think just a couple of minutes but I love sure if you talked a little bit about the Nashville family of brothers and I'll say that again yes Nashville family brothers that it's funny sometimes people slip up and then I'll like national family of brothers yes Nashville band of brothers I don't know if you get a lot of things yeah that was a good one yeah yeah yeah Nashville family of brothers I mean in some of that even in the name communicate some of what we got going on in Nashville okay and and we're brothers we're dudes we're you know and brothers maybe in a you know since a like brothers in Christ but also make brothers in a monastery kind of thing well or a family of brothers and so so yeah you know we there are are to be clear we have normal jobs out in our community we are still connected to different local churches and we are still connected to families our biological families and families in our neighborhood in our church as a kid like we're not cloistered we're not all going to the same church our home is not our workplace or our church you know yeah but we're a monastery in other ways in that we we pray together every morning before we go to work and we have a certain number of meals together family meals together each week and we do a time of kind of a prayer worship together once a month and we do confession and accountability together and we do holidays and vacations together like we we we alternate the big holidays thanks giving the Christmas is with our national family of brothers or with our biological families and and as we and we live together in a house and do life together like a family as we are also are discerning whether God is calling us to make one year or three year or lifetime commitments to this family and it's it's a home you know and so yeah what we're really trying to do is it's to build and to offer real life long lived in family to mid and call to vocational singleness and that's been called the vocational singleness regardless of sexual orientation we've got some guys in our house who are gay some guys in our house who are bisexual some guys in our house are straight some guys in our house who are like a little bit closer or something more like asexual but you know it's this isn't a gay thing or an LGBT plus thing this is just an any dude is a Christian if he was called to singleness for the sake of the kingdom and I'd say while we all have different jobs outside of our house we all believe that God is calling us to vocational singleness he is calling us to leverage particularly our our nine to five job for the sake of the kingdom you know because we don't have to make as much money to support kids or to support a family of young and shared expenses it's cheaper then we can kind of spend we can kind of risk getting paid less to do those some of those things that bring forth the kingdom most quickly the bring healing to our communities that serve the poor in the needy in our world most directly so that's what we're about yeah that's really cool I read that on going deeper into the website about how you know focusing on I can't worry put it exactly but do leveraging your singleness unlike somebody with a family and things like that because I mean that's so true I I felt called to past or ministry for you know past six or past eight years and I mean that's always been a question and a struggle is like I can do this ministry but I'm gonna need to make sure and and for me it hasn't deterred it hasn't changed much but I know people where it has and some people even often leaving ministry because or not able to do the job or keep their family or whatever happens because it could be paid enough so I really I mean that kind of like warmed me a little bit that's yeah that's really cool and I think we're not we're not trying to say that that people call the vocational singleness are better Christians or super Christians or whole-year people you know I think I think parents you know couples Christian Christian marriages that are raising kids one that work of raising kids is really important kingdom work it's super essential kingdom work you know like if someone's not doing that kingdom work eventually nothing oh other kingdom we're just gonna get done you know yeah that's the most important one in some ways and I'm not trying to say that the parents can't do other kingdom work other than raising the kids but at least what I hear from my my Christian friends who are parents and their raising you know three four five six kids is that it's just it's a lot of time and energy to do that kingdom work and they don't have a lot left in the tank to do a whole lot of other kingdom work and and what I want those parents to hear is that there's no shame in that there's no shame in that right and I think sometimes the disservice our churches do they don't teach about the kind of singleness in Matthew 19 and first Corinthians seven they're not helping people dissering whether they're called to that and so our churches don't have enough people committed to vocational singleness and where that extra availability to maybe do some of the work inside and outside of our churches that that maybe parents don't have the time and energy to do and then instead our churches shame parents for not doing everything yeah and and and I think that's just I don't only have to care and well for for our churches and for our parents and I think the solution is really is to to offer singleness to more people so yeah well that's so cool yeah if anybody any of my listeners is interested in any of this which I just want to say I love you know everything you're doing it's just like it feels very all encompassing like whole and sure even the fact that you still are talking about parents and kids when you know that your life is not that and you still are caring for people you know in that way and yeah just yeah I've loved it and I hope that you know my listeners can dig in a little bit and see and who knows you know even my listeners in the south maybe somebody down there is maybe called to a called a vocational singleness we I'm only joking because I grew up where it was like you get married and marriages your savior and that's a whole note yeah I grew up in northeast Tennessee so I got I got plenty of it yeah so yeah crazy stuff but well I appreciate you coming on and I hope to stand touch and just keep doing what you're doing I appreciate it and I'm sure my listeners will as well great yeah thank you so much for the
