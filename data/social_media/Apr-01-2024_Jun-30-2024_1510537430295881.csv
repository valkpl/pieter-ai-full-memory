Why would anyone want to be a part of a church that calls him or her to inconvenient stewardship of any kind? It seems to me that Jesus is particularly interested in the lonely.
Those who are yearning for thicker community.

People who are disillusioned with the brokenness of the world and looking for an opportunity to make the world better alongside others. So be a be a church that offers that.

Cultivate family in the body of Christ better than people can find anywhere else that invites the lonely in and loves them deeply. 

Challenge your church to prioritize serving the poor and needy in your city, and then invite purposeless people to be on mission with you to bring forth Christ's kingdom.

Basically, offer something so compelling and so beautiful that individuals will want to continue to be a part of your church despite other aspects they strongly disagree with.

When I play back the tape on a lot of conversations from the past decade that ended in others feeling unheard, disrespected, and misunderstood, many of them would have gone better if I had just chosen to turn the cheek.

But turning the cheek is hard for me. Maybe it's difficult for you, too.

To be clear, when Jesus talks about turning the cheek, he's talking about responding to insult. He's referring to times when someone offends you or falsely accuses you.

But I'm probably not a victim as often as I think I am.

Too often, I've felt ""offended"" when I was probably in the middle of hurting the other person much more than they were hurting me. I've resisted turning the cheek, particularly when I've thought it meant I had to become a doormat. Plus, I've resisted turning the cheek because I'm a broken person who puts my own needs above others', resists criticism, and struggles with entitlement and distrust.

In the moment, I failed to fully see my own responsibility. I failed to see how others felt intimidated, silenced, and bulldozed.

Some reading this who've been on the other end of conflict with me are all too familiar.

Thankfully, I brought this up with my mentor recently, and he pointed me to Dallas Willard's understanding of Christ's words. Willard offered a simple equation:

Turn the cheek = Stay vulnerable + Practice restraint

In the past I've often hidden my tender parts from myself and from others. I've hidden my fears and sadness because it didn't feel safe. So I showed up in cold, calculated ways and unwittingly wielded logic as a weapon.

Or I connected with more of my emotions, experienced fear that my tender parts would be mistreated by another, and then threw up high and thick defensive walls by puffing up as big as I felt like I had a right to.

I defended myself as much as I felt like was ""fair"" to make myself feel as safe as possible as quickly as possible. Often, I over-connected with my anger, leaving others feeling overwhelmed and intimidated.

Instead I need to stay vulnerable and practice restraint… [con’t in comments]",0,"04/10/2024 08:19",https://www.instagram.com/p/C5lfJ9xr4oI/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,2099,100,4,,7,18

A blurb recently appeared on the Yale University Press website for a new book by Dr. Richard Hays and his son (out Sept 2024) in which it seems he'll reveal his change to a revisionist sexual ethic.

Like me, many Christians over the past few decades have read Hays's 1996 ""Moral Vision of the New Testament"" and referred back to his earlier work to justify our commitment to historic sexual ethics.

When theological heavyweights like Hays change their minds, it's disorienting for many. For me, it led to a now all-too-familiar cycle of fear, disappointment, betrayal, and hope.

I say ""now all-too-familiar"" because Hays is just another in a line of trusted teachers who have changed their minds. I've not yet read Hays's new book and don't know anyone who has, but my hunch is it won't have much new to say.

Every time one of these books comes out, some part of me gets my hopes up that it'll present a truly compelling argument. But then it doesn't. At this point, I expect to be underwhelmed.

I think what's most difficult about news like this is that it feels like another case of churches and leaders serving straight people at the expense of gay people.

For decades, gay people have wanted to obey God and draw near to His presence. We didn’t ask the Church to abandon God’s teachings. We just asked the Church to notice our feeble hearts and minds—broken by the wounds of the closet—and carry us a little closer to God.

But for generations, the Church refused because its leaders were afraid to make straight people uncomfortable. Instead, they coddled the homophobia of the masses.

Fast forward to the present, homophobia has waned and been replaced by straight embarrassment with God’s wisdom. Many churches have once again responded by serving straight people at the expense of gay people.

They ignored the painful cries of generations of gay people who just wanted help following God’s wisdom. Yet when straight people start feeling mild discomfort from having to defend God's wisdom at dinner parties, churches are willing to abruptly abandon that wisdom.

Thankfully, there's hope…

You guys know that I don’t think our beliefs or behavior around sexual ethics is a salvation issue. There are people I disagree with about gay marriage, gay romance, and gay sex who will be in heaven.

I recently shared about that at a church. While the head pastor and I were later debriefing the training, he asked me an honest question: if it’s not a salvation issue, why not just be with a man?

Why not have your cake and eat it too?

I said, “Well, because I actually believe this stuff! I actually believe that following God’s wisdom will lead to the best life possible for me.

“I think leaning into vocational singleness, leveraging my availability to find deep meaning and satisfaction in my kingdom work, and helping build an intentional Christian community where I find lifelong lived-in family (that’s just as love filled as any marriage) will all lead to a much better life than if I chased gay romance and marriage.

“I don’t think God’s wisdom about gay sex is arbitrary. I don’t think that God is holding out on something good on me. 

“I’m convinced by the Scriptures and by personal experiences that God knows what He’s talking about. I touched the hot stove and I got burned!

“So far, following historic sexual ethics has seemed to lead to better things in my life than the people I’ve seen abandoning God’s wisdom over the past 15 years.

“I don’t think there’s an option to have one’s cake and eat it too. Ultimately like all opportunities and invitations like that, it’s a trap.

I recently posted a video sharing why I think God's wisdom for our sexualities is worth following (Proverbs 4:6-7, Matthew 7:24-25).

I made a passing comment at the start of the video that I don't believe gay sex is a salvation issue. Some were surprised, so I wanted to explain.

First, any suggestion that same-sex sexual sin is worse or less forgivable than greed or idolatry or any other sin is inconsistent with the Scriptures. And often homophobic.

Second, while the Scriptures warn that sexual sin seems to impact the sexual sinner more, the Scriptures never suggest that Christ's work on the cross atones for sexual sin any less.

So setting those aside, let's talk more generally about whether a Christian who consciously and repeatedly refuses to repent for a specific sin loses their salvation.

Call me an old-fashioned evangelical, but I'm convinced that all a person needs to do to become a Christian is to privately confess to Jesus, ""I'm a sinner. I need a savior. Jesus, I want your forgiveness for all my sins past, present, and future. I want you to be the Lord of my life, even though I know I'll fail at that every day until I die or You return.""

And then I'd encourage the new believer to be baptized publicly as a public confession of their faith.

When I prayed that prayer years ago, I repented, in advance, for all sin I would commit and Jesus forgave, in advance, all sin I would commit.

If a person fails to repent of a specific sin in the future, I don't think their salvation is in jeopardy, because Jesus has already forgiven them for that sin. That's how big the love of Jesus is!

Some might respond, ""Are you saying there's nothing a person can do to lose their salvation? Nothing?""

I'm not a Calvinist. I don't believe in once-saved-always-saved. I also don't think Jesus revokes our salvation. Nor do I think there's anything another person or the Enemy can do to take our salvation from us.

The only person who can change our salvation status is ourselves. [...con’t in comments]",90,"04/25/2024 08:22",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6MG-nbLLOz/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,6423,291,52,10,61,101

You may have seen this demotivational poster of St. Sebastian in the background of one of my recent videos. I read about something similar in Eve Tushnet’s book “Tenderness” and I couldn’t resist designing and printing a version for myself.

The sarcasm and double meaning are deeply satisfying.

A quick glance might lead the viewer to think it’s merely a baroque image with a trite-yet-encouraging Christian message.

But then you notice that the image shows St. Sebastian, particularly known for his martyrdom. And the caption takes on new meaning.

We like the idea of trusting God when we assume that He’s got plans of worldly comfort, wealth, and prosperity for us. 

But what if God’s roadmap for us leads to martyrdom of some sort? What if He’s planned humiliation, pain, and abandonment for us?

Are you still interested? Am I?

A few weeks ago I was honored to speak at chapel for Asbury Theological Seminar about God's true, good, and beautiful for gay people. 

Too often, parents, siblings, and friends have noticed that what’s true doesn’t seem to be leading to good and beautiful in the lives of the LGBT+ people they know. 

Has this been your story? Your family's story? Your church's story?

We’ve got queer siblings, children, and friends who’ve tried mightily to steward their sexualities according to God's wisdom but have suffered mightily in the process.

Instead of thriving according to historic Christian sexual ethics, obedience to Christ’s truth has too often led to loneliness, depression, loss of faith, or loss of life for the LGBT+ people we love.

They tried harder than anyone else we know to make Jesus happy, but the pain of their striving seemed to leave Jesus feeling further and further away.

Something doesn’t fit.

Christians seem to know intuitively that what’s true should also be good and beautiful. So when it comes to sexual ethics, it’s not good enough for historic Christian sexual ethics to be (just) true.

If God's wisdom is truly true, then it should be leading to undeniably good and beautiful things in the lives of gay Christians who follow them. So how do we make that a reality?

Churches have got to do what it takes to bring the good within their reach of LGBT+ people. To get what's true to lead to good and beautiful for LGBT+ people, the Church must do what it takes to make a life of thriving accessible.

In particular, we've got to protect kids from the wounds of the closet, raise the bar for everyone’s sexual stewardship, and ensure singles find lifelong lived-in family.

In college and post-grad when Christian leaders shared testimonies about what they used to struggle with and celebrated God's provision, it was often implied (if not directly stated) that they no longer struggled.

I remember internally asking, ""At all?""

""All of the temptation is gone? You never slip up ever? Even a little?""

I never believed it. Do you?

Sometimes I worry that I unintentionally send the same signals.

When I talk about vocational singleness and resisting temptation and calling a sin a sin, I sometimes worry that others assume I've got it all figured out.

Maybe some roll their eyes in disbelief. Others perhaps lower their eyes in shame and worry that they’re the only person still struggling.

So I want to say clearly: I'm still a sinner.

Recovery is messy for everyone, including me. But progress is happening, and imma keep at it. You should too.

I've shared routinely about my sex addiction recovery. A decade ago I went to a flip-phone for a year. I’ve still got restrictions and accountability software on all my devices. 

A decade ago I began going to 12-step meetings. I still regularly attend. A decade ago I started going to therapy to uncover the roots of my lust. I’m still working with my therapist to address my real needs.

And I've made mistakes. As I consistently share when I give my testimony with pastors and churches, I have not always lived up to my commitments.

I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking that coming out on social media as a gay celibate Christian magically flips a switch leading to effortless abstinence.

I deeply regret every mistake I've made. I most regret how my mistakes have enabled others to ignore God's wisdom and bring pain upon themselves.

Thankfully, I’ve made significant progress. Recovery really works! It takes time and effort (and it's not overnight or perfect), but God is faithful to provide greater sobriety.

So if you've struggled with sexual addiction (regardless of your sexual orientation), and your recovery has been messy, please know that you're not alone. [...con’t in comments]",0,"05/16/2024 09:11",https://www.instagram.com/p/C7CRzFvLDlR/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,2405,326,23,1,35,33

I recently went on the Head to Heart Podcast with Jenny Marcum, and she opened with a question she asks many of her guests: What has Jesus freed you from?

If I’m honest, hearing the question brought back painful memories.

As a gay Christian committed to historic sex ethics, I’ve often been asked why God hasn’t yet freed me from my same-sex attractions.

Here's my answer:

I’ve been set free from the shame around my same-sex attractions and sexual addiction.
 
For a long time, I thought it was my fault that I was broken in these ways. I believed it was my job to find a way to make these feelings go away, and that if I failed, God wouldn't love me.
 
Thankfully, I have been set free from that belief.
 
Every day, I submit these broken parts of myself to Jesus, ask Him to help me obey His wisdom, and take practical steps advised by mentors.

I’ve also been set free from the idolatry of romance.

Everything around me tells me that I need romance and sex to be a happy and whole person. This message not only comes from secular spaces but also conservative cultural Christianity and Chritian spaces advocating for a revisionist sexual ethic.

Both extremes suggest that if I find the right person, I will no longer experience loneliness, and that a magical romantic connection is the best way to secure a stable family.

But those are lies. The Scriptures don’t support these claims, and neither do stats about relationships.
 
I now see that the idol of romance lies and overpromises, while the Scriptures and the practices of the early Church tell the truth. I don’t need romance or sex, but I do need lifelong, lived-in companionship.

I can find that in vocational singleness within the context of committed, intentional Christian community, just as much as anyone else.
And I’m deeply grateful God has help me find that…

In a recent sermon at Calvary the Hill Church in Seattle I shared about the difference between temporary and vocational singleness, and why we should consider vocational singleness instead of living in limbo. 

Temporary singleness is the default state everyone is born into, whereas vocational singleness is a lifetime vocation of singleness for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention.

Many in temporary singleness are waiting for marriage. Vocational singles, on the other hand, permanently give up the possibility of romance, marriage, sex, and biological children in order to use that availability for kingdom work that parents might struggle to find the time, energy, or financial freedom to do.

Plus, vocational singleness isn’t a call to loneliness. Vocational singles can still enjoy human intimacy in the context of committed, lifetime human family.

To be clear, God still blesses those in temporary singleness, and our churches should too. While God calls most to vocational singleness or Christian marriage, God calls some to walk in temporary singleness for decades or for a lifetime.

But, many in temporary singleness find it difficult to commit to spiritual families or kingdom work because they are waiting for a future marriage.

This struggle can lead to job dissatisfaction, unfulfillment in kingdom work, loneliness, and a sense of waiting for life to start. 

That’s why I encourage anyone walking out temporary singleness to earnestly discern whether God might be calling them to vocational singleness.

Where do we see this distinction in the Scriptures and the early Church?

Instead, churches offered (1) false hope of sexual orientation change (leading to suicidality and loss of faith), (2) taught that merely experiencing SSAs was a sin, (3) policed sexual identity language, (4) barred any with enduring SSAs from ministry, and (5) passed off gays to therapists/ministries instead of learning

In response to this rejection, gay people sought belonging elsewhere, and when they couldn't find it, they attempted to create it for themselves.

Gay Pride is a celebration, reminding gay people that they're valued and accepted. It's also intentionally showy (or even aggressive) to reassure gay people that they'll defend and protect each other.

So how can Christians respond compassionately?

1. Name and confess the sins of past Christians that led many to abandon Jesus and find family elsewhere.

2. When you see something Pride-related, practice asking yourself, ""How is this attempting to reassure gay people they're valued and that they'll be protected?""

3. Ask leaders in your church what they're offering to gay people. How is that similar or different from the false promises and destructive practices of the past?

What *can* you assume ""coming out"" means this Pride?

""In some way I'm either non-straight or don't fit neatly into cultural gender norms. Ask me more to learn more!""

When someone comes out publicly, they've likely processed privately for years or decades. 

On average, teens wait five years after internally recognizing same-sex attractions to share with a parent or pastor.

Why do people come out? To be fully known and fully loved.

While a person's sexuality isn't the most important aspect of their personhood, it is meaningful. Until an LGBT+ person shares about this part of their story, they aren't sure where they'll be fully loved when their story is fully known.

Plus, not having to keep one's sexuality a secret anymore can alleviate stress, lead to more genuine friendships, help teens connect with peers of similar experiences, and foster healthier intimacy with God.

So if you're a Christian and one of your friends comes out today, lean in. Ask them to share more about what that means. Ask them what painful experiences have led them to hesitate sharing earlier.

And then listen.

""Why do we even have to talk about this stuff?!""

First and foremost, Christians should care about LGBT+ people (particularly during pride month) because God made them in His image and deeply cherishes them.

LGBT+ people deserve dignity and community.

Second, Christians should care about LGBT+ people because they’re in our families. At 5-10% of the population, the chances of a family having at least one LGBT+ kid is high. We must learn how to offer them Christ’s love and wisdom.

Third, Christians should care about LGBT+ people because the gospel depends on it.

When non-Christians are surveyed about their hesitancy to get to know Jesus, they consistently report Christian's perceived mistreatment of gay people as their #1 barrier.

Plain and simple, if churches learn to love LGBT+ people better according to God's wisdom, more people will come to know Jesus.

This Pride, lean into loving LGBT+ people (even when you’re weary) to honor their dignity as image bearers, for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the gospel.",0,"06/20/2024 08:55",https://www.instagram.com/p/C8cXyfXxMsf/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,9248,642,130,11,47,127

This season, Equip has been sharing stories of LGBT+ people and churches who experienced a disconnect between God's true, good, and beautiful.

Too many of our communities are places where historic sexual ethics don't seem to be leading to undeniably good and beautiful things in the lives of LGBT+ Christians straining to follow God's wisdom.

Something doesn’t fit.

But the solution isn't to abandon what's true. Instead, churches need to do what it takes to embody God's wisdom in ways that make God's good and beautiful accessible to LGBT+ people.

That’s why Equip has been raising $20,000 to empower more churches to offer LGBT+ people something more than JUST true. And thanks to generous supporters, every donation is matched up to $10,000.

Gratefully, people like you have already given $16,500 in regular donations and pledged matches, but we're still $3,500 short.

Would you consider pitching in $500 today or starting a recurring donation of $50/month to help us unlock the remaining matching funds?

Their church has realized that their fear of saying or doing the wrong thing when it comes to trans people has meant they've left teens and parents to figure this complex stuff out all on their own.

So the pastors are doing something about it.

They asked Equip to lead them through studying the relevant Scriptures, considering multiple perspectives on the key theological questions, and building consensus.

There were multiple times when we got to a tricky spot in discussion, but instead of letting fear get the best of them, one pastor or another reminded us that this was all about Christ's love for trans people.

Over and over again, they center the dignity of trans people and the demand on the church to love better.

It was super encouraging for us to see pastors care for trans people so deeply, and it filled us with hope for the theological and pastoral work they're doing.

THANK YOU to all of you who've been praying for the work of Equip and support us financially so we can train pastors like these.

Together, we're helping our churches become places where LGBT+ people experience more of God's love and wisdom!",85,"06/28/2024 10:06",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8xGINCx1Fm/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,2535,148,12,1,1,13

In the same way you share the gospel with anyone else!

LGBT+ people don’t need a different type of gospel or a different type of Jesus.

Sometimes people respond, ""Well, I guess I honestly don't know how to share the gospel with anyone unless the Holy Spirit has kind of teed me up for an easy home-run.""

There's no best way to share the gospel, but here's what I've noticed:

Honestly, outside of a powerful movement of the Holy Spirit, if their life is comfortable and seemingly fulfilled without knowing Jesus, then it might not be the right timing.

So develop friendship with them such that if they reach a point in life when they're deeply pained or unfulfilled and starting to ask big questions about how to make sense of the world and how to find meaning, you're one of the people in their life that they actually want to bring those questions to.

Then in the meantime, lean into family in the body of Christ and collaborate with Jesus to bring the kingdom to the poor and needy in your city, so your friends actually see Jesus in your life!",83,"04/03/2024 09:46",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5Tnfpwpjnu/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,3240,170,33,1,8,41
