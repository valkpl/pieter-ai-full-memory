I recently went on the Celibacy is SEXY! Show with Taja Hereford to explore the challenges of involuntary singleness and how single Christians can embrace their circumstances to enjoy belonging and purpose.

Toward the end of the episode, Taja asked me about paired companionship similar to the spiritual betrothals of the early Church and ""celibate partnerships.""

Back in January 2023, I wrote an article for Equip Insights where I cautioned against a common form of celibate partnerships, even calling experimentation with them sinful.

One of the biggest pieces of evidence I provided was that exclusive partnerships with an openness to romance seemed more similar to the spiritual betrothals of the early Church than spiritual friendships of David/Jonathan, Ruth/Namoi, etc.

Paul cautiously permitted these spiritual betrothals in 1 Cor 7 because there weren't better alternatives for celibate Christians at the time. But by the 4th century, monastic communities were readily available for celibate people, and spiritual betrothals were deemed unnecessarily risky by Church leaders.

In my article, I argued that celibate Christians today could easily join or start intentional Christian communities, so the same prohibition against spiritual betrothals / celibate partnerships applied. I even pointed to the Nashville Family of Brothers as proof that ""anyone can build it.""

But, I was too quick to dismiss celibate partnerships.

As I've hinted at in various posts, the Nashville Family of Brothers has been going through a challenging season. We continue to discern where the Lord is leading us. But it's abundantly clear that the ground is not fertile for communities like ours in this age of the Church.

The circumstances in which gay celibate Christians today are trying to find companionship to help them faithfully abstain from sex and use their availability for the sake of the kingdom is more similar to Paul's time and his cautious permission for spiritual betrothals.

Jesus enriches our concept of family, rejecting familial ties based solely on biology and instead establishing that Christian family is bound by the blood of Christ. 

That's good news for queer people, single moms, widows, those called to lifetime singleness to do kingdom work, singles who want to be married, lonely married people, people with complicated biological family, and people with no biological family.

I'm grateful for the honest convos about LGBT+ topics that I've gotten to have with fellow believers and Jesus-curious people across the globe in my comment sections and DMs.

My social media posts have always been about meeting people where they're at and addressing the genuine questions about faith, sexuality, and gender that their churches aren't answering.

That’s why I’d love to hear from you!

I’ve put together a quick survey (at link in bio) to learn from you about what conversations you'd like to have in 2025 and where you're stuck when it comes to LGBT+ topics and sexuality in general. 

It’ll take just 2 minutes, but your input will make a huge difference in what I post about this year.

Your feedback = more helpful conversations for people like you (and your friends!).

Your voice matters. Your needs matter. I’d be so grateful if you’d take a moment to share your thoughts.

I recently taught a Biblical Ethics Class at a Christian university, and during the Q&A time, a student asked me, ""What has the past decade of vocational singleness taught you about God?""

I'd never gotten this question before, but I was grateful for the push. After thinking a few moments, I replied...

""In college when I first started considering lifetime singleness, I had two big fears. I was afraid that singleness was drawing the short end of the stick. That I was missing out on the best things God had to offer.

And I was afraid that without a spouse or kids, my life would feel meaningless, thin, purposeless.

Most of all, I was afraid that this meant that I couldn't trust God to be good to me. To humanity, generally? Yes! To others? Sure. But to me? Not so much.

Yet, over the past decade God has surprised and reassured me.

He's invited me into the kingdom work of Equip, the Nashville Family of Brothers, being a mental health counselor, being a godfather, and doing public discipleship--and he's shown me that these paths of meaning and purpose were only possible because He called me to vocational singleness.

At the same time, He's brought me alongside nuclear families and helped me see in undeniable ways that their lives aren't better or easier (or worse or harder). The grass isn't greener on the other side. It may be a different pattern, but it's the same average color.

So, what has the past decade of vocational singleness taught me about God?

He is trustworthy, and He is good. Not only to everyone, but specifically to me :)""",99,"01/14/2025 08:45",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DE0CrabpQCV/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,2799,1621,146,11,7,25,2

If you think you might be called to the vocational singleness of Jesus and Paul, could I challenge you to move somewhere you could join a lifelong, lived-in intentional Christian community?

Or build it yourself!

Any of you—empowered by the Holy Spirit—could build the kind of Christian family you need. And you don't have to start big. 

Just find three other people willing to live in an apartment together and commit to celibacy for a year. Do some simple prayer together once a day, confess to each other once a week, do two meals together a week.

Maybe serve in your neighborhood together once a month, go on a vacation together, do one of the big holidays together, read a book about discernment or intentional Christian community together.

Celebrate kingdom work successes together and mourn loneliness together. You don’t have to do all of these.

Gather some people, do something for a year, and see what happens.

While I encourage you to seek out pastors or Christian leaders to help and support you, don't wait around for help.

Go build what you need.

P.S. What does this have to do with the gospel? Christian families (whether through marriage or intentional community) are meant to make God’s love tangible to those within a family and display God’s love to those outside the family.

I often use my birthday as a chance to dream about the upcoming year. In 2025, I'm hoping to bring everything back to the gospel.

If you've been following along for awhile, you've seen me post about LGBT+ topics, vocational singleness, intentional christian community, discernment, family for vocational singles, trans stuff, the idolatry of romance, sexual stewardship for all people, etc.

Those often dig into the finer details of each topics, so it's easy to miss the most important take-away: What does it have to do with the gospel?

If the articles and videos I get to contribute to have nothing to do with the gospel, then I'm wasting my time and your time.

At least for me, it's all about the gospel.

So in 2025, I want to go out of my way to remind myself (and practice in public) how this stuff is about the gospel.

For example, as a queer christian, I talk a lot about how christians can better love LGBT+ people according to historic sexual ethics.

The biggest reason Christians should care about LGBT+ topics? The gospel.

54% of LGBT+ people have left the Church. And straight non-believers say that LGBT+ topics is the #1 reason they're not following Jesus.

I'll be the first to argue that sexuality shouldn't have as much power/influence in our culture as it does. But it does.

LGBT+ topics has become a colossal wedge issue that the Enemy uses to push people toward deconversion. He tricks Christians into embodying God's wisdom in ugly ways. Then He carefully teaches Christians to be embarrassed of Christianity, and eventually, of Jesus.

For the sake of the kids and teens in our churches, we *have* to offer better answers about sexuality. And we *have* to get busy investing in real results for LGBT+ people in our local churches that demonstrates the goodness and beauty of God's wisdom.

In short, I care about how the Church talks about and treats LGBT+ people because I want to see more of my gay and straight friends in heaven.

It's all about in gospel.
