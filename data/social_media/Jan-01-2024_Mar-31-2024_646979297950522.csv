It's hard to believe it's already been 6 months since I made lifetime commitments to vocational singleness and the Nashville Family of Brothers.

Multiple people have asked, ""So, what's different?""

In most ways, not much.

But now I know who and where and what I'm committed to. When times get tough, I know that it's done. The commitments are made. There's a simple peace that comes from that. 

I don't have to worry anymore about whether making lifetime commitments is the right decision. Now, my job is to focus on making it work, making it worth it. My job is to be faithful to the commitments I've made.

Perhaps that's one thing that does feel different. I've been committed to celibacy and to kingdom work for years, but now those commitments feel weightier.

The pauses are longer and heavier when I'm tempted and pause to contemplate. Because I've not just committed to God, but also to my brothers, with my biological family and NFOB's Pastoral Advisory Board and friends as witnesses.

It's not been an easy 6 months, but I'm grateful for the fellowship and encouragement and iron-sharpening-iron that my brothers have offered me.

And for the simple things, like post-family dinner walks, followed by hot tea and reading in the living room.

Eventually, every conversation about gender ethics and God’s wisdom for trans people seems to get to the point where someone claims, “Well, it’s transition or suicide.” And often, the conversation stops.

This matters, because we know 41% of trans people attempt suicide, as compared to 1.6% of the general population.

Trans people were made in the image of God and God highly values them. Yet the brokenness of this world has cruelly convinced many trans people that they aren't worth loving and that their precious life isn't worth living.

Stats like that demand attention. They can’t be ignored.

But should is “transition or suicide” mantra true? Has transition been scientifically proven to reduce suicide risk?

Long story short: No. Available research is inconclusive about whether hormonal or surgical transition effectively reduce suicide risk.

Some scientific research demonstrated that use gender-affirming hormones or puberty blockers was associated with a lower risk of suicidal ideation.

Yet different analysis of the same data found that males going through hormonal transition were more likely to plan suicide, to attempt suicide, and to require hospitalization for a suicide attempt.

Similar analysis found that 16- and 17-year-olds who received hormones were more than twice as likely to report a past-year suicide attempt requiring inpatient hospitalization.

A similar story emerges for surgical transition.

Scientific studies have consistently found that surgical transition effectively reduces gender dysphoria and leads to high patient satisfaction, but they fail to reduce depression and suicidality. A longitudinal study of surgical transition in Denmark found that while 21.2% of participants experienced a reduction in suicidality after transition, 15.4% of participants experienced an increase in suicidality after transition.

Available research does not demonstrate that hormonal or surgical transition effectively reduce suicide risk.

Here’s the deal, just because I honor someone’s request doesn’t mean I’m theologically affirming their decisions. It just means that I don’t want terminology to be a barrier to getting to know a trans person.

And this whole conversation can be confusing because different people use different words to mean different things. For example, at Equip, the ministry I help run, we use the term ""gender incongruence"" to mean ""an acute sense that one’s gender does not correspond with the experience typically associated with the person’s biological sex"".

And then we use the term ""transgender/trans"" as ""a general term for someone who experiences gender incongruence"" without communicating anything about their theological convictions or the extent to which they have transitioned.

Why do names and pronouns matter so much to trans people? 

Well, for those who experience gender incongruence, their biological pronouns can be a constant reminder of the pain and tension they feel every day. Some experience meaningful relief from that tension when they adopt different pronouns.

Using alternate pronouns (similar to identifying as gay, bi, lesbian, etc.) can mean as little as “I experience gender incongruence” or as much as “I am fundamentally a transgender person and must follow a trans cultural script to be true to self” (and everything in between).

In conversation with a trans person using alternate pronouns or a different name, I default to language mirroring as hospitality. I mirror their language out of respect, particularly if they're not a believer or I don't know them well.

I’m not affirming.

I’m just avoiding unnecessary tension over language and keeping the door open for future conversation.

Now, if a trans Christian friend (with whom I have decades of friendship and mutually holding each other accountable) asks me to use alternate pronouns, I'll likely ask them what that means theologically for them and continue dialogue.",149,"03/13/2024 08:21",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4dYuSnppbX/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,3975,381,48,23,66,6

Classic personality tests like the Big Five OCEAN assessment identify a person’s level of agreeableness.

There are both constructive and destructive ways disagreeable people can show up in their families and workplaces.

For better and for worse, I'm a disagreeable person.

Life circumstances over the past year have increasingly forced me to face the fact that I'm a disagreeable person, take responsibility for the ways I've been destructively disagreeable, and grow in my habits of being constructively disagreeable.

Here's some typical traits of disagreeable people, including me:
1. Humble objection to something “wrong” (that can become combative/vindictive)
2. Careful directness (that can become harsh/harmful)
3. Wise risk-taking (that can become recklessness/narcissism)
4. Respectfully logical (that can become callous/insensitive)
5. Healthy doubt and skepticism toward people/institutions (that can become paranoia)
6. Modest self-interestedness (that can become selfishness/greed)

At the best of times, my disagreeability shows up as a willingness to say ""no"" when the crowd is saying ""yes"" to something inequitable, ineffective, inaccurate, or immoral.

At the worst of times, I can be a quarrelsome, overly suspicious, and conceited person who plays with fire and burns others—all in the name of logic.

Constructive disagreeableness has been essential to some of the most life-giving elements of my life. Equip (the LGBT+ ministry I started) and the Nashville Family of Brothers wouldn't exist without my disagreeableness.

I've been able to persevere as a gay Christian committed to historic sexual ethics (with repeated detractors on both sides), name what's not working for people like me, and push the Church to do better because of my disagreeableness.

But I've failed to keep my capacity for destructive disagreeableness in check. And it's catching up with me.

Paxton Barkdull recently had me on the Theology With Friends Podcast to talk about vocational singleness and LGBT+ topics, including how I arrived at a historic sexual ethic.

It’s been a journey!

I grew up hearing that every biblical Christian believed that God was against homosexuality.

I was taught that God’s wisdom in Scripture is self-evident to every Spirit-filled Christian and all come to the same conclusion.

Then I met smart Jesus-loving people in college with different interpretations. The simplicity of a self-evident Bible crumbled, disorienting my sexual ethics and my whole understanding of God’s wisdom.

I had a crisis of faith: How do I know God’s wisdom? *Can* I know God’s wisdom? Is God even real if so many disagree?

Serious doubt nearly destroyed my faith, but I dug deeper for better answers.

At the time, a friend quipped, “It’s either a pope in Rome, a pope in the mirror, or something in between. Choose your pope!”

I wasn’t Catholic, but I also didn’t trust my own interpretations over the next human’s. So I explored the in-between’s in Christian history.

As I studied, I was struck by Christ’s promise that He would give us the Church, led by His Apostles and their successors, to teach the Scriptures and lead His people.

And I was surprised to learn that a vast majority of Christians throughout history have believed that the most trustworthy human interpreters are those Church leaders who can trace their authority back to the Apostles.

To be clear, most Christians haven’t believed the Apostles (or their successors) teach perfectly. But if I personally arrive at a different interpretation than the strong consensus of the successors of the Apostles on a particular theological question, then I’m probably mistaken.

After that, the question of sexual ethics was fairly easy.

When I read the whole of Scripture with the historic Church, I found overwhelmingly more evidence for historic sexual ethics than for ex-gay theology or a revisionist sexual ethic.

I recently had the opportunity to dialogue with Reginaldo dos Santos Gomes, who interviewed me for Vivendo em Comunhão.

Living in Communion is a Brazilian initiative devoted to fostering Christian conversations on a variety of issues including sexuality, friendship, and hospitality.

Reginaldo asked me to share how I came to terms with my sexuality and settled into vocational singleness.

Many people (including Reginaldo) are surprised to hear that I dated women while being transparent about my sexuality, enjoyed romantic intimacy with them, and preferred to get married.

While I’m not bisexual and was fairly out in college, I was in a Christian fraternity and had to take women to date events.

A handful of times, both my date and I were surprised by how much we enjoyed the date and decided to go on more.

Two different times I fell in love while we dated, and at one point we nearly got engaged (but later broke up for reasons unrelated to my sexuality).

That's all to say, by the end of college, I knew that if God wanted me to marry a woman, that could work.

I'd also studied what the Scriptures had to say about lifetime abstinent singleness for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention. Both seemed like possibilities for me. 

Eventually, the Holy Spirit made clear to me that I wasn't supposed to go take whichever vocation I wanted, but instead I was supposed to ask God whether He had a preference for which gift He wanted to give me.

So in 2014 I started discerning my calling. And I actually went into that process preferring marriage and hoping God would call me to that.

But by 2017, I felt strongly that God was calling me to vocational singleness in the context of committed community and started focusing building what would become the Nashville Family of Brothers.

Here’s a snippet from a recent Equip Webinar I taught:

“Here’s six key ways pastors and parents can support those who are discerning:

1. Teach kids to anticipate discernment of both vocations
2. Model both vocations in your family by including celibates
3. Celebrate both vocations in your church with public vocational singleness commitments
4. Value both vocations by hiring people in both vocations as church leaders at all levels
5. Help teens grow their capacity for general discernment
6. Invite those in their 20s and 30s to discern and guide them in that process

Let’s explore each of those.

1. Teach kids to anticipate discernment

First, teach kids that one day they’ll get to discern between vocational singleness and Christian marriage.

From a young age, talk about the possibilities of both vocational singleness and Christian marriage for your kids. Talk about the fact that God knows which will be best for each of them, and build positive anticipation for a time when they’ll get to ask God which adventure He’ll call them on!

2. Model both vocations in your family

Second, model both vocational singleness and Christian marriage in your home by making sure to include people called to vocational singleness in the everyday life of your family.

Kids need to see both modeled as good and beautiful in your home to believe both could be good for them! You could be intentional about choosing vocational singles as godparents for your children to knit them into your family. You could invite single people to weekly dinner with your family or include them in holidays and vacations. You could even invite single people to live in your home, commit to your family, and help you raise your kids.”

Pastors will admit to me in private that they hesitate to teach and offer practical support for biblical singleness for the sake of the kingdom, because they’re afraid it’ll lead to even less Christian marriages.

I think they’re right to worry about Christian marriage trends, but I don’t think vocational singleness is the enemy.

A 2021 Pew Research Center report found that the share of American adults ages 25 to 54 who are married fell by almost 15 percentage points between 1990 and 2019, from 67 percent to 53 percent.

And the research found that that trend was mostly driven by people living without a spouse or partner.

In response to this, many pastors try to sell marriage as hard as they can and downplay vocational singleness.

G. K. Chesterton would warn them that that’s counterproductive.

He said, ""Whenever monks come back, marriages will come back.""

Chesterton lamented that too few Christians were committing to kingdom singleness, and too few Christians were faithfully walking out Christian marriage.

But he didn't see these vocations as competing in a zero-sum game. Instead, he suggested that robust teaching and practice of vocational singleness was the key to healthier Christian marriage.

So take Chesterton’s advice. Teach about both. Help Christians genuinely discern between both. Celebrate both. And provide practical support for both for a lifetime.",108,"02/21/2024 09:01",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3nf4s9ptGp/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,2835,159,21,15,34,1

Some claim that ""better to marry than to burn"" in 1 Corinthians 7:9 means that people who find abstinence challenging are automatically called to marriage.

That's a common misinterpretation that has particularly hurt mothers and children.

Pastors have used 1 Cor 7:9 to encourage people (particularly men) struggling with sexual purity to get married as a way to contain their sexual temptations.

But instead of fixing the problem, using ""marriage as a remedy for weakness"" just multiplies the number of people impacted by the lack of self-control, leading to infidelity, divorce, and destroyed lives.

To put it bluntly, if you continue to struggle mightily with sexual immorality after months of genuine effort, then you need sex addiction recovery, not marriage.

Every Christian, regardless of calling, can and must learn to discipline their sexual desires. Fiancés should not settle for less.

If ""marriage as a remedy for weakness"" wasn't Paul's intended message in 1 Cor 7:9, then what was?

Rigorous scholarship reveals that Paul was instead narrowly addressing a group of Corinthian Christians who had adopted strange Gnostic beliefs that their bodies didn't matter, so they were claiming to be ""celibate in spirit"" while engaging in unrestrained sexual immorality.

Paul was chastising people who claimed to be celibate but weren't earnestly trying to be celibate.

Regardless, we are right to read 1 Cor 7:9 as a caution against publicly committing to vocational singleness unless we have the gift from God to do it well.

But Jesus said the same about Christian marriage in Matthew 19:11: don't commit to Christian marriage unless you have the gift from God to do it well.

To thrive in either vocation, we must receive the gift from God to do that vocation well.

How do we figure out whether God wants to give us the gift of vocational singleness or Christian marriage? How do we put ourselves in a place where we can step into and receive that gift?

Recently, I was trying to explain my living situation to a non-Christian, and I stumbled upon a comical, somewhat effective description: I’m part of an ace-aro polycule.

I was searching for something that might translate for a non-Christian steeped in popular culture. “Ace-Aro” is shorthand for asexual and aromantic. And a “polycule” is a polyamorous grouping—a cluster of interconnected relationships that are intentionally non-exclusive.

There’s lot of ways these words **don’t** fit what we’re doing in the Nashville Family of Brothers. In contrast to those who often describe themselves as being in a polycule, we have committed not to engage in romantic or sexual activity with anyone.

Here’s what I actually said:
“I guess the short-ish version of my love life is that I'm part of what you could think of as an ace-aro polycule.
It's an intentional community with other guys also committed to celibacy and committed to serving those on the margins. Some of us are gay, some of us are straight. We live in a house together, do family dinners together, and spend vacations and holidays together. And this past fall I actually committed to family with these guys for the rest of my life!
I'm committing to love these men for the rest of my life, to never leave them, and to be buried next to them. I think God made me for that. But it'd totally make sense if you wondered ‘I mean, finding love and caring for people sounds great, but what does that have to do with celibacy?’
That's a fair question.
I know it's weird, but I believe in a God (although, admittedly, I doubt it sometimes). I trust that God and I trust His wisdom for me. I believe that God has called me to celibacy and that God intends for celibacy to be part of the package deal of this family I'm committing to. And the other guys in our family feel the same way.
I can't really explain it better other than to say that it's my strange family, I love them, and the more I've stepped toward family with them over the past 5 years, the happier I've felt, the move loved I've felt, the more integrated I've felt, and the more true-to-self I've felt.”",0,"02/12/2024 13:55",https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Q2Yp6RnF6/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,3702,258,18,30,43,1

I recently went on the Political Animals Podcast with Jonathan Cole to talk politics, faith, and sexuality. At one point, we explored why the double standard of sexual stewardship costs Christians' credibility inside and outside of churches.
Many churches lead straight Christians to assume that they will get married, teach that we need romantic companionship to be happy, and ignore the Bible’s teachings about vocational singleness and divorce.

But then these same churches call gay Christians to a higher standard of sexual stewardship by teaching that gay Christians don’t need romance or sex and challenging them to consider vocational singleness.

This inconsistent, hypocritical application of Scripture tempts sexual minorities to adopt a victim mentality and reject sexual morality standards because of the apparent double standard.

Churches lose credibility to ask gay Christians to live according to biblical wisdom when they refuse to hold straight Christians accountable to that same wisdom.

Yet this inconsistent standard hurts straight Christians as well.

Straight Christian marriages end in divorce at the same rate as non-Christian marriages, and unmarried straight Christians suffer from a lack of support in the church.

Instead, churches can invite everyone to steward their sexualities according to God’s good and weighty wisdom.

This might include examining whether straight Christians are...
- engaging in casual romance,
- having sex outside of marriage,
- making little or no progress on refraining from the use of pornography,
- failing to consider a call to vocational singleness,
- unthinkingly refusing an openness to raising children for the kingdom in marriage, or
- engaging in unbiblical divorce/remarriage.

Admittedly, these conversations about straight sexual stewardship are difficult to have, but they're not any heavier than conversations Christians seem eager to have about gay sexual stewardship...[con't in comments]",0,"02/08/2024 10:49",https://www.instagram.com/p/C3GN-xtRg3p/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,2959,264,33,12,63,6

A recent Harvard study showed that 36% of Americans experience extreme loneliness. According to the study, the Pandemic revealed that our social fabric is full of holes. People are falling through the cracks.

The study also found that a higher number of “friends” did not inherently reduce this loneliness.
Instead, if you dig into the study, researchers found that the key to health and happiness was having people in your life who are committed to living with you for the rest of your life.

We need lived-in community, and we need to know that we’ll have that community tomorrow, next month, next year, next decade, until we die.

It’s obvious how Christian marriage attempts to solve that problem. And still, plenty of married people struggle with loneliness.

But I want to particularly focus on single Christians. If the solution to loneliness is lived-in, lifelong human family, but we’re single for now and might be single for the rest of our lives, does that mean we’re just screwed. Does that mean we just have to accept loneliness?

No! Thankfully not. But it is true that what we’re doing isn’t working.

The revolving door of roommates and church small groups isn’t working. It just leads to heartbreak and weariness. Many just give up and resolve that it’s less painful to just be alone.

What is the solution? In the early Church, single Christians committed to a vocation of singleness for the sake of kingdom work for a lifetime. They lived with other vocational singles, as a family. They used their availability in singleness to serve the poor and needy together. And they stuck around in the same city, the same neighborhood, for their entire lives. And they weren’t lonely.

I recently went on the Church Politics Podcast with Justin Giboney of the AND Campaign to talk about faith and sexuality, including the recent controversy around Pastor Alistair Begg and whether Christians should attend gay weddings.

A grandmother asked respected evangelical leader Alistair Begg whether she should attend her grandchild's marriage to a queer person. He encouraged the grandmother to privately share her disagreement but still attend the wedding and even bring a gift.

In response, #ChristianTwitter #EvangelicalTwitter #ReformedTwitter canceled him.

So, should Christians attend gay weddings?

Christians can treat sacred what God treats sacred, be consistent, and maintain relationship.

God seems to have defined pretty narrowly what Christian marriage (the kind of marriage God uniquely joins and sustains) is: a lifetime union between one Christian woman and one Christian man with an openness to raising children for the sake of the kingdom.

Many civil unions fall short of that standard, including same-sex unions. If I'm invited to attend or participate in a wedding in some way, I need to ensure I'm testifying truthfully to who God is and what He is (or is not) doing.

Historically, attendees of Christian weddings participated in the ceremony liturgy by publicly affirming that God was indeed joining the couple in Christian marriage and committing to help the marriage thrive.

So it matters whether Christians attend weddings that claim to be joining a couple in a Christian marriage.

But there's a big difference between two non-Christians of the same sex getting married in a field without invoking God versus two self-professed Christians of the same sex quoting Scripture and using Christian marriage liturgy in a church.

I personally feel more comfortable attending some non-Christian same-sex weddings on that one extreme (in a field without naming God), whereas I'm much more careful if invited to weddings of two Christians of the same sex.

Here’s a snippet from a recent Equip Webinar I taught:

“Some people think God wants us to have no fun, that He wants us to show our love for Him by learning to be content with loneliness and dissatisfaction and to obsess about avoiding sin.

Some of us think that what we want is to have as much sex and romance with the most attractive people we can convince to be with us. Both of those are off. That’s not what God wants, and that’s not what we really want.

We want genuine connection. We want to not be lonely. We want community. We want love that lasts. We want richer, more meaningful, and steady relationships. We want to feel safe, to trust that the people who love us will love us well and keep doing so until we die. We want people to go on this life journey with who truly know us and therefore know how to accompany us well on that journey. And we want to offer the same to others and enjoy the delight that can only be achieved after decades of that knownness. And God wants those same things for us!

Our capacity for connection and need for community isn’t a test, it’s a gift. God made us in His image to enjoy intimacy with Him and each other, and He wants us to enjoy that to the fullest.”

1. Adopt a general posture of empathy and compassion - God made trans people in His image, and we must treat trans people with the dignity and respect every Imago Dei deserves.

2. Prioritize addressing mental health needs - Connect trans people with proven interventions to address depression/suicidality such as in-person talk therapy with a counselor to address grief/loss, regular exercise/physical activity, use of antidepressants, and a broader community of social support

3. Honor their lack of choice and explore options for morally neutral relief - Transgender people do not choose to experience gender incongruence. Help them resolve what they can and manage what they must.

4. Support their acceptance of some level of brokenness and suffering - Many trans Christians will continue to experience some persisting and painful gender incongruence, even after some social transition.

5. Address childhood shame from gender stereotypes - Many trans people were judged as kids when they liked or disliked something kids of their biological sex weren't supposed to. Help them identify shaming memories, create space to connect with any lingering painful emotions, name the falsity of cultural gender stereotypes, and honor the unique ways they express themselves, even when it’s contrary to cultural stereotypes.

6. Give permission to reject cultural gender stereotypes - While the core of a trans Christian's distress is an internal sense that one’s biological sex and felt gender are incongruent, feeling forced to comply with arbitrary cultural expectations can multiply distress.

Parents and pastors can join trans Christians by resisting historical over-prescription of what universal, Biblical masculinity and femininity are, while maintaining a God-ordained distinction between the biological sexes and genders.

7. Encourage them to share their stories and gather together - Trans Christians need to share about their experiences to be fully known and fully loved, and our churches need to hear the stories of trans Christians who are faithfully stewarding their brokenness.",284,"01/25/2024 09:48",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2iDX8_Jccc/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,2566,121,7,7,47,

I'm a January birthday boy, so the turn of the year back-to-back with a birthday gives me plenty of time to reflect and look forward. I hope this year includes...

1. Effectively equipping Uri Denivelle to take Equip's strategy and solutions back to Europe to help churches there offer Christ's love and wisdom to LGBT+ people

2. Leaning into tough conversations about the higher standards public Christian leaders are held to and my need to learn how to imitate Jesus by turning the cheek

3. Teaching classes at my local Anglican Church on sexual stewardship and getting ordained as a deacon in the ACNA so I can better minister/teach around celibacy and sexuality

4. Seeing growth in the health of the Nashville Family of Brothers and the sweetness of the experience of family we share

5. Securing a book deal with a Christian publisher to get out the message about discerning vocational singleness and Christian marriage

6. Serving counseling clients in private practice to help them honor their pain, connect more authentically, and grow in mental and spiritual health

18069584074460928,17841415038692451,pieterlvalk,"Pieter L Valk, LPC","Why do many Christians find historic sexual ethics unconvincing?

I recently went on the Canadian Church Leaders Podcast to talk with Chris Price about how churches can better offer Christ's love and wisdom to LGBT+ people.

At one point, we explored why historic sexual ethics don't seem to be convincing for many modern Christians.

I've said before that I'm confident that historic sexual ethics stand up to intellectual probing and questioning. By my assessment, the evidence for revisionist sexual ethics pales in comparison.

But arguments about sexual ethics are often unconvincing and unhelpful. Why?

At times, the arguments for historic sexual ethics feel irrelevant when faced by affirming arguments that historic sexual ethics bear bad and ugly fruit.

People have an (accurate) sense that if something is true, it should also be good and beautiful. There may be better intellectual arguments for historic sexual ethics, but if the fruit isn't good or beautiful, then isn't something off?

They're right.

Something is off.

But I don't think it's because historic sexual ethics are false. Instead, I think it's because the Church has failed to embody God's wisdom in the way Jesus would.

So instead of stumbling into emotionally-loaded arguments about sexual ethics, what if proponents of historic sexual ethics admitted that something is off?

What if instead of arguing, we got busy transforming our churches into places that actually embody historic sexual ethics in ways that lead to belonging and thriving for LGBT+ Christians?

What if we spent our energies preventing the wounds of the closet, raising the bar for everyone's sexual stewardship, and offering lifelong lived-in family to singles regardless of sexual orientation?

And in the meantime, what if we were quick to admit what's ""off"" and confessed the sins of the Church against LGBT+ people over the past century?

I might push back for two reasons:
First, because it's misguided. 
Research has shown that pray-the-gay-away theology doubles the risk of suicide and doesn't lead to meaningful sexual orientation change, so yes, let's reject that, but research has shown following a compassionate historic sexual ethic to lead to normal healthy levels of mental health in gay Christians and higher than average life satisfaction.

Whereas a lot of the gay Christians I know who've moved to a revisionist sexual ethic don't call themselves Christians anymore after 3-5 years, for a variety of reasons that I've discussed before.

It seems like if we're looking for the best solution for gay Christians, it's not pray-the-gay-away theology or a revisionist sexual ethic

The second reason it's problematic is that it makes it a lot harder for people like me when you adopt a revisionist sexual ethic. When I'm struggling with sexual temptations or tempted to abandon a historic sexual ethic, I need my straight Christians friends to be strong for me to reassure me that God's wisdom is true and to give me the strength to press on. If instead my straight friends have already moved to a revisionist sexual ethic even thought it costs them much less and they respond to my struggles by saying, ""well, maybe you should just abandon historic sexual ethics. I have."" It's not loving or helpful, it's disorienting, it piles onto my doubt, it's crushing.
 
So, if you want God's very best for the gay people you love, I urger you not to fall into the trap of conflating a historic sexual ethic with pray-the-gay away theology, or grab for a revisionist sexual ethic that might end up being just as destructive in the lives of the gay people you love. Instead, hold fast to the middle way that leads to mental health and thrive.

Then get involved in the work of making our churches places where LGBT+ people can belong and thrive according to a historic sexual ethic it's possible! The reason why we don't see it now is that few churches have actually tried it.

A bit confusing, at least for some, right?

A couple of weeks ago, he gave priests the freedom to informally bless people in same-sex unions. Then this surrogacy announcement seems like a pivot the other direction.

Conservative Protestant Christians are confused by both. They're alarmed the Pope is being too progressive on legal gay marriage, and they're confused why surrogacy is even a theological question.

Here's the problem: most of us Protestants have a fairly shallow theology of sexuality.

A lot of us believe in ""save sex for marriage"" (and then sprinkle in a little clarification that marriage is only between a man and a woman). But then we believe everything else is fair game.

We use God or the Bible as a litmus test for a couple of cultural questions. We use God or the Bible against people we disagree with, when it's convenient for us.

But most Protestants aren't actually interested in letting the God of the Bible inform how we think about all of our sexuality and all of the ways we engage our mind, body, and spirit in relationships of all kinds.

We don't want to think about the biblical morality of divorce/remarriage, contraception, plastic surgery, surrogacy, IVF, casual romance outside of marriage, or celibacy.

So when Catholics like the Pope slide into our feeds with seemingly random takes about all kinds of questions of sexuality, we're confused...[con't in comments]",223,"01/10/2024 07:22",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C17LF5rryLE/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,4946,229,22,34,47,3

I had a birthday post typed up sharing my hopes for my next year of life focusing on Equip, my discernment book project, ordination in the ACNA, etc.

Then I experienced a devastating loss in my life.

The time isn't right to share more details, but I can say that I've not experienced this much pain or fear in more than five years. I'm cycling between numbness and crying in the grocery store and screaming into my pillow.

Suffice to say, a hopeful birthday post doesn't fit anymore.

Instead, I find myself wanting to ask God for a miracle. But terrified to ask. Because I'm afraid to be rejected.

For many of us, that's normal in our human relationships, right? We want to take a risk and ask people in our lives to care for us in deeper ways, but we're afraid to put ourselves out there and be rejected.

Not only will we continue to not have what we feel like we need (if we're rejected), but then there's a new, additional pain of knowing someone you want to rely on told you, ""No.""

I don't know who else feels this in your relationship with God, but I certainly do.

Faced with a devastating loss in my life, I want to ask God for a miracle, but I'm afraid to.

I've made mistakes, others have made mistakes. None of us deserve for God to step in and make things better.

But this loss seems so far from the beautiful vision God usually has for the world, and God stepping into this particular situation to repair what humans have broken seems right up His alley.

So on my 33rd birthday, I'm feebly asking God for a miracle.

And I'm afraid to ask.

This year Equip trained over 7500 Christian leaders, including pastors at a 15K attendance megachurch and a 175-church network that serves 500K Christians.

Plus, we developed a first-of-its-kind resource for parents and pastors who want to offer God's love and wisdom to trans people and those navigating gender incongruence.

Thank you to Lipscomb University's College of Bible & Ministry for the opportunity to teach a dozen class periods as a recurring lecturer on vocational singleness and LGBT+ topics.

I was dazzled by a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the Galapagos after teaching 500 Ecuadorian Christians students for a week.

I'm grateful that my sabbatical showed me how I've used workaholism to avoid fear and sadness, helped me focus on making NFOB ""work"" for all of us, and taught me patience around public discipleship projects (even as my audience passed the 20K mark).

I was richly blessed to make lifetime commitments to vocational singleness and to the Nashville Family of Brothers. God provided me with the full gift of singleness and covenanted me with NFOB. 

Then I got to celebrate my commitments in Europe with brothers and friends, complete with windmills, vineyards, hot air balloon rides, and making a pilgrimage to the grave of my favorite author.

I was humbled to continue journeying with my counseling clients and delighted to see the ways they're honoring their pain, connecting more authentically, and growing in mental and spiritual health.

I lost both of my grandmothers in 2023, a friend committed suicide, I weathered numerous painful disappointments, and I faced scary moments when it felt like beautiful things I've been helping build for years might collapse.

I made plenty of mistakes at work and in my personal life, I continued to struggle with lust, and I was challenged in healthy ways to reckon with the higher standard Christian leaders are called to.

And through all of it, God seemed to provide just enough tenderness, patience, and care through my brothers and sisters in Christ.
