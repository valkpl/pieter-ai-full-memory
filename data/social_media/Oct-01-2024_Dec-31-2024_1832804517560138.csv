I recently shared about my ongoing sexual addiction recovery. And I’ve posted in the past about the fact that same-sex attraction does not inherently lead to sexual addiction.

But it’s true that gay people struggle with sexual addiction at higher rates than some other populations. Why?

The closet.

Even into the 2020s, surveys continue to find that the average LGBT+ person waits five years after noticing same-sex attractions or gender incongruence to share with a parent or a pastor.

Teens are still afraid that if/when they share their story, they’ll be called an abomination, told they’re dirty and disgusting, bullied, or kicked out of their house or church.

They spend five years making sense of big questions around identity and self-worth without the love and wisdom of parents, left alone in the dark with the lies of the Enemy and the broken world around us.

For many this leads to loneliness, shame, anxiety, depression, suicidality, and doubt about whether God loves us or even exists.

The closet is a breeding ground for addiction. It was for me.

We drowned in pain, and we were desperate for something to help us numb and escape. 

We were afraid that if we got too close to friends, we’d develop a crush or accidentally out ourselves, so we settled for shallow friendship.

For many trapped in the closet, lust and pornography seemed like the only way to escape pain and connect with something. That perfect storm taught too many of us to repeatedly medicate our pain with something sexual.

Then like any addiction, as our pain continued, our addiction grew. Porn was no longer good enough. We needed a bigger dose of something more.

To be clear, I’m not trying to absolve myself or anyone else of responsibility for our decisions. Regardless of addiction, I’m responsible for my actions and for my recovery.

But consider this: how would you view a straight person who secretly experienced five years of repeated trauma in their teens, developed an addiction to pain-killers, and are still struggling with imperfect recovery into adulthood?

How are gay people like me much different?

Over Thanksgiving my brother and sister-in-law forced me to watch The Golden Bachelorette with them. And I cried.

At the end of episode 4 of Joan's season, multiple contestants failed to get a rose. But instead of being sore losers toward the other eligible elderly bachelors or pining over Joan, they gushed over their newfound brothers.

Fan-favorite Charles L. said, ""We opened our hearts. Everybody helped each other. [We made] lots of good friends,"" as he excitedly hugs another contestant goodbye.

Later he shares, ""It's [been] a successful journey for me, having love with my friends. It's a different form of love. [But] I did find it.""

Despite the fact that the whole Bachelor/Bachelorette franchise is built on an idolization of romance, these men shared a house together for a month or so and discovered that friendship love was what they had been searching for all along.

Age has given them wisdom. Wisdom enough to notice when brotherhood is just as satisfying as (if not more satisfying than) romantic love of another.

They might as well have been quoting David in 2 Samuel 1:26

""I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been a close friend to me. Your love for me was more wonderful Than the love of women.""

What if we didn't wait until our 60s to discover that friendship love could be just as satisfying as romantic love?

What if we were no longer bachelors, because we'd settled into a family of friends?

I just finished a seminar with a team of pastors just outside of New York City. We were exploring some of the trickiest questions that come up in 1-on-1 discipleship with straight Christian allies of LGBT+ people or LGBT+ Christians seeking to be faithful to God's wisdom. 

People often ask: ""Wasn't Jesus silent on sexuality? Should churches just be silent where Jesus was silent?""

How would you respond?

During our seminar, we discovered that in Matthew chapter 19, Jesus actually addresses sexuality directly and gives us everything we need to know for sexual stewardship in 12 verses.

Jesus calls His people back to God’s original intentions for marriage: a lifelong marriage between one woman and one man to serve God, not themselves.

And then Jesus introduces an alternative: permanently giving up romance, marriage, sex, and biological children for the sake of doing kingdom work with undivided attention.

Those are Christ’s best for us: christian marriage or vocational singleness, regardless of sexual orientation.

That’s what a vast majority of Christians have believed over the past 2,000 years, and that’s what the majority of global Christians believe today.

So Jesus did have something to say about sexuality in the Scriptures. His wisdom is pretty clear, and we can trust it.

I'm curious, are the Christian leaders in your community eager to get equipped for LGBT+ discipleship?

Vocational singleness is often misunderstood and misrepresented in art and culture as a solitary, extreme, or overly mystical vocation.

Renaissance-era paintings like “The Monk by The Sea” portray a constant drama of temptations and holier-than-thou isolation. Others depict desert monks and cave ascetics battling with demons.

Let’s face it: Christians have an ascetic fetish.

We’ve romanticized celibacy in a way that makes it easy to dream about and just as easy to dismiss.

Christians have fetishized vocational singleness as a lofty and inaccessible sacrifice to be thrilled by, rather than something to seriously consider for ourselves.

But Early Church sources about the practice of singleness tell a different story than the popular paintings:

Men and women (1) permanently committed to celibacy, (2) gathered in informal urban communities,  (3) working normal jobs,  (4) going to church with married Christians and their kids, and (5) using their availability to serve the poor and needy.

Far from isolated ascetics, they formed supportive, intentional communities that reflected Christ’s kingdom.

Part of my discernment of vocational singleness—a lifetime commitment to celibacy for the sake of undivided Kingdom work––included a wrestling with these unbiblical, romanticized ideas of celibacy.

Thankfully, study of the Scriptures and the wisdom of the Early Church helped me recognize my need for lifelong, lived-in family––eventually leading to the founding of the Nashville Family of Brothers.

We’re an ecumenically Christian community offering lifelong family to men called to vocational singleness. It’s our home where we pray, eat, work, and worship together while remaining active in our local churches and broader community.

What if God wasn’t calling you to lonely prayer in a cave, but instead robust lived-in family with other celibates that you could depend on for a lifetime?

How might rejecting the ascetic fetish of past centuries and renewing your vision for vocational singleness help you discern more clearly?

First, develop your capacity for general Christian discernment. Get experience with the general practice of bringing a question to God.

Second, remove any theological or psychological barriers that might bias you against either by meeting with a therapist and studying Scripture.

Third, consider whether you feel called to the kingdom work of raising children, kingdom work mutually exclusive with raising children, or don't feel a strong calling to either.

Fourth, examine past and current circumstances to see if they point to God leading you down one path or another.

Fifth, get a spiritual director to guide your discernment process and ask family to pray and process with you.

92% of LGBT+ people said their return wouldn’t depend on a church changing its theology

Both public opinion and research on LGBT+ attitudes toward the Church suggest that Christians don't have to change our beliefs on trans topics for people to choose Jesus.

We just need to share and embody those beliefs in ways that reflect the love of Jesus and lead to genuine thriving for trans people.

We can extend compassion and community to trans people while holding fast to a biblical gender ethic.

As conversation about trans topics heats up (including recent Supreme Court oral arguments of its first major trans case), what should Christians say about Christ's love and wisdom for trans people?

Instead of saying this...

""Being trans is fake. Or a mental illness. Trans people are predators trying to trick kids into being trans and/or get in restrooms around vulnerable females. Medical transition is a liberal agenda to abuse children and mutilate their genitals. Boys should like the color blue, trucks, and football. Girls should like the color pink, barbies, and ballet. It's as simple as that.""

SAY THIS...

""I believe those who report feeling painful gender incongruence and alienation from their own bodies. I reject baseless allegations that all trans people are predators and dismissive assertions that they’re mentally ill. And while I affirm that God did not intend for anyone to experience gender incongruence, I also affirm that it isn't their fault.

God isn't surprised, and God loves trans people deeply. He made them in his image, died for their salvation, and wants them to follow His wisdom so they can experience fullness of life in him.

God also has a role here for the church. Christians with gender incongruence should not have to hide their experience from siblings in the faith. Our churches must be places where trans people find community in the body of Christ. They should find support to resist the temptation of using hormones or surgery—support that includes pushing back on harmful and reductive gender stereotypes that come from our culture, not the Bible.""

""Americans have already heard from the extremes: Non-Christians have heard prominent Christians say that being trans is either fake or a mental illness, something to be debunked, condemned, and stigmatized.

On the other extreme, trans advocates chant 'transition or suicide', even for minors, despite consistent research summarized in the Cass Review revealing that medical transition has not been demonstrated to reliably reduce depression or suicidality.

Believers can and must push back against both transphobia and the idol of self-invention. We must answer our neighbors’ genuine cultural and ethical questions in ways that are biblically robust, intellectually satisfying, and aligned with scientific evidence.

But I've got a lot of friends who disagree with biblical sexual ethics or aren't Christians at all anymore.

1. Teach what Jesus and Paul actually said about a lifetime calling to celibate singleness for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention.

2. Value vocational singleness in your church. Hire single people as head ministers, preaching pastors and worship leaders. Make single people visible to the whole congregation. 

3. Celebrate the commitments of vocational singles and their kingdom work as much as weddings and children. Married people are honored at every step from engagement to baptisms. Let’s honor the milestones of singles.

4. Guide young adults to open-handedly discern between vocational singleness and Christian marriage. Help the next generation ask God which gift He wants to give, and help them receive God’s gift with joy.

5. Help vocational singles build lifelong, lived-in human family. Gather singles in your church, help them cast vision for intentional Christian community, and coach them as they build the family they need.

Myth #1 - Romance will fulfill you.

Many have come to believe that romantic relationship is the key to fulfillment. But idolizing romance creates unrealistic expectations that a partner will satisfy all our deepest needs, leading to disappointment and heartache.

Deeper and healthier fulfillment comes from cultivating our relationship with God, intimate friendships, and yes, romantic relationships if we’re called to Christian marriage.

Myth #2 - Marriage is the ultimate goal.

While you may have been taught that in order to become a fully-adult Christian you have to get married, marriage is just one meaningful life path. 

Christians can broaden the possibilities they teach the kids in their churches by modeling and building healthy anticipation for both vocational singleness and Christian marriage.

Myth #3 - You can’t be truly happy without a romantic partner.

Romcoms and fairytales lead us to believe that romantic love is the ultimate source of happiness. Unfortunately, this mindset overlooks the rich, fulfilling lives of single people.

True joy comes from God. If you lean into depending less on romance, you might experience freedom to form deeper, intentional bonds with greater community. 

Myth #4 - Marriage and God are all you need for intimacy.

While a relationship with God and a spouse are important, even healthy marriages need friendships and community.

Intimacy is multifaceted, and Scripture shows us that God’s followers thrived in community wider than a nuclear family.

Myth #5 - Singleness is second-best.

Singleness is often viewed as a temporary stage or a fallback option. However, God designed vocational singleness to be a lifelong, first-choice calling for some with kingdom purpose.

God’s intention is for vocational singles to enjoy just as much lifelong, lived-in family as marrieds.

Maybe you or your church has bought into these myths—

Someone asks me that question almost every time I do a Q&A at a church. The short answer is ""no""

There isn't any scientific evidence to suggest that sexual abuse makes people gay.

A lot of the sexual abuse survivors I know who are also gay Christians can't seem to shake that question.

They seem to struggle deeply with asking themselves:

""Would I still be gay if I hadn't been abused? Were my same-sex attractions preventable?""

Painfully, this leads to victim-blaming for a lot of those folks. They beat themselves up for not doing more to stop the abuse, because maybe it would have also prevented them from being gay.

I've noticed these survivors seem to see their same-sex attractions as more tragic and feel like they’re more fundamentally doomed to a life of misery.

Maybe another way of putting it is that my gay friends who aren't abuse survivors seem to have an easier time believing that they still have a chance at a good life.

But survivors often believe that they're hopelessly cursed.

If you're gay, Christian, and an abuse survivor who is burdened with these questions, first, let me say how common your curiosities are in light of the tragedy you've endured.

It wasn't your fault, no matter how much you resisted.

And still, without really being able to know what would be different if your community had properly protected you from your abuser, it makes sense that it's hard to shake the fear that all of this could have been prevented and now you're doomed in some way.

But could I invite you to try on the idea that there's no evidence that sexual abuse causes same-sex attractions because, well, they don't.

Just imagine for me for a second, if you knew with certainty, that even if you hadn't been abused, you'd still be gay today, does anything shift for you?

If you knew that were true, without a doubt, would it feel easier to hope and invest in that hope?

Forrest, you're one of the most resilient and dependable people I know. As I've told you many times, among the people I know, I think you've endured some of the most difficult circumstances, and yet you continue to serve the Lord and love people deeply.

Even though you're sorely underpaid, you continue in full-time ministry sharing the gospel every day. With little help from extended family, you've single-handedly helped your parents transition from independent-living.

You always strive to give people the benefit of the doubt and understand them and believe the best in people. You're caring and attentive, particularly to make sure no one is hurt or left out.

I can always depend on you to be patient and thoughtful :)

LGBT+ people in the Church feel the weight of this first, but the truth is, romance idolatry is hurting everyone. Many churches push romance as the cure for loneliness, leaving gay celibate Christians particularly empty-handed.
 
But here’s the good news for you: if we’re all struggling with this same challenge, we can all share in the solution.

What if, instead of making romance, marriage, or sex the answer, your church became a place where you could find real belonging and companionship—no matter your relationship status?

What if you could experience intentional Christian community, where you can build a family that isn’t based on marriage, but on Christ?

My own experience has been that no matter how skinny I get or how much muscle I put on or how perfect my haircut is—no matter what changes about my appearance, it's never been enough.

I experience the same loneliness, not-enough-ness, and shame. Anecdotally, the same has been true for the gay men and straight women in my life who've shared with me about their body shame.

Why? No amount of beauty can protect us from loneliness.
 
Take a closer look at some common lies:

""If you looked like the perfect-looking guys in pornography, you'd be loved. You wouldn't feel alone. You're lonely because you don't look like the guys in videos. It's your fault. You have no one to blame but yourself.""
 
Do you notice how that the core need at play isn't to be handsome or beautiful? Or even desired?

It's to not be alone.

It's to be connected in healthy ways and believe we are enough. We can't kick body shame by working out or dieting more because those aren't addressing the real problem. It's a lie, a false solution, that keeps us running on a hamster wheel.

It’s natural to feel shaken when respected theologians revise long-held positions, especially on sensitive issues like sexuality. Questions about our convictions can easily creep up.

After all, if someone who seems so knowledgeable and faithful like Dr. Richard B. Hays has reconsidered, doesn’t that cast doubt on what you’ve believed?

Feeling unsettled is reasonable. Hays has been widely respected, especially for his work in The Moral Vision of the New Testament, which shaped many Christians’ understanding of biblical ethics.

So, when someone of his stature changes their view on same-sex marriage, it might seem like a sign that you’re missing something important.

But Hays’s change of heart doesn’t have to scare you. In fact, it’s worth noting that there’s no groundbreaking new evidence supporting his shift—just the same old “trajectory” argument, which has been thoroughly refuted before.

Preston Sprinkle’s recent review of Hays’s book confirms the concerns I raised months ago: this isn’t a fresh or convincing case, but rather another theologian switching sides without offering new, compelling reasons.

Instead of abandoning God's wisdom, what if we focused on embodying it in ways that lead to true flourishing? While critics argue that God's wisdom leads to suffering for gay people, research actually shows that gay celibate Christians committed to historic sexual ethics score in the normal range of mental health compared to the average American while holding onto their faith (often in contrast to their peers who abandon historic sexual ethics). 

What if the Church came alongside these believers to help them get from average health to thriving?! Let's learn from this and explore how the Church can support all believers in living out His truth in ways that lead to deep connection and fullness of life.

I recently got to write a week of lectionary devotionals for The Living Church. Check out my Thursday devotional on Luke 10: 17-24:

“Instead of rejoicing in our power (because whatever power we have, it is not truly ours), Jesus encourages His followers to rejoice in their redemption and in God's mercy. Christ models this by humbling Himself before God the Father, recognizing His position and rejoicing in His sonship.

To be clear, when Jesus notes that the Father has ‘hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and [has] revealed them to infants,’ He's not promoting anti-intellectualism. Instead, He's reassuring those who are poor and needy for whom the brokenness of this world feels particularly burdensome.

Unlike how this broken world works–where those who are most important, most educated, most wealthy, and most powerful are preferred by kings and by the gods of other religions–our God actually prefers the poor and needy. 

He prefers those who are willing to humble themselves before God and approach as a child. Children have nothing to brag about. They are (hopefully) eager to learn and grateful for whatever they are given. Children are aware of their lack of power and inability to care for themselves. They're aware that they can't know or do everything.

How could you bring your neediness to the Lord today?
What practical steps could you take to put yourself in a position to receive from the Lord?”

I just went on the Premature Adults Podcast with Arthur Mensah to explore identity development at the intersection of sexuality and faith in our current cultural moment. 

When I first came out publicly, I finally had the freedom to fully lean into “being gay”. Part of me hoped that leaning in could help me figure out who I was.

For a season, I painted my nails, wore crop tops, and used rainbows everywhere I could. I listened to Troye Sivan while driving to drag brunch. It affected how I talked and what I talked about.

It was genuinely fun to try on these stereotypically gay cultural elements. But after a while, it was obvious that some of these elements didn’t fit for me. I eventually held on to the things that were authentic for me, and let go of the rest.

I’ve noticed this same pattern among friends. While people were trapped in the closet, they didn’t have the freedom to figure out who they were or what they liked. And they were lonely.

So when they came out, they were desperate for belonging and self-discovery. Many thought that the easiest way to find friends was to quickly adopt all of the gay cultural stereotypes (and let others tell them who they ought to be so they could belong).

To be clear, I’m not judging anyone. Belonging is desirable, particularly for people who’ve been tortured in the closet, alone.

Yet I find it curious that while younger generations are particularly allergic to their church or parents offering them a curated identity to try on, younger people are increasingly identifying as LGBTQ+ and grasping for the curated identity offered there.

Perhaps the responsibility of self-invention is attractive in theory, but in practice it’s too great a burden for any teenager or young adult to bear. Maybe we all need help from our community to discover the identity God has already imagined for us.

Maybe we ought to be honest with ourselves that we’re going to let others tell us who we ought to be. Maybe the real question is whether we’ll invite Jesus to show us who we truly are, or (inadvertently) give that power to someone else

Churches have typically been silent about Christ's love and wisdom for gay people until after a teen comes out, enabling the trauma of the closet. 

Kids haven’t known whether their parents or pastors are safe to share with, so they chose to go into the proverbial closet and make sense of their sexuality without the love and wisdom of parents, left alone with the lies of the Enemy and culture. 
They were tortured in the closet and accrued closet wounds like loneliness, anxiety, shame, depression, sexual sin, addiction, abandoning God’s wisdom, suicidality, and loss of faith. By the time they came out, most had already abandoned historic sexual ethics or a belief in God altogether, and it was too late.
