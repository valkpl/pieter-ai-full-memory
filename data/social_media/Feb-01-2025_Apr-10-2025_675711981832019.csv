Many people (gay and straight) feel stuck in a singleness they did not choose.

What if you owned your celibacy and found a way to thrive in it, even if it wasn’t your first choice?

Embracing your singleness is a process:

1. Mourn Your Losses - Acknowledge and grieve anything you feel like you might lose by accepting celibacy, including hopes for marriage. Share your feelings with God, seek support from a therapist or empathetic community, and address unresolved grief to move forward.

2. Develop Discernment skills - Learn to discern God’s will by engaging in prayer, reflecting on Scripture, consulting spiritual mentors, and taking small steps toward decisions. Be patient, seeking input from trusted friends and faith communities.

3. Deepen Your Understanding of Christian Vocations - Study the biblical and historical teachings on vocational singleness and marriage. Recognize both as equally challenging and rewarding paths for building God’s kingdom and bringing life to others.

4. Identify Your Kingdom Work - Explore how your availability in singleness can uniquely serve God’s purposes. Consider how your gifts can bring healing, justice, and wholeness to others, and seek purpose in your calling.

…and finally and most importantly…

5. Find or Build Family: Pursue stable, lifelong relationships that reflect God’s love. Whether through biological family, church communities, or intentional Christian groups, prioritize creating a supportive, permanent family environment.

This road can feel long, so it’s okay to make incremental commitments.

Start with short-term commitments to vocational singleness to provide clarity and freedom. 

Then, when you feel ready, consider making a public lifetime commitment, celebrating the value and joy of your vocation.

Many Christians today are eager to pursue biblical justice—standing against racial inequality and advocating for female leadership. But when it comes to sexuality, that same passion for justice often feels at odds with historic Christian sexual ethics.

Is it possible to believe in social justice and still uphold a historic Christian sexual ethic?

In Equip’s next monthly webinar, we’ll wrestle with that tension head-on.

We’ll explore:
- what’s transferable between biblical racial justice and God’s best for LGBT+ people?
- how barriers to queer thriving according to God’s wisdom are sometime systemic
- steps church can take to make LGBT+ whole and make historic sex ethics more accessible

Stephen Adubato and I have been cross-blogging on our respective Substacks/platforms. I was honored to write a piece for his spaces exploring the seemingly parallel yet contradictory trends of a new ex-gay movement (under the name of reintegrative therapy) and increased pansexual identification among GenZers. DM/comment “ex-gay pansexual” for the link.

Now it’s Stephen’s turn. And he has not disappointed.

In “​​From Drag to Dimes Square: The Return of the Homofascist”, Adubato explores the strange historical correlation between gay men and fascism.

Conditioned by the closet to see the world as an unapologetic contest of power (one which they lost for most of their younger years), gay men channel a keen eye for social dynamics—developed in the closet for self-preservation—into a potent force for cultural domination.

In response to homophobia often packaged as accusations of efficacy, gay men are drawn to hypermasculinity.

Oddly, fascist movements that telegraph anti-LGBT messages nonetheless attract gay men who’ve become infatuation with domination, hypermasculinity, and a desire to belong.

Adubato’s piece explores the roots of this relationship deeper, the inadequate responses of Christians, and an invitation for Christian leaders to offer disillusioned gay men something better.

What if we built a Church where same-sex attracted men never had to go into the closet in the first place? Were never tortured by homophobia? Were valued, invited on a mission to make the world right alongside Jesus, and found belonging among their siblings in Christ?

Recently, I preached two chapel messages at Asbury Theological Seminary. This second message focused on building community through friendship. 

Many of the mothers and fathers of our faith depended on what's called ""spiritual friendship"" to sustain their ministry: David and Jonathan, Ruth and Naomi, Jesus and John, and Paul and Timothy. 

I'm particularly struck by Ruth's words: ""Your people will be my people and your God my God."" 

It reminds me of romantic sayings like ""I am YOURS and you are mine."" We think of that sentiment as being reserved for something sexual. 

But Ruth here, and all of these spiritual friends, are reminding us that we are made for friendships where we can also say ""I am YOURS."" 

Not in a way that competes with a spouse, if we have one, or competes with our relationship with Jesus. But one that builds up both.

So don't be afraid of making friends who say ""I am YOURS."" 

It might be exactly what your loneliness and your relationship with Jesus needs!

And if you don’t believe me, your loneliness might be proof.

I recently led a seminar with the Boston Fellows focused on friendship as the solution to loneliness, regardless of whether you're single or marriage.

The problem: too many married people stop investing in friendships once they say “I do.” Too many single people assume they don’t belong in family life. Both are wrong.

If you only build friendships with people who share your life stage, you’re missing out on so much of what God designed community to be.

Married people—you need single friends who will remind you that your identity isn’t just “husband” or “wife” or “parent.” Friends who call you into deeper mission beyond just your nuclear family.

Single people—you need married friends who invite you into their homes, their chaos, their rhythms. Not just as an occasional guest, but as family.

The Church was never meant to be split into “singles” and “marrieds.” We were meant to do life together. So what would it look like to push against the trend?

Married people: Text a single friend and invite them into your real life—not just for special occasions.

Single people: Stop waiting to be included. Show up. Offer to help. Make yourself part of the family.

Let’s stop doing life in silos. The friendships you’re missing might be the ones that change everything.

Recently, I preached two chapel messages at Asbury Theological Seminary. The first focused on this common experience.

A lot of us grew up believing that marriage is one of the best gifts God gives His people. And it is a beautiful calling!

But sometimes, that expectation turns into entitlement—leaving us frustrated, even resentful, when marriage doesn’t happen as soon as we’d like.

But what if the solution isn’t just waiting longer? What if the answer is discernment?

What if God actually wants to show you—clearly—whether you’re called to Christian marriage or to vocational singleness?

What if He wants to give you a deeper peace about the future right now, instead of leaving you guessing?

Churches have historically
pushed queer people into pray-the-gay-away ministries,
enabled a double standard for gay vs. straight sexl ethics, and 
condemned gay people to loneliness if committed to celibacy.

You probably notice that I call out romance idolatry, not marriage idolatry. Why is that?

Healthy theology and practice of Christian marriage is not the problem. And romance idolatry takes root long before marriage.

Disney Channel movies and Taylor Swift songs teach our kids that magically coupled love is the best thing that the world has to offer.

And then unfortunately Christians offer the same idolatry to kids and teens, but with some Jesus sprinkles on top.

For example, here’s a quote from a top-selling book about Christian masculinity:

“Deep in his heart, every man longs for a battle to fight, and an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue…A woman doesn't want to be the adventure. She wants to be caught up into something greater than herself…Every woman wants to have a beauty to unveil, to simply and truly be the beauty and be delighted in.”

Did you notice the idol of romance?

From an early age parents and pastors highlight Bible stories and holidays centering romance and marriage. When parents comment things like, “when you get married…” or ask “are you dating anyone?” they don't leave room for stories or celebrations of singleness.

Christian teens often assume they're free to indulge in romance as much as they want as long as they don't cross certain lines.

And 72% of pastors surveyed by Equip believe that if a person desires to marry and have kids, then God wants them to marry.

What difference does it make if our problem is romance idolatry, not marriage idolatry? It means to root out the idol, we’ll have to go deeper and earlier.

I recently taught at a local Christian university about LGBT+ topics. During the Q&A time, a student shared about a few friends that were queer and had been so hurt by Christians that they not only felt repelled by historic sexual ethics but felt like the whole idea of God had been made toxic for them. Then he asked me what he could do or say to fix things.

""Honestly, I don't know,"" I said.

""There's people in my life that I love who are in that place too. The sins of Christians poisoned the well so thoroughly that even going to a church that teaches a revisionist sexual ethic triggers them. The bible, prayer, praise songs--all of it reconnects them with traumatic feelings of fear and pain. And their body screams at them to run.""

""They both desperately want God to be real, and some part of them recoils at the idea of God because what some people have done in the name of God. Because of that, too many of those queer people are never going to know Jesus again. Not because of their sin, but because of the sins of others.""

Straining now, I said, ""How is that fair? It's not.""

And then through tears, ""It's not fair. It's just not fair. I don't know what to say.""

For the first time that I can remember, I just sat and cried for a few seconds from a podium. Eventually I composed myself and I emphasized why it's so important for Christians to confess the collective sins of past Christians:

""Perhaps that confession could do a little bit to reduce the toxicity some queer people feel about God. But ultimately, I don't know if that'll be enough. So maybe my answer is this: Lord, have mercy on us.""

""Lord, have mercy on us Christians who've gotten in the way of the gospel instead of reflecting the love of Jesus to LGBT+ people.""

At one point, they even told me that they were praying against celibacy for me and praying instead that God would lead me to marriage.

At first I was offended. But in time, I understood that my parents were onto something.

My parents didn’t grow up seeing Christians thriving in celibacy. They know any adult peers leveraging their singleness for the sake of the kingdom. The bible’s promise of a flourishing and connected celibacy seemed like a cruel trick.

Ultimately, the blame was on the Church. The Church failed to teach what the bible had to say about vocational singleness to my parents’ generation. It failed to invite my parents’ generation to discern or cultivate intentional communities where those celibate could find family.

What if a decade from now, instead of hesitating to pray for my godson’s discernment (and potentially for his celibacy), I could pray eagerly?!

Over the past decade the number of people who identify as LGBT+ has doubled, particularly among those who identify as pansexual and are opening to choosing a life partner based on something other than greatest physical attraction.

Yet over the same time span, the son of conversion therapy creator Joseph Nicolosi Sr. has created and popularized a new conversion therapy call ""reintegrative therapy"" for gay people trying to get straight married.

What do we do with these seemingly parallel but also contradictory trends?

From the article:
 
""Practitioners of 'reintegrative therapy' claim that it's meaningfully different from the ex-gay therapies of the 90s and 00s. In reality, it's the same haunted house with a fresh coat of paint.

The only difference? The Reintegrative Therapy Association Website website graphic brags that, unlike conversion therapy, reintegrative therapy is trademarked, licensed, and ethics-bound exclusively by this new therapy association.

It's conversion therapy, but with better franchising.""

And later:

""Gen Z and Gen Alpha are generally disillusioned with romance idolatry, regardless of sexual orientation, homophobic attitudes are decreasing among younger generations, and an increasing number of teens and young adults are identifying as pansexual.""

""As you could imagine, all of these factors could lead to rampant, unrestrained sexual indulgence. But there's another possibility, particularly for Gen Z and Gen Alpha Christians.""
