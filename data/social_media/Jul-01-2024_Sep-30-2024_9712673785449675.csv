This weekend, I gathered with brothers and close friends to celebrate the 1-year anniversary of my lifetime commitments to NFOB and vocational singleness!

We prayed, flipped through a photo album gifted for my 1-year anniversary (paper), shared a potluck dinner, desserted on the top tiers of my lifetime commitments cake frozen from a year ago (still yummy), and ended with a galactic paint&sip.

But the night before, I was filled with dread.

A month after my commitments I got the ceremony recording. As I posted about in 2023, a mental health episode of a brother on the day of my commitments meaningfully impacted my experience. So I was eager to re-experience the ceremony by watching the recording.

Then NFOB experienced what I thought would be a momentary blip but turned out to be a months-long, still-healing rough patch. Each month I postponed the rewatch, telling myself, ""I just need to wait until NFOB is in a little bit better place...""

I ended up procrastinating until the night before my 1-year anniversary (a whole year), but finally forced myself to watch the recording, bracing myself for grief and anger.

Instead, I was filled with hope.

I was reminded how many people gathered to celebrate my commitments and to hope for my sake and the sake of NFOB that this crazy idea would work out.

But they were also hoping for themselves, their siblings, and their kids—hoping that there was actually a way for lifelong singles to find lifelong, lived-in human family that could quench their loneliness and enliven their thriving.

Then my 1-year anniversary celebration deepened that hope. I couldn't have made it through the past year without my brothers and friends. Their hugs and potluck prayers reminded me that many people are rooting for us.

Thank you for your tenderness and support!

And God, thank You for giving me a family of my own.

Long before I was born, the brokenness of this world conspired to keep people like me from experiencing Your love through human family.

But a year ago You changed that, and a year later, I'm still blessed beyond my wildest dreams.",0,"09/30/2024 10:37",https://www.instagram.com/p/DAjMeZHv4yu/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,7393,302,4,17,8,2843,2

(instead of depending on me to teach every time)

We just finished the first of a series of training sessions with pastors and Christian school principals for a regional network of churches that serves over 500,000 people.

Equip has been preparing with local church leaders over the past year to take this first step toward training every pastor and parent to minister to teens and young adults about God's wisdom for sexual stewardship.

The best part: I didn’t say a word. I didn't spend a single minute teaching up front.

One of Equip’s core values is building up capacity in local churches so that their churches don’t need us long-term. We turn pastors and parents into experts so that they can carry the work forward for decades to come.

It is a delight to offer Equip’s experience and expertise on LGBT+ topics to local leaders and watch them filter Equip’s content through their own understanding of their church’s context and culture.

Ultimately, long-term ministry efforts led by the hearts and minds and words of local leaders will lead to the biggest impact.

My heart is full from getting to be part of this journey. I'm grateful to God for the work that Equip gets to be a part of. And I’m grateful for those of you who have been praying for and donating to the work of Equip.

Big wins like this are possible because of your prayer and financial support. THANK YOU, and celebrate with us this work we’re all doing together!",106,"09/27/2024 08:41",https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAbQvktJuDs/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,1508,24,1,0,1,1085,

I recently joined Noah Filipiak on the Flip Side Podcast to discuss why it seemed easy to thrive in singleness in college but impossible afterward—and how churches can help post-college.

Step 1: The Problem

Rodney Clapp, in Families at the Crossroads, argues that the Industrial Revolution caused the breakdown of community. With technological advances, more Americans could afford single-family homes and move cities or states frequently.

But we never asked if we should move, just because we could.

Constant relocation destroyed hard-earned, slowly rebuilt community. Single-family homes put distance between neighbors. After work and sleep, little time is left for community, and many of those hours need to be spent on spent cooking, doing the dishes, folding laundry, getting ready for work or bed, and transitioning between activities.

In multi-family homes, these mundane moments could be shared with neighbors. But in single-family homes, they become lost opportunities for connection.

Step 2: The Solution

During the podcast, Noah noted, ""The only place where singles seem to thrive is in college dorms. But there's nothing post-college.""

What if the solution is to never leave the dormitory?

Colleges evolved from monasteries. Historically, monasticism (or some kind of lived-in intentional Christian community) has been the most common way that vocational singles have found family. Perhaps living in a modern monastery is how singles can continue thriving after college.

It’s weird, but vocational singles might need to embrace what’s weird to get what they need, until we reverse the trend of single-family isolation.

And if there’s no intentional Christian community in your area, you could start one! Just gather friends, live together for a year, create rhythms of prayer + meals + community service, and see what happens!

The ex-gay movement seemingly died in the 2010s. Exodus International (the umbrella organization of sexual orientation change effort ""SOCE"" ministries) closed in 2013, admitting that ""99.9% of [participants] have not experienced a change in their orientation.""

By the end of the 2010s, it seemed that evangelical Christians had widely accepted that people don't choose who they're attracted to, SOCEs were harmfully ineffective, and a different solution was needed.

But over the past few years, the ex-gay movement appears to be making a comeback. And if we aren't diligent to expose this new ex-gay activity early, the movement may regrow and lead to another generation of LGBT+ people losing their faith and/or committing suicide.

Who are the three horsemen of the new ex-gay?
1. Reintegrative Therapy
2. Concupiscence Debates
3. Trans Whataboutism

These harbingers aren't particularly clever, but they can be extremely effective if we let them grow unnoticed.

In my latest article in The Living Church, I explore how Christians can use the concepts of systemic racism and biblical racial justice to think about biblical justice for sexual minorities.

After George Floyd's death in 2020 and healthier conversation in white evangelical churches about racism, friends began messaging me some version of the following:

""I’ve become convinced that how Jesus really sees things is more in line with culturally progressive views on racial justice and women in leadership.

""I’ve always believed in a more traditional Christian sexual ethic, but now it’s bothering me that the version of Jesus in my head leans one way on race and women, but then the other on sexual minorities. That seems inconsistent.

""I feel like Jesus wants some form of dignity and justice for gay people as well. Does that mean I need to switch my views on that too?""

These earnest Christians sensed a tension between their beliefs on racial justice, female leadership, and LGBT+ dignity. They hoped to satisfy their God-given yearning for justice for sexual minorities without needing to abandon historic Christian sexual ethics.

What if a kind of systemic homophobia exists in our churches that lingers today and keeps gay Christians from thriving according to biblical sexual ethics?

Moreover, what might it look like for our churches to deconstruct systemic homophobia, make gay Christians whole again, and witness flourishing according to God's wisdom?

Last month I went on a walk-and-talk with a guy who'd been following me on Instagram for a while. He messaged me and said he'd almost given up hope, but he thought he'd give it a chance and reach out to me.

As we crisscrossed the neighborhood, he said he started following me because I posted honestly about my ""struggles with sexual purity,"" as he called it.

He was secretly battling addiction and found it refreshing to hear someone speak openly about sexual addiction, gay desire, rooting out sin, and chasing after Jesus.

But, he said that for the past five years or so he'd go almost 12 months without slipping up, but then he’d sext an old fling or download a hookup app and meet a stranger.

""Pieter, I know you post about still struggling with temptation, but I think I'm too far gone. I think I'm gonna give up.""

I responded with some encouragement to keep up the good fight, but he quipped back, ""You don't struggle like me. You post about sexual sin, but you probably just watch porn once a year or something like that.""

I reminded him of social media posts he had commented on where I named my deep regret for past sexual sins and the ways my mistakes enabled others to sin.

""You don't get it. People who are addicted as bad as I am don't get better.""

Usually, I hesitate to share about the specifics of my sexual sin. Sometimes I worry that giving too much detail glorifies the sin and tempts others. Or maybe I'm just ashamed that I've disobeyed God so severely.

But this time, it seemed like I needed to be transparent. I told him that over the past five years I'd relapsed twice, thoroughly losing my sobriety. In between those two relapses, there were a few times when I crossed boundaries with guys that were less severe but still sinful.

I shared that I'd had some messy interactions with people I saw as peers but who (I later learned) looked up to me. I was honest that I was still trying to figure out whether physical affection like cuddling was wise for me…[con’t in comments]",0,"09/09/2024 06:41",https://www.instagram.com/p/C_ss2qoxw1i/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,11613,404,17,66,65,4032,1

And if you return a few months later still single and with the same burdens, you’re blamed for your challenges: “You should have taken my advice. You don’t have to struggle. Just start dating!” 

It begs the question: Is it really better to marry than to burn? What does Paul actually mean in 1 Corinthians 7:9 when he says, “But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.”

Equip just finished a training with church leaders and parents at a church that's recently emerged from denominational debates about LGBT+ topics.

When the pastor introduced Equip, he said, ""We should have started having these conversations years ago. We didn't. But we're doing it now!""

Like many churches, his church recognizes that arguments about sexual ethics became a distraction from the more important work of actually helping LGBT+ people embrace and thrive according to historic sexual ethics.

At one point the pastor came to tears thinking about the teens and families who had been underserved by their church's fear of speaking up about Christ's love and wisdom for queer people.

LGBT+ people didn't know whether it was a safe place to share their story. Parents didn't have the training they needed to lead their kids in age-appropriate conversation. No one considering longterm singleness felt honored or knew how to find stable community.

""But I think today was a watershed moment,"" the pastor said as he closed us in prayer. ""For the first time in awhile I feel hope about this area of ministry in our church, because we don't have to figure it out alone anymore. Now we've got Equip.""

“Christians have historically understood the Bible to teach that God has a preference for whether each of us steps into vocational singleness or Christian marriage.

God wants us to ask Him which gift He wants to give us, and He wants us to trust Him, even if He seems to be calling us to the one we don't prefer. He wants us to give Him time and space to show us why His preference is best for us.

Jesus says in Matthew 19 that only those who've been called to Christian marriage will be willing to accept His teachings about Christian marriage. Later in verse 12, Jesus says that only those who've been called to vocational singleness will be willing to accept His teachings about vocational singleness.

Then in 1 Corinthians 7:7, Paul says that he wishes all were like him—all were called to vocational singleness—but God has given each his own gift. God will call some to vocational singleness and God will call others to Christian marriage.

A few months ago someone online accused me of sex-shaming and asked, “What’s so wrong with watching pornography, anyway?”

I knew the Sunday school answer, but this person was marginally Christian and genuinely seeking a convincing rationale.

Maybe you’re a parent of a teen who’s asked the same question, a spouse of someone using pornography, or a teen wrestling with how “normal” porn seems to be among some of your friends.

So, why should Christians resist temptations to view pornography?

Because it hurts the human on the other side of the screen, it hurts the viewer, and it hurts God.

The people in pornographic images bear God’s image and should be treated with dignity, including being asked for consent. 

Viewing pornography uses the performer’s body and their image of God without permission, turning them into objects for consumption.

Moreover, viewing pornography enables sex slavery. Many actors are trapped in sex slavery, and each video click gives the sex slavers site traffic and the ability to profit from ads on their page (even if the porn is “free” to the viewer).

If that isn’t reason enough, using pornography hurts the viewer and hurts God.

God’s wisdom isn’t arbitrary. His Scriptures are warning us to stay away from things that will harm us.

Everything about this world is broken, including our sexualities and our desires. Thankfully, God looked at the world, noticed what would bring us or others harm, and warned us in His Scriptures to avoid harmful things.

“All sin is fun for a season,” as they say, but eventually repeated pornography use will harm the viewer, often in the form of addiction.

75% of young adult men and women view pornography at least once a month. Different estimate find that between 20-30% of men are addicted to porn.

Porn addiction leads to the need for more extreme content, impairs decision-making, and warps our view of others. It can damage healthy sexual intimacy and numb our ability to connect with God and others.

And last but not least, viewing pornography hurts God. When we choose to do sexual things that harm ourselves (or another) and disobey God’s wisdom, we sin.

In my latest article in Anglican Compass, I recount a time years ago when I recited the common confession after a moral failure and wrestled with whether I meant the memorized words:

""I woke up with a moral hangover. 

I tried to fall back asleep to avoid the guilt and shame swirling in my heart, but I was restless. So I forced myself to throw on some running clothes and step out the door. It was cold. Fitting, I thought.

Running tends to help get me mentally and emotionally unstuck, so I hoped it'd do the trick once again. After five minutes of chaotic inner dialogue, I tried to make some progress.

Maybe I should pray and confess to God. That'll make things better, right? Maybe that will bring some relief. I don't really know what to say. 

So I launched into the common confession that millions of Christians around the world use every week:

Most merciful God, I confess that I have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed, by what I have done, and by what I have left undone. I have not loved you with my whole heart; I have not loved my neighbors as myself. I am truly sorry and I humbly repent. For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ, have mercy on me and forgive me; that I may delight in your will, and walk in your ways, to the glory of your Name. Amen.

I waited, hoping a flood of relief would rush in. But nothing seemed to change. So I tried to dig deeper.

What's really going on in there? Inside me?

Well, if I'm being honest, I feel myself resisting confession because...""

Later the article picks back up:

""...At this point in past moral hangovers, I would just shame myself about resisting confession, beat myself up a little bit more, repeat the common confession a few more times, and do my best to move on. But this time, I leaned in...""

They ask, “What if a same-sex married couple with kids starts coming to your church, all of them become Christians, and the couple both become convinced of historic sexual ethics? What do they do next?”

As much as you might think this is a fantasy scenario question that seminary students get excited about debating, these circumstances actually come up in churches more often than you’d think.

Here’s how I respond to pastors:

“There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer to this one. So first, I suggest you pray and discern together and ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom and tenderness. I can share with you what I’ve noticed works for some couples. I’ve actually witnessed a good number of same-sex female couple with kids in this exact situation.

On their own, they come to know Jesus and become convinced of historic sexual ethics. As a result, on their own, they became convinced that they were never married in the eyes of God, and that any future romance or sex would be a sin. But they also don’t believe that raising their kids separately, halfway across the country, is the best way to care for their kids either.

So they choose to recognize to themselves, their kids, and their church that they are not married. They ceased sharing a bed or any romance or sex. But then they chose to continue doing life together as sisters. They raise the kids together in the same house. They continue to be legally married for the financial benefits. And they invite some of their siblings in Christ to hold them accountable to refraining from romance or sex.

Now, again, I’m not offering this as a one-size-fits-all solution.

I want to underscore that this has usually only worked out when the couple arrived at these conclusions on their own. When the holy spirit guided them to these convictions. This rarely works out when a pastor or leader is trying to twist someone’s arm into arriving at this.",164,"08/08/2024 09:28",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-amIfmPFpS/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,5241,179,19,19,23,2261,3

People on the left who disagree with gay Christians like me (who hold a historic sexual ethic) often accuse us of internalized homophobia.

While they intend to discredit our beliefs with this accusation—suggesting we're only committed to God's wisdom because of deep-seated shame, they're right (in part).

I've definitely been haunted by internalized homophobia, although it's not why I became convinced of historic sexual ethics or still hold those convictions.

Internalized homophobia is when a person (particularly a gay person) comes to personally believe the negative ideas about gay people they've heard from others (media, neighbors, etc.).

I grew up hearing a horrible stereotype of gay people: that all gay people went to group sex parties, had AIDS, were addicted to drugs, and hated God.

That stereotype eventually taught me to hate myself, because I came to believe that God would only tolerate me if I loathed myself.

It’s a twisted and destructive form of shame. The Enemy used homophobia around me to trick me into believing that if I hated myself enough, my attractions could be eliminated or mastered.

Or if I couldn't get rid of my attractions and kept making mistakes, at least I could show God how much I despised myself. Perhaps with enough self-disgust, God might forgive me and tolerate me.

Unfortunately, this internalized homophobia can linger for decades. For many in the closet, it leads to hatred of anything related to pride, anything feminine, and anything associated with homosexuality. 

It took years to root this out with my therapist's help.

A breakthrough moment came when I finally noticed how unfairly ""those gay people over there"" were treated. I yearned for God to wrap his arms around those hurting and make things right. Then a switch flipped.

I realized that if I saw other people that way and guessed that God's heart broke for them too, then God must have just as much compassion for me. He knows it's not my fault.

I wanted to check back in with yall about what I learned from my polls on Insta, FB, Twitter, and Threads re: the differences between bisexuality vs. pansexuality.

Interestingly, a good number of people said they basically mean the same thing but younger people use ""pan"". Another cluster of people said that ""pan"" means different things to different people and can't be defined.

Among those who identify as pansexual and responded to my polls...
- 70% said they're attracted to people regardless of their gender identity/expression or physical characteristics associated with biological sex
- 65% said that they have chosen culturally/philosophically to be open to falling in love with anyone (as opposed to it being an unavoidable/inherent sexual orientation)
- 85% said that they weren't open to dating trans people
- 80% of respondents were females (assigned at birth)

As a gay person who has had to argue for decades that I didn't chose my sexual orientation, I found it interesting that most respondents said they chose to be pansexual (as opposed to it being an unavoidable/inherent sexual orientation).

I was also surprised that while most defined their pansexuality as an openness to falling in love with people regardless of gender or biosex characteristics, most weren't open to dating trans people.

This was a small sample size, so I don't pretend that these polls speak for all pan-identifying people. But I thought it was interesting how the aggregate responses from actual pan people differed from how the internet seemed to define pansexuality.

Ohh, and I polled people who aren't pansexual about whether they're primarily attracted to gender identity/expression, physical characteristics associated with biological sex, or both. Everyone said they considered biosex characteristics, and 65% said they aren't meaningfully attracted to gender identity/expression.",0,"07/30/2024 09:35",https://www.instagram.com/p/C-DcFupMYyt/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,5542,90,1,14,11,2421,

Over the past year, I've increasingly noticed teens, celebrities, and some Christians identifying as pan or pansexual. I've read the internet definitions, and as someone who teaches about sexuality for a living I'm supposed to know what it means to be pan, with precision.

But I'm gonna be honest. I feel a little lost.

So instead of teaching, I come to you today to learn!

In particular, I'm hoping that people who identify as pan would be willing to comment or direct message me about the following questions distinguishing pansexuality from bisexuality:

1. If, like many pan people, you would say that you're attracted to people regardless of gender/biosex, could you clarify which of those it is? Could you clarify whether you don't consider gender, you don't consider biosex, or you don't consider either?

2. To what extent do you experience inherent physical/sexual attractions to both males and females similar to bisexual people versus experiencing meaningfully more inherent physical/sexual attractions to one more than the other but choose to be open to all?

3. To what extent is your pansexuality different from being bisexual because you are generally open to dating trans people where as you generally assume that bisexual people are not open to dating trans people?

4. I've heard that (for some) pansexuality differs from bisexuality in that bi people generally can't help but be attracted to both males and females in some meaningful way, where as pan people (regardless of inherent physical/sexual attractions) are choosing culturally/philosophically to be open to falling in love with anyone without considering gender/biosex. Does that fit for you?

To be clear, I know there's overlap between all of these. I'm particularly looking for help identifying where the differences are between bisexuality and pansexuality, more often than not…[con’t in comments]",0,"07/25/2024 08:58",https://www.instagram.com/p/C92f-0FRa7J/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,10034,161,3,23,29,4105,1

I recently wrote for Christ and Pop Culture about my experience watching Inside Out 2 and painful reminders that spending puberty in the closet wasn't normal.

God didn't mean for the innocence of my childhood to be lost so swiftly and so devastatingly.

""...I had high expectations going into Inside Out 2. The introduction of more emotions was tasteful and the exploration of one's core self amidst the chaos of puberty was well-executed. Still, something seemed off. Something was missing for me.

It took me a few days to find the words, but once I found time to process the movie with some therapist friends, I started to put my finger on it: ""I dunno. I guess the dilemma the human character faced seemed too mild. Like, for 8th grade, it seemed too innocent, too light to be real life.""

""I mean, what did you expect?"" one friend asked.

""Well, when I think about an 8th grader's inner life, I guess I expect it to be darker. Like, maybe the kid should be dealing with deep shame or a more stark split-screen between who they are and who they're presenting to others. Or maybe the kid should struggle with isolation and loneliness even as the kid seems to have friends...""

And then it hit me. I was describing my own emotional experience in puberty, but my experience wasn't normal.

I spent puberty in the closet.

I've been out for more than a decade. I share my story about faith and sexuality for a living. Even so, it's easy to forget how painful my teenage years were. It's easy to miss how abnormal my puberty was. It's easy to take for granted that my years of torture while in the closet were an unnecessary evil. God desperately wanted me to be spared of the tragedy of the closet, but the unfaithfulness of the Church fell short.

God didn't mean for me to find some of my friends sexually arousing, then immediately plunge into self-hate where I banged my head against the proverbial (and sometimes literal) wall for having disgusting desires, and then pursue purity with an obsessive religiosity because I feared that Christ's work on the cross couldn't cover my abomination...""

Rosaria Butterfield recently argued that none of us have LGBT+/queer neighbors because LGBT+ people do not exist.

She asserted that God didn't intend for anyone to be queer (no one is ontologically gay/trans/ace); therefore Christians who concede that their neighbors are LGBT+ are complicit in a lie that will lead their neighbors further away from Jesus.

Gay celibate Christians like me have a complicated relationship with Mrs. Butterfield, particularly after she said that people like me aren't genuinely Christian. Another time she eagerly recalled wanting to throw a brick at a gay Christian who (accurately) described her marriage as a mixed-orientation marriage.

As I combed through Butterfield's recent article, here's what she got wrong (and right) about sexual orientation and ontology:

Despite the article's distasteful tone, I agree with Butterfield that God didn't intend for me to be gay and that I'm not a fundamentally different kind of person than my straight Christian friends.

And I agree that Christians don't need special skills to befriend an LGBT+ neighbor or need a different kind of gospel.

But if Christians fully apply Butterfield’s advice and attempt to communicate to their LGBT+ neighbor in subtle (or not so subtle ways) that the neighbor isn't actually LGBT+, believers will just push people further away from Jesus.

Instead, I'd suggest Christians heed Paul’s advice in 1 Corinthians 9:20-22. Meet people where they’re at. Seek to respectfully understand what matters to your neighbor. 

Ohh, and Butterfield seems to conveniently forget that there are LGBT-identifying Christians like me who don't see ourselves as ontologically queer but use various sexual orientation labels phenomenologically.

We don't believe God intended for us to be LGBT+, but we notice what's different about our experience and label our experience using the words most people would use to describe us….[con’t in comments]",0,"07/11/2024 09:07",https://www.instagram.com/p/C9SdytTR6u0/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,15719,592,80,94,156,5966,11

I recently shared about my ongoing sexual addiction recovery. And I’ve posted in the past about the fact that same-sex attraction does not inherently lead to sexual addiction.

But it’s true that gay people struggle with sexual addiction at higher rates than some other populations. Why?

The closet.

Even into the 2020s, surveys continue to find that the average LGBT+ person waits five years after noticing same-sex attractions or gender incongruence to share with a parent or a pastor.

Teens are still afraid that if/when they share their story, they’ll be called an abomination, told they’re dirty and disgusting, bullied, or kicked out of their house or church.

They spend five years making sense of big questions around identity and self-worth without the love and wisdom of parents, left alone in the dark with the lies of the Enemy and the broken world around us.

For many this leads to loneliness, shame, anxiety, depression, suicidality, and doubt about whether God loves us or even exists.

The closet is a breeding ground for addiction. It was for me.

We drowned in pain, and we were desperate for something to help us numb and escape. 

We were afraid that if we got too close to friends, we’d develop a crush or accidentally out ourselves, so we settled for shallow friendship.

For many trapped in the closet, lust and pornography seemed like the only way to escape pain and connect with something. That perfect storm taught too many of us to repeatedly medicate our pain with something sexual.

Then like any addiction, as our pain continued, our addiction grew. Porn was no longer good enough. We needed a bigger dose of something more.

To be clear, I’m not trying to absolve myself or anyone else of responsibility for our decisions. Regardless of addiction, I’m responsible for my actions and for my recovery.

But consider this: how would you view a straight person who secretly experienced five years of repeated trauma in their teens, developed an addiction to pain-killers, and are still struggling with imperfect recovery into adulthood?

How are gay people like me much different?",143,"07/02/2024 08:58",https://www.instagram.com/reel/C87RfFpxlJP/,"IG reel",,Lifetime,4955,137,19,24,26,2258,4
