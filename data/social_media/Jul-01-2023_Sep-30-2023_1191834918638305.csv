I'm back! And I've got lots to share :) I went into my sabbatical hoping to detox from workaholism, and in the process, God taught me even more than I expected about what over-working has cost me over the years.

In the past I used work to entertain myself, distract myself, and numb myself.

From what? Fear.

Workaholism enabled me to avoid the painful reality that life in a broken world is scary (and that I have much less control than I'd like). I've been addicted to throwing myself into productivity to avoid uncomfortable truths.

Yet what I didn't fully appreciate until this sabbatical was how much over-working has cost me. It's disconnected me from myself, from the people I hope to love, and from God.

So over my sabbatical I got serious about connecting with my fear, and boy, did it have things to say!

I realized that some part of me is afraid to depend on anything good in my life because that good could get yanked away at any moment.

While I've been blessed in countless ways over the years that haven't been taken away, there have been unpredictably painful losses. And that unpredictability is key. I never know which good thing to hold loosely. So I hold them all loosely.

The result is that some part of me keeps me from trusting or fully enjoying anything in my life. Which feels crazy, but at the same time reasonable. 

My sabbatical involved a lot of grieving love I've hesitated to receive or share over the years because of that fear.

Yet the solution isn't to judge my fear or find even more effective ways of ignoring it. Instead, the key to connecting better with myself, God, and my family is to connect (particularly) with my fear.

How? I started practicing some new rhythms and boundaries over the sabbatical that I plan on continuing (and you can hold me accountable to):

1. Take concrete steps to work less by blocking the internet on my computer at 8 pm and inviting my family/coworkers to call me out if I'm working outside of work hours.

In anticipation of my commitments, I've been journaling about what my brothers have meant to me and why I love them. I ended up writing a love letter, of sorts, and I wanted to share it with all of you :)

""I choose to love you for the rest of my life because of the love we've already shared. And I look forward to spending the rest of our lives nourishing that love and sharing it with others, all so that more people come to know the Savior who made this all possible.

...I love you because you've held me and reassured me during my worst failures. I love you because you've seen me through seasons of silence from God and doubt that imperiled my faith.

...I love you because you've made it easier to love. You've made it easier for me to believe a God exists and loves me (because nothingness couldn't bless me so deeply). You've made it easier for me to love others, particularly those that my selfish heart has found it challenging to love.

You've made it easier for me to be patient and be vulnerable. You've made it easier for me to put down my work, believe that it'll be okay, and be present with those I've been given to love.

...Most of all, I love you and will continue to love you because I choose you. I will love you because I have committed to you—because I want to know what it feels like to live with and love the same men for a lifetime, and then look back decades later and savor what has been earned and built.

I love you because you'll be the men who will hold my hand when the people we love pass, who will love me harder when the world cancels me, and who will love me even when my ugliest parts show.

...That's why I choose to love you today, and for the rest of my life.""

Leading up to my lifetime commitments, I’ve gotten some uncertain responses. For example, some felt my “bachelor” party was a little too extra with our matching shirts and wolf-howling-at-the-moon wine&paint session. So how big of a deal is this? To be honest, I think this is going to be the second most important day of my life (after my baptism)! 

That’s worth celebrating in a huge way. I’m planning on having formal wear and flowers. Organ and brass quintet music. A processional followed by formal vows. 

I’m celebrating with a bachelor party, rehearsal dinner, and a formal reception with jazz, cake and toasts. And after those celebrations, I have a commitments vacation in Europe planned. 

Altogether, I’ve planned these moments to help me believe that my vocation to kingdom singleness and my family with NFOB is just as beautiful, just as worth celebrating, and just as valuable as a marriage. 

I need a ceremony—a big embodied moment—to not only convince my mind, but to reassure my body and soul that God is really doing something. These celebrations will help me trust that God is really giving me the full gift of vocational singleness to thrive in my vocation, that He will truly give that 100-fold provision of family in this life and next.

I need help believing that God has given me an irrevocable call to fully commit myself to the undivided attention that vocational singleness can offer my kingdom work. And I need help committing to this family of brothers so that they know I will never leave them.

I’m hoping this huge celebration will help my restless mind, heart, and feet know where I'm staying, who I'm staying with, and what work that staying will empower.",0,"09/26/2023 08:21",https://www.instagram.com/p/CxqOxssLoFA/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,3376,262,15,2,32,9

For me, celibacy isn’t a consolation prize or a second-class vocation. I'm confident God would have called me to vocational singleness even if I were straight.

It’s true that experiencing same-sex attraction and being committed to historic sexual ethics meant I couldn’t default to romantic relationship with the people I am most attracted to. My circumstances forced me to pause and think more intentionally about what my options were and what I would pursue.

But during that intentional time of discernment, I discovered that God had always planned to call me to vocational singleness, regardless of my sexual orientation. At my upcoming lifetime commitments, I will joyfully say “yes” to God’s invitation to permanently leverage my singleness for the sake of serving the poor and needy with single-minded devotion. 

In the same way, the Nashville Family of Brothers isn’t just for gay men. It's a family for any Christian man, regardless of sexual orientation, called to vocational singleness for the sake of God’s kingdom. Even among current brothers, we have a mix of stories and backgrounds (like any family of God should)!

Every Christian, gay or straight, should discern whether God is calling them to vocational singleness or Christian marriage (instead of assuming their preference is God’s preference).

The short answer: whomever God gives me to love.

You see, NFOB isn’t a chosen family, it’s a given family. When I make lifetime commitments to NFOB later this month, I’m committing to *whomever* eventually makes lifetime commitments to our family. And that’s pretty scary.

I won’t get to choose who’ll be in our family. NFOB isn’t a popularity contest–any Christian man who’s genuinely discerned that he’s called to vocational singleness in the context of our family can do so.

They will be my family for a lifetime. 

This commitment stands in contrast to preference-based romance and dating. We often choose our lovers (and friends) based on who serves us best. 

But I won’t get to curate the family I’m joining. The men I’ll call family in the coming decades probably won’t be the people I would have first chosen as friends. And THANK GOD–I choose poorly.

So I'm bringing my fears to yall and hoping you can give me a dose of reality:

I've shared before that I'll make commitments in a church, administered by an ecumenically Christian group of pastors in priestly collars, surrounded by dressed-up friends and family, and accompanied by a brass quintet and organ.

But some of you have asked what specific vows will be made and how the rest of the commitments liturgy will support that.

We'll begin and end with some of my favorite worship songs about kingdom work, family in the body of Christ, and surrendering to God's care.

Friends will read various passages about vocational singleness. Everyone gathered will chant a psalm about Christian family. The rest of the NFOB guys will lead us in confessing the Nicene Creed.

A pastor friend will offer a brief sermon to help orient guests to what's taking place, how that's rooted in historic biblical practices, and (most importantly) how living out these commitments should preach the gospel.

There will be a time of corporate confession and corporate prayer to prepare for my commitments.

Then finally, I'll make commitments through call and response saying, ""I will, the Lord being my helper."" My parents, all in attendance, and the other guys in NFOB will commit to support me.

And as the pastors gathered lay their hands on me and my mentor anoints me with oil, he will call upon the Lord:

""Pieter, now that you have made lifetime commitments to vocational singleness, to simplicity in your finances, to serve the Nashville Family of Brothers as your family, and to obey the monastery’s Community Covenant, receive the gift of vocational singleness and be bound to this family.

In this sacramental moment, accept God’s provision of grace to keep your commitments, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.""

That's why I need to make my commitments publicly and solemnly. I believe (as the Church has historically taught) that God will fundamentally change something about me when I receive that fuller gift of vocational singleness.

God knew this summer would include some setbacks, so He made sure I was on sabbatical to provide plenty of bandwidth. I'm grateful.

One of those tough moments was 24 hours when I seriously doubted re-committing to the Nashville Family of Brothers.

Back in June during one of our recurring leaders meetings of brothers who've been around NFOB longer, the topic of ownership came up. I made what I thought was an uncontroversial statement that each of us needed to take more responsibility.

Long story short, in response I *thought* I heard each of the other guys reveal that they weren't willing to do any more to make sure our family was healthy.

I *thought* I learned that I'd be stuck carrying this family by myself (for a lifetime) if I made lifetime commitments. If that were the case, I wondered whether I even wanted NFOB.

Emphasis on the word ""thought"".

The next day, we discovered that we had misunderstood each other (because I had communicated poorly).

But for 24 hours, I was paralyzed with fear that no one else in our family was willing to work to keep our family going.

At this point, all of the married people reading this post are empathetically chuckling, because they've experienced this scary miscommunication about commitment dozens of times.

Apparently, misunderstanding each other, having different ways of expressing our responsibility to each other, and experiencing momentary terror is pretty normal for families of all kinds.

So if you're married, or you're trying to scrape together some kind of intentional Christian community of your own, please know that every family has scary moments like these.

When I make lifetime commitments to vocational singleness and to NFOB next month, I want some kind of physical symbol to remind me of my commitments and help me share my story with others.

So I decided to get a tattoo.

It's on my wrist because I want it to be visible most of the time, and I decided to get a tattoo of the Nashville Family of Brothers' new logo. Here's what it means:

Four hands represent Christian brothers who are gathered into a family by their common bond in Jesus Christ. He is the vine in Whom we each abide and through Whom we hope to bear much fruit.

The hands hold four objects representing the four lifetime commitments brothers make. The key symbolizes our commitment of family to offer each other our time, presence, care, and vulnerability as our lifelong family.

The crown symbolizes our commitment of vocational singleness to permanently give up romance and marriage to instead do kingdom work with undivided attention. The book symbolizes our commitment of obedience to live according to the wisdom of the Scriptures and NFOB's Community Covenant.

The cup symbolizes our commitment of simplicity and service with our resources. Christ poured out his love for each of us, and in turn we strive to pour out to others by stewarding our time and money with modesty and generosity.

I look forward to people asking about the tattoo and giving me a chance to share why I've decided to exchange romance + kids for kingdom work with undivided attention + family with brothers in Christ!

When I shared about my spiritual dryness with one of the mentors at L'Abri, he encouraged me to read a section of ""The Screwtape Letters"". It'd been 2010 since I read the book:

""God relies on the troughs even more than on the peaks...God will set [believers] off with communications of His presence which, though faint, seem great to them, with emotional sweetness, and easy conquest over temptation.

But He never allows this state of affairs to last long. Sooner or later, God withdraws, if not in fact, at least from their conscious experience, all those supports and incentives.

He leaves a human to stand up on its own legs—to carry out from the will alone duties which have lost all relish.

It is during such trough periods, much more than during the peak periods, that humans grow into the support of people God wants them to be. Hence the prayers offered in the state of dryness are those which please God best...

God wants humans to learn to walk and must therefore take away His hand; and if only the will to walk is really there God is please even more with their stumbles...

[God is most pleased] when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending, to do God's will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.""

It's difficult to explain how powerfully this passage seemed to describe my experience, honor my pain, and give me hope.

Perhaps my dryness is God withdrawing that shallow emotional sweetness so that I can learn to love the Giver more than His gifts.

And perhaps (instead of being disappointed with my lack of emotionality) God has been deeply pleased by my imperfect faithfulness, pained prayers, and honest stumbles over the past decade.

I sure hope so.

My mentor suggested I start my sabbatical off with a workaholism detox (of sorts) at a no-tech retreat center, and I'm so glad I spent a week at L'Abri near Boston.

L'Abri are intentional Christian communities across the globe that offer guests space for contemplation. Top of my list was re-reading my favorite book: The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.

(pictured: the library, running path, wood-splitting, and New England beauty at L'Abri that nurtured my contemplative detox)

It's an allegory that has provided different insight each time I've read it.

In the Alchemist, the protagonist thinks satisfaction will come from finding the treasure he desires, as quickly as possible.

But unbeknownst to the protagonist, God takes him on a journey across continents that teaches him how to appreciate and understand the treasure, only to discover that it was mere feet from where the story began.

While reading the Alchemist at L'Abri, I couldn't help but see the same pattern in my own life.

Over the past decade, there have been various goals and sought-after achievements that have given me purpose. At times I even believe that God had promised me those successes.

But God had better plans.

Sometimes the achievements I thought were best weren't actually what I needed, but God let me believe those were the destination because He knew nothing else would motivate me better.

Other times, God knew I would actually succeed as I hoped, but He knew I couldn't handle that success yet. So He led me down paths to teach me and prepare me for that responsibility before I succeeded.

I'm *slowly* learning that it would have been easy for God to instantaneously grant me success. But I would have squandered it. Success is the easy part. Discovering the wisdom to steward the success is the hard part.

Yet if He had told me a decade ago what would be necessary to get to today, I probably would have walked away a dozen times.

So I'm grateful for God's patient pit stops and letting me believe what I needed to keep going.

If bachelor parties (at their best) are celebrations of the past and preparation for a lifetime commitment in the near future, then vocational singles deserve a bachelor party as much as any groom-to-be.

So in July, some of the people who've been instrumental in my journey thus far helped me celebrate and prepare, complete with...
- matching wolf tshirts (yes, I cropped mine)
- mimosa&paint session creating a wolf-howling-at-the-moon scene
- laser tag
- pool day
- dressing up for dinner
- spa day complete with massages, face masks, eye masks, and foot masks
- getting the tattoo for my lifetime commitments (more on that in a future post)

My favorite moment was Friday night when everyone reminisced about the last decade together, reminded me what I've meant to them, and ushered me toward my lifetime commitments with encouragements and blessings.

My bachelor party was another beautiful opportunity to reassure my heart that my commitments to vocational singleness and NFOB are worth celebrating just as much as any marriage.

And the scale of celebration reassures me that God is eager to bless and sustain my commitments and family just as much as any other!

The season of events leading up to a lifetime commitment to marriage seem to be a rite of passage that ensures people understand the gravity of the commitments they're making and blesses them spiritually, emotionally, and materially for the life to come.

If that's the case, why wouldn't those committing to lifetime singleness need just as much preparation and blessing?
