This year Equip passed a milestone of training over 20,000 Christian leaders since getting started 8 years ago and launched strategic partnerships with campus ministries, church networks, and Christian university collaboratives.

I'm so grateful for 5 guys who made commitments to the Nashville Family of Brothers, including 2 who made three-year commitments. My heart is starting to trust that God is building us into a real family.

Thank you to Christ and Pop Culture, Ekstasis Magazine, Fathom Magazine, RENEW.org, Outreach Magazine, Awaken, and The Williamson Herald for each publishing some of my writing in 2022.

I was humbled to serve some of the hardest-working counseling clients I've ever met with in my private practice. They remind me weekly what's at stake in our churches.

While 2022 began with sadness and apprehension about who would lead my church and our diocese, I couldn't be more hopeful about the leadership and discipleship of Fr. Andrew and Bp. Alex.

Here's to hoping 2023 is as blessed!

Feel free to share in the comments some you're grateful for from 2022!",0,"01/01/2023 08:04",https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm4OvZJryFH/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,125,220,0,15,3,

Missio Alliance recently published a piece I wrote about volunteer versus conscription armies and the similarities to called versus involuntary celibacy.

Research shows that volunteer soldiers are more disciplined, have greater commitment, and are more effective on the battlefield. The only challenge: recruitment, requiring better pay, and a society that values/honors military service.

Similarly, Christians who embrace a calling to vocational singleness can be more effective and have greater endurance, particularly when they're publicly honored and supported by their faith communities.

Vocational singles are freed to focus on their Kingdom work with undivided attention, train for their calling in more intentional ways, develop greater expertise, and invest more deeply in the ways God has called them to bring forth the New Heavens and New Earth.

Before committing to vocational singleness, celibates count the cost and benefits of giving up romance and sex for a lifetime to leverage the time and energy parents use in raising children to bring forth the Kingdom with undivided attention.

They've counted the cost, and they're ready to pay it, leading to greater personal ownership of their vocational singleness and of the larger mission of God.

The catch?! It must be publicly honored and supported by local churches in order to be viable and effective.

During the first few centuries of the Church, tens of thousands of celibates in cities of no more than 100,000 people (you read that right, 20% of people in a small city) voluntarily committed to lifetime celibacy, using their availability to serve their city and their church.

In large measure, they were honored by their community for their sacrifice through public celebrations of celibacy commitments, giving friends and family the opportunity to gather and honor vocational singles and inviting friends and family to provide ongoing accountability and practical support.

Admittedly, vocational singles today don't have the same institutional support that United States Army soldiers do.

When I recently taught Ecuadorian high school students at a Christian school about God's wisdom for our sexualities, we concluded with advice for resisting sexual temptation.

We explored how the Enemy's schemes are actually pretty predictable, and as such, how we can reverse-engineer a good defense.

Have you noticed these common characteristics of sexual temptation?

1. The Enemy promises (lies) that pleasure/connection will be deeply satisfying and won't hurt anyone.
2. The Enemy tempts us when we are lonely.
3. The Enemy tempts us when we're burdened with painful feelings.
4. The Enemy gets us in a habit of sin, becoming seemingly automatic.

Thankfully, we can predictably prepare a good defense:

1. When you experience sexual temptation, pause, and try to identify the false promise of consequence-less connection. Then call it what it is: a lie.

2. Throughout your day and week, be proactive about getting healthy emotional, spiritual, physical, and intellectual connection so that you're not lonely when sexual temptation shows up.

3. Practice feeling through your feelings in healthy ways. Sin often helps us postpone or temporarily numb painful feelings, but they return the next day. The only way to get beyond painful feelings is to feel them.

Painful feelings aren't our enemies. They're asking us to care for ourselves. Fear is asking us to pay attention to something risky and wisely prepare. Anger is asking us to notice injustice and do something. Sadness is asking us to grieve a loss.

4. If you've found yourself in a seemingly-automatic habit of sexual sin, ask for professional help. Addictions are difficult to kick without an expert. And be prepared for the solution to involve practical and inconvenient efforts.

We are not powerless to resist sexual temptation. With insight, strength from the Holy Spirt, and support from friends and experts, we can expose the Enemy's schemes and effectively respond.",0,"03/28/2023 10:04",https://www.instagram.com/p/CqVx9-VuNbw/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,305,317,2,7,129,

One if my friends recently died by suicide. Suicide is always a tragedy. This is not the way the world is supposed to be.

Some are tortured by a lie of the Enemy that suicide is a good solution. It is never a solution. For the sake of life, Christ-followers must expose the Enemy's lie and share God's wisdom.

As Christians filled with the Holy Spirit, we know that there is always hope for fuller life in Jesus. Destroying life is never better than enduring the pain of the present.

If we believe in the power of the Holy Spirit, then we cannot believe that the future is worth abandoning.

But when people are sick, when they struggle with the disease of depression, the Enemy's lie seems plausible.

If you or a friend is struggling with the sickness of depression, what are some real solutions (as opposed to the lie of suicide)?

Research has consistently found four ingredients (in no particular order) to be most effective at reducing depression/suicidality:
1. In-person talk therapy with a counselor to address grief/loss
2. Regular exercise/physical activity
3. Anti-depressants
4. A broader community of social support

If you or a friend is sick, get help. Be willing to take life-disrupting steps to get well. Your life may depend on it.

P.S. I've not named my friend or shared fond memories because scientific studies have shown that publicizing specific suicides increases suicidality in others. Know that I loved this friend dearly and miss this friend deeply. Grief is weird.

I recently had the privilege of teaching 7th through 12th graders at a Christian school in Ecuador about God's wisdom for our sexualities.

We focused on the ways God made all of us for connection in the context of community.

Our sexualities are our need for community and our capacity for connection.

And because God made us mind, body, and spirit, we need connection on a spiritual, emotional, physical, and intellectual level.

Moreover, God designed two best ways for Christians to enjoy connection in community: vocational singleness and Christian marriage.

Of course, high schoolers aren't called to either vocational singleness or Christian marriage yet, but instead find themselves in a period of uncommitted singleness before either vocations.

The problem: the world isn't the way it's supposed to be. The brokenness of the world has also impacted our sexualities.

But thankfully, God revealed in His scriptures harmful things to stay away from (which He calls sin) and encouragement to seek vocational singleness or Christian marriage.

We explored God's wisdom for the each of the ways broken sexuality shows up in our world today, including ways our bodies are broken, ways the decisions of others harm us, and ways we may chose to disobey God's wisdom for our sexualities.

I'm so grateful for the opportunity to share with young believers about God's designs for our world & bodies and the best ways to enjoy connection in the context of community!

After five years of intentional discernment, I am confident that God is calling me to permanently commit to vocational singleness and to the Nashville Family of Brothers. On Saturday, September 30th, I'm gonna make those commitments.

How seriously should you take this? As seriously as you would any Christian marriage!

There's gonna be save the dates, formal invitations, and a registry. Complete with a bachelor party, rehearsal, and rehearsal dinner. The ceremony will include my godson, multiple clergy, a brass quintet, and organ.

All followed by a cocktail hour, catered reception in a tastefully decorated banquet tent, a jazz band, cake, and toasts. Afterward, I'll celebrate with a pilgrimage to Max Thurian's grave in Taize, France as part of a month-long vacation in Europe.

Why?

I need to receive the full gift of grace from God to do vocational singleness well. I need that 100-fold provision of family in this life and the next that Jesus promised. I need to fully commit myself to the undivided attention that vocational singleness can offer my kingdom work.

I need to fully commit myself to this family of brothers. I need them to know that I will never leave them. I need my restless mind, heart, and feet to know where I'm staying, who I'm staying with, and what work that staying will empower.

And I'm committing publicly because God created me as an embodied person. So I need ceremony—I need an embodied moment—to not only convince my mind, but to reassure my body and soul that God is really doing something.

So what can you do?

Well, first, please pray for me and the Nashville Family of Brothers!

And second, if you know any wedding planners, brass quintets, small jazz ensembles, photographers, videographers, cake bakers, caterers, tent and decoration rentals, or florists in Nashville who'd be moved by what I'm doing and interested in helping me make it happen in an *affordable* way, please message me!

This past weekend the Nashville Family of Brothers (and some guys considering joining our brotherhood) went on a spiritual retreat led by NFOB's Pastoral Advisory Board.

We spent 48 hours together in a beautiful lake house sharing meals, play card games, learning from pastors about discernment, praying, worshipping, and daring each other to jump into the cold winter lake.

I loaded a whole half-rick of firewood in the back of my 4Runner and spent multiple hours sitting next to the wood-burning fireplace we had going for most waking hours.

But the highlight of the retreat was a time of fasting, silence, and alone time with God that lasted most of Saturday.

My take-away? I spend plenty of time future-tripping on fear. And some amount of fear is healthy. In a broken world, there are real risk involved in NFOB, Equip, my counseling practice, public discipleship efforts, and my involvement in the ACNA.

But if I think beautiful outcomes are just as likely as painful outcomes in each of those areas of my life (which I do), then why don't I spend just as much time and energy future-tripping on hope!?

The obvious answer is that fear comes naturally, but hope takes intention. Still, my brain can agree that beautiful outcomes are just as likely, so it's not foolish to spend just as much time dreaming about what the future could be, and savoring those dreams.

So over the next few months, I'm going to try to be intentional about future-tripping on hope. I'm going to dream about the best-case scenarios for NFOB, Equip, my counseling practice, public discipleship efforts, and my involvement in the ACNA.

Oma (as we call her) was a great mother, a faithful Christian, and eager to join Jesus in paradise as her health deteriorated over the past few months. 

At our Ash Wednesday service earlier in the week, we were reminded of a central theme of Lent: From dust we came, and to dust we shall return.

When I got the text on Sat that Oma died, I couldn't shake those words: From dust we came, and to dust we shall return.

Evangelicals over-emphasized ""just get to Heaven"" for decades, neglecting that Jesus ALSO called us to seek fullness of life for ourselves and our neighbors on this side of heaven.

But the key word is ""also"".

The materialism of the West is, in part, designed by the Enemy to distract us from death. We approach the hard reality that we will die and God (if He exists) will decide our fate, but then the Enemy draws us away with romance, social media outrage, & self-realization.

The Enemy hopes to entertain us until the day we die, keeping us from ever having to face reality.

These days, the pendulum has swung the opposite direction. Some Christians eagerly teach about fullness of life today, but they hesitate to teach about eternal life tomorrow: ""It's not polite to press people to think about death and where they will spend forever.""

""They seem entertained. It wouldn't be nice to disturb them.""

From dust we came, and to dust we shall return.

Don't get me wrong, how we care for this world matters (because it will continue into the next life) and how we care for our neighbors matters (because the Scriptures say that Christians' love for each other + those on the margins is what will convert).

But we can only make the most of life today and have the most life tomorrow if we face death.

Here's some hard reality questions that we all need to ask, including me:

What if there's a God, and that God isn't who I want Him to be?
Is there anything the Enemy has been enabling me to avoid, but I need to face?
What would happen if I died today?
Am I willing to receive God's grace and allow it to more fully re-prioritize my life?

So if same-sex attractions are broken and God didn’t intend for anyone to be gay, yet God allowed that brokenness to develop and rarely heals that brokenness when people ask God for healing, how is that fair?

At the core of that question is the timeless question: Why do bad things happen to seemingly innocent people?

Well, in order for us to have real choice and true agency to choose to love God and other people, God usually lets the consequences of our decisions play out. That’s the theological concept of free process.

If God stepped in every time and protected each of us from the consequences of the sins of others, would their choices have been real choices?

No. So in order for our love for God and each other to mean something, God chooses the greater good of allowing things to play out.

How does that apply to broken sexuality?

I believe that I developed same-sex attractions because of the decisions of others. Some see broken genetics as a manifestation of generational sin going all the way back to Adam and Even.

Maybe there was some kind of brokenness in the home and community I grew up in that contributed. To be clear, scientists don't know specifically what factors from a person's upbringing contribute.

But then to protect my free will, God chose not to swoop in and prevent me from developing same-sex attractions by blocking the consequences of the decisions of others.

Thankfully, as Romans 8:28 promises, God has been faithful to redeem my enduring brokenness for His glory and my good.

It’s been particularly through submitting my brokenness to God and faithfully stewarding my sexuality that I’ve experienced the most purpose and belonging in my life.

I often get asked whether I think God meant for me to be gay. I think Gay Christians ask me this because they're often wondering what to do with the warnings against gay sex in Scripture.

If God meant for me to be gay, then it'd be cruel for him to keep me from a loving, monogamous relationship with someone I was made to love, right?! But here's the thing, I don't think God meant for me to be gay.

The consensus of queer secular scientists is that we're not born gay, but instead develop our sexual orientations through a mix of genetics and contributions from our upbringing.

But even if I was born gay, that wouldn't tell me about God's intentions. None of us are how God intended.

All of us were corrupted at a genetic level, formed imperfectly in our mother's womb, and were born into a fallen world that injured us countless times before we developed true agency.

So God's intentions aren't a scientific question. They're a theological question. So what does the Bible say?

Well, that's a complicated question that would take hours to unpack adequately, but, in a few words, Romans 1 teaches that same-sex sexual desires are broken and contrary to God’s first intentions.

God did’t intend for anyone to experience same-sex attraction or to engage in same-sex romantic or sexual relationships.

Yet, I'm clearly gay, so at the very least, God allowed this brokenness to develop, right?

But then if same-sex attractions are broken, if God didn’t intend for anyone to be gay, yet God allowed that brokenness to develop and rarely heals that brokenness when people ask God for healing, how is that fair?

Stay tuned for my next video for the answer to that question.

I recently went on the Adventures in Theology podcast with Brayden Brookshier to talk about vocational singleness, including how God called me to vocational singleness.

By the end of college I had experienced multiple long periods of singleness and studied Jesus & Paul's words about lifetime singleness for the sake of the kingdom.

While I was out to most people in my life, I also ended up dating a couple of women, uniquely falling in love with them, and almost got engaged. So despite my sexuality, I knew that Christian marriage could work for me.

But the Holy Spirit made clear to me that I wasn't supposed to go take the gift I preferred. Instead I was supposed to ask, ""God, do you have a preference for whether I pursue vocational singleness or Christian marriage?""

I wasn't aware of it, but over the next three years, God led me through a process of discernment:

I dug deeper into historic theology of vocational singleness and Christian marriage. I met with my therapist and mentors to make sense of my fears around both singleness and marriage.

I read ""God's Voice Within"" by Mark Thibodeaux to develop my capacity for general Christian discernment.

I gained clarity about the kingdom work I was called to and increasing peace about passing on the work of raising kids to give myself fully to the work of Equip, being a therapist, and public discipleship around vocational singleness.

But there was still one thing missing: family.

By 2017 I felt called to vocational singleness, but I also knew I didn't have a magical gift of celibacy such that I didn’t need human family. So I asked the late Fr. Thomas Mckenzie, “How can I find the family in the body of Christ that I need at our church?”

Here’s how he responded:

“To be honest, I don’t think you’re going to find the kind of family you need at our church or any church in Nashville any time soon. But monasticism has been the most common way celibate people have found family.

It’s been the greatest source of evangelism in the Church, the greatest source of theology in the Church, and the greatest source of social justice in the Church...[con't in comments]",0,"02/16/2023 09:24",https://www.instagram.com/p/Cou0c3XrWnN/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,407,268,0,18,61,

I'm not anti-romance. I'm not anti-marriage. I'm not anti-love.

I just care deeply for a lot of people who seem to be chasing false hope of what romance could provide, leading to loneliness, self-medicating of all kinds, broken relationships, lack of purpose, and a scarcity of money + time.

So many people I love seem to believe that if they could just fall in love with the right person, many of their problems would melt away.

When they look at other people who seem to have it all, they assume that those marriages are easy because the spouses are such a good fit, and they assume the couple has (for the most part) escaped loneliness.

For a season, they believe God will bring ""the one"" into their life. But after waiting for awhile, they slowly adopt the beliefs of the romance economy: ""If you were more attractive, more wealthy, more cultured, and spent enough money on enough magical dates, you'd find 'the one.'""

So they go on diets, get gym memberships, put in 75-hr work weeks to get promotions, force themselves to read books and articles they don't care about, and spend thousands of dollars &dozens of date nights hoping.

Many quit in exhaustion.

Others get married, only to discover that, while marriage is beautiful, nothing comes easy. Every best thing must be fought for and maintained. New forms of loneliness replace old ones.

Regardless of whether they end up single or married, the romance economy wins. Human businesses are enriched. The Enemy revels in the years wasted.

Again, I'm not categorically against romance, marriage, or love. They are beautiful gifts from God. But too many people are tricked into chasing false hope when they think they're seeking God's good gifts.

So what can Christians do?

It starts by noticing the idol of romance. Noticing its false promises in our hearts. Noticing the devastation it's caused.

And then we can get busy doing something about it. I think right-sizing our expectations of marriage, raising our expectations of friendship, investing in thicker family in the body of Christ, and offering greater support for vocational singleness would go a long way...[con't in comments]",0,"02/14/2023 07:00",https://www.instagram.com/p/CopaWWhu0El/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,448,494,3,14,94,

Here are the arguments many find compelling about progressive / revisionist / liberal sexual ethics:

1. Jesus didn’t talk about gay sex (so let people decide for themselves what's sinful)

2. The Bible doesn't talk about gay people (so the Bible doesn't have any wisdom for gay sexual ethics)

3. Christians were wrong about slavery and women (so Christians have been wrong about historic sexual ethics)

4. God makes people gay (so God must bless monogamous same-sex unions)

5. Sexual orientation doesn't change (so God must want people to be gay)

6. Lifetime abstinence is unrealistic (so everyone needs an outlet for God-blessed sex)

7. Mixed-orientation marriages have often failed (so they should never be tried)

8. Historic sexual ethics has led to loneliness and pain (so it must be false)

9. A loving God wouldn’t deny His children a loving marriage (so churches must bless same-sex unions to be loving)

I'll be honest, when I dig into the case for each of these, I don't find any of them convincing.

Unfortunately, many straight Christians assume that every gay person is a sex addict. When gay Christians ask pastors for help, they're automatically referred to a sex addiction support group.

Not only is this assumption offensive, but it rarely addresses a gay person's core challenge. Hooking up, looking at porn, and/or masturbating are rarely the central issue. Gay peoples' greatest needs are family in the body of Christ and healing of their wounds of the closet.

When leaders assume gay sex addiction is the primary issue, pastoral care hyper-focuses on sexual sin. The gay person's belief that God loves them rises and falls with a pastor's praises of sobriety and frownings at failure.

Are some gay people sex addicts? Sure. But that's not because they're inherently more likely to be sex addicts. The genetic vulnerabilities to sex addiction don't travel with the gay genes like some cruel 2-for-1 special. 

Some gay people are sex addicts because the closet is the perfect breeding ground for pain and addiction.

Many grew up hearing that gay people were dirty and disgusting, so when they realized they experienced same-sex attractions, they ran into the proverbial closet to hide from loved ones who might hurt them.

Alone in the closet, the Enemy tortured them with fear, shame, depression, and isolation. If they got too close to friends, they might develop a crush or accidentally out themselves, so they settled for shallow friendship.

For many trapped in a lonely closet, lust and pornography seemed like the only way escape pain and connect with something. That perfect storm taught too many gay people to repeatedly medicate their pain with something sexual.

But not because gay people are inherently more likely to be sex addicts. Instead because the Church failed to offer God's love and wisdom to gay people, instead shoving them into the closet and into the arms of the Enemy where lust felt like the only way survive another day.

At a recent campus minister training, I urged them not to bring up gay sex ethics with students until they first covered God's wisdom for everyone's sexual stewardship (and addressed ways straight Christians often fall short).

Why? Consistency and effectiveness.

When we start with gay sin (or only talk about gay sin), that's reasonably seen as targeting. It perpetuates a double standard and empowers a destructive victim mentality in gay people.

But if you first call straight people to a historic sexual ethic...

(by tackling the pornography epidemic, challenging straight people to consider lifetime vocational singleness, ensuring Christian marriages are open to raising children for the kingdom, and applying the Bible's wisdom about divorce/remarriage)

...then it doesn't seem unreasonable or targeting to then invite gay people to steward their sexualities in culturally inconvenient ways—not to make everyone's life difficult, but because God's wisdom is ultimately life-giving for everyone.

Second, we've got to first talk about straight sex ethics because the solutions for better straight sexual stewardship are also the solutions for better gay sexual stewardship.

Gay Christians don't need special solutions. Gay Christians will thrive best in churches that are taking everyone's sexual stewardship seriously by
resisting romance idolatry and lust,
leading everyone to discern between vocational singleness and Christian marriage,
valuing a meaningful minority of Christians committed to vocational singleness,
cultivating intentional Christian community where vocational singles could find lifelong family, and
helping Christian marriages thrive and faithfully sacrifice for the kingdom.

The only extra step churches need to take for gay people is making sure parents share with every kid about God's love and wisdom for gay people before puberty in age-appropriate ways so that no kid ever has to suffer in the closet.

So if your church has been avoiding conversation about sexual ethics, but you know you need to get started, start with talking about sexual stewardship for all people.

For nearly a decade I was burdened by crushing shame, in large part because I was told gay sexual sin was worse than straight sexual sin.

Sometimes explicitly (but often indirectly) I was led to believe that whatever sins I committed, they were even more despicable in God's eyes because I was gay.

It was worse to look at gay porn than straight porn.

If a guy got handsy with his girlfriend in college, mentors slapped him on the wrist but quipped, ""Well, you're in your 20s. At least you didn't have sex.""

If, in a time of weakness, I got handsy with a guy, mentors treated me like I had committed adultery and put me on 6-months leave from Christian leadership.

Eventually, I was able to give this double standard a name: homophobia.

But thankfully, wiser mentors and caring therapists helped me route out homophobic shame. How?

First, they encouraged me to share my story with safe people. Each time someone responded with compassion and a genuine desire to get to know me better, it was easier to believe that I was just as worthy of love.

Second, mentors helped me identity moments of past sexual sin when I experienced crushing levels of self-destructive shame on top of appropriate levels of guilt. I imagined going back in time and caring for my younger self by disentangling appropriate guilt from destructive shame.

Third, I gave myself permission to listen to music and watch movies where gay characters were portrayed as normal (while avoiding any romantic/sexual content that would be unhelpful for me).

I recently went on the Things You Don't Hear In Church Podcast to talk about faith and sexuality. One of the questions we explored was whether God intends for people to experience same-sex attraction.

Even queer secular scientists recognize that no one is born gay. We all develop our sexual orientations from a mix of genetics and relational upbringing. But even if we were born gay, that doesn't tell us about God's intentions.

None of us are how God intended. All of us were corrupted at a genetic level, formed imperfectly in our mother's womb, and were born into a fallen world that injured us countless times before we developed true agency.

God's intentions aren't a scientific question. They're a theological question. So what does the Bible say?

As I've explored at length in Equip's ""Responding to Convincing Arguments for Revisionist Sexual Ethics"" (link in bio), Romans 1 teaches that same-sex sexual desires are ""unnatural""; they are broken and contrary to God’s first intentions.

God did’t intend for anyone to experience same-sex attraction or to engage in same-sex romantic or sexual relationships. Yet, some of us have clearly developed same-sex attractions, so at the very least, God allowed this brokenness to develop.

But if same-sex attractions are broken, God didn’t intend for anyone to be gay, yet God allowed that brokenness to develop and rarely heals that brokenness when people ask God for healing, how is that fair?

At the core of that question is the timeless question: Why do bad things happen to seemingly innocent people?

People don’t choose their sexual orientation, and gay people haven’t done anything to bring about their sexual orientation—they’re innocent in that way. So why?

Well, in order for us to have real choice and true agency to choose to love God and other people, God usually lets the consequences of our decisions play out. That’s the theological concept of free process.

If God stepped in every time and protected each of us from the consequences of the sins of others, would their choices have been real choices? No.

The gospel is about more than saving souls—it's about redeeming all of creation! And Jesus didn't tell us to just wait for his return to start making things better.

God sent us the Holy Spirit to get busy today bringing for Christ's kingdom today!

Yet many believers offer timid testimonies about the gospel’s transforming power. They struggle with disappointment and hopelessness for themselves and those they love. Christ's promises seem to ring hollow, the kingdom is coming too slowly, the gospel feels feeble.

When too few of God's people are willing to faithfully collaborate with Him to bring forth the New Heavens and New Earth, it can look like God seems willing to let things fall apart.

Thankfully a potent vehicle of kingdom work and kingdom hope for the early Church is available to God's people today, if we will only embrace and nourish it.

Amid Christ's ministry on earth, he instituted a vocation meant to give us hope for the kingdom to come and to bring forth that kingdom with undivided attention: the vocation of singleness.

Jesus intended for vocational singles to use the time and energy they would otherwise use to raise kids to instead heal our communities with single-minded focus. Imagine a meaningful minority of celibate Christians serving as teachers in low-income neighborhoods, pregnancy resource center workers, nurses at free clinics, advocates for refugees, and mental health therapists with undivided attention.

Christ's institution of vocational singleness isn't incidental to the gospel. It's a cornerstone.

A renewed teaching and practice of vocational singleness won't complete the work of bringing forth the kingdom of Jesus. Only Christ's return can accomplish that. But in the meantime, we can reinvigorate this cornerstone of the gospel, bring the good news alive for those curious about Jesus, and draw people to Him.

At a public theology seminar hosted by the Charleston Anglican Cathedral Church, I got to encourage non-Christian college students to trade their hookup apps for more friendship and more public service:

""While Jesus was on earth, he made the radical suggestion that some should choose never to marry. He suggested they take all of the time+energy they'd spend on a spouse+kids and instead use their availability to address things like
wealth inequality,
racial division,
homelessness,
mental illness, and a
lack of care for immigrants and refugees.

In another conversation, Jesus said that actually, in the perfect, complete, made-right world that He would eventually bring, we will all be celibate.

We will all give up romance and sex because the belonging and friendship we will enjoy in this new place will be better than any romance or sex we've ever had.

And Jesus suggested that some of His followers should give up romance and sex now, spending their lives caring for others and enjoying belonging in His family without the need for exclusivity or romance *IN ORDER TO* give people a preview of the made-right world to come.

I think that 1st century Jewish carpenter named Jesus was onto something. Regardless of whether you're a Christian or not, would you give His advice a chance? What if for a season, you set aside romance and sex?

What if you focused on cultivating multiple friendships instead of investing in just one lover, and what if you learned how to feel just as connected and cared for by others without hookups?

What if instead of spending so much time and energy trying to look like the most desirable person

I turn 32 on Saturday, January 7th. NYE and my birthday bookend a time of reflection and looking forward. I've been thinking a lot recently about whether I love God.

What does it even mean to ""love God""?

Is it like when my mom is hurting/sad and some deepest part of my soul is profoundly unsettled (on her behalf) until things are made right?

Is it like how proud I am to be my dad's son and the ways he's been a just employer + helped people bring the beauty of God's creation to their yards?

Is it like the immediate delight I feel when my little brother and I hang out in person after months apart because years of consistent mutual care gives us confidence that we love each other?

Is it like my desire to discover and be enchanted by the ways each of my NFOB brothers uniquely images God because of their willingness to commit to family with me (and others)?

I used to think I was supposed to feel those ways toward God. To love God in the same ways I love humans I've seen and hugged. But I never did. And then I drowned in shame.

Awhile back I asked the late Fr. Thomas Mckenzie what it meant to love God:

""Well, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit are not human. God the Son is not bodily with us on this planet. So all of those anthropomorphic aspirations of loving God might not be realistic.""

He continued, ""Historically, the Church has offered a different vision: love God by loving His people, obeying His wisdom, and building His kingdom.""

""I can do that,"" I said.

So if you raise a glass or offer a prayer on my behalf this season, pray that God would help me let go of unrealistic, shame-bringing expectations of loving Him.

And pray with me that God would help me better love His people, obey His wisdom, and build His kingdom.

Pray that I'd learn how to love Him better.",0,"01/06/2023 09:04",https://www.instagram.com/p/CnFNhzZuax5/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,185,578,0,49,75,

Okay, this might be my favorite quote. It's from G. K. Chesterton. He said, ""Whenever monks come back, marriages will come back.""

He's lamenting that too few Christians are committing to kingdom singleness, and too few Christians are faithfully walking out Christian marriage. But he didn't see these vocations as competing in a zero-sum game.

Instead, he suggested that robust teaching and practice of vocational singleness was the key to healthier Christian marriage.

When Christians default to marriage, they take it for granted. They fail to humbly approach Christian marriage as a gift from God and a calling to sacrificial kingdom work. Instead they see it as an ordinary entitlement.

But Chesterton imagined a Church where every Christian discerned between both vocational singleness and Christian marriage, more committed to vocational singleness, and more faithfully stewarded Christian marriage.

Since Chesterton's death, less than 1% of Christians have committed to vocational singleness and marriage rates have dropped by 60%. The Church failed to heed his wisdom, and churches struggle to care for an increasing number in uncommitted singleness.

Clearly attempts to boost Christian marriage by ignoring biblical teaching on divorce and remarriage, capitulating to the Sexual Revolution's decoupling of sex and child-rearing, tolerating casual Christian romance, and promising fairy-tale weddings accompanied by life-changing sex (as long as you're a virgin) DIDN'T work.

What if we took Chesterton's advice this time? What if we started by teaching what Jesus and Paul actually had to say about vocational singleness? 

What if we celebrated and valued vocational singles in our churches and families? And what if we invited people to discern and helped vocational singles make family in intentional Christian communities?
