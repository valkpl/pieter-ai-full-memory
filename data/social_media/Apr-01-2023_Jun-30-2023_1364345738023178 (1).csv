Over the past year, Equip has partnered with Jesse White, a seminary-trained Christian leader who has been faithfully stewarding his own gender incongruence. Together, we’ve developed a brand-new resource to help pastors and Christians navigate this conversation in their communities:

Equip's new Gender Incongruence Course is a 4-session resource that (1) helps Christian leaders and parents think empathetically and theologically about gender incongruence and (2) equips Christian leaders and parents to offer God’s love and wisdom to trans* people.

The Course includes the stories of trans* people, a survey of relevant Bible passages, answers to key theological questions, and practical advice for caring for those navigating gender incongruence in your families and churches.

Over the next 8 weeks, learn about gender incongruence with Equip and help others learn in three ways:

1. WATCH: Get on-demand access to Equip’s Gender Incongruence Course today for just $50. On your own or in a group, you can watch all course sessions led by Jesse, reflect and discuss using course handouts, and review what you’ve learned with detailed notes. 

2. READ: Not ready to jump in just yet? Read samples of “Understanding Gender Incongruence & Caring for Trans* People” on Equip’s Blog, including articles about pronouns and name changes, who trans* people are in God’s eye, and suicide prevention.

3. SCHOLARSHIP: Help us raise $8,000 to provide parents-in-need with scholarship access to Equip’s Gender Incongruence Course and reach more churches in 2023. Your support ensures money is never a barrier to parents and pastors getting the resources they need.

Over the past few years, I've gotten in the habit of choosing to work 70 hours a week and neglecting my family of brothers and people from my church who I've committed to love.

More than a year ago, the board of Equip and I began planning for me to take another sabbatical. Rest assured, this isn't the result of some critical moral failure or a sabbatical-before-quitting.

We just want to make sure I'm taking preventative steps to ensure I can faithfully labor for the sake of the kingdom for decades to come.

To help with this, over the next two months, I'm getting off of social media, bumping my counseling clients to August, taking a break from the work of Equip, and generally avoiding productivity and intensity.

My hope is to rediscover the value of slow, unplanned, ordinary time with the people I love. To that end, I'll mostly spend the next two months in Nashville, hanging out with my people.

Starting June 1st, please pray for my sabbatical, that I would hold these boundaries and lean into any discomfort that comes up.

Pray that I would meet the Lord in unhurried time with my family of brothers, visits to the zoo with my godson, laid-back dinners with brothers and sisters in Christ, and leisurely walks in the sun.

See you in August!

I recently went on the Good Christian Co. Podcast with Robby Ortiz and Joshua Delp to talk about faith and sexuality.

At one point, they asked me how to navigate conversations where people disagree about the morality of gay marriage and gay sex.

My solution: Don't talk about sexual ethics.

Instead, talk about more fundamental theological questions.

Most of the time, if I've come to a different conclusion than someone else regarding sexual ethics, it's merely a downstream result of disagreement on one of three much more important theological questions:

1. Is there a God?
2. Does that God know what's best for me better than I do?
3. Do we discover that God's best for us by reading the Bible with the historic Church?

Two people seldom answer ""yes"" to all three of those questions yet hold meaningfully different opinions about sexual ethics.

So if you do disagree, avoid emotionally-loaded and seemingly high-stakes conversation about sexual ethics.

Instead, talk about whether there's a God, whether that God know's what's best, and how we discover what that God's best is!

Jesus intended vocational singles to live ""for the sake of the kingdom"" by reinvesting the time and energy they would have used to raise kids to instead do even more non-child-raising kingdom work.

50% more.

Let me explain.

According to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics and a bit of back-of-napkin math, the average parent spends the equivalent of two decades of 40-hour work weeks raising children.

Between the ages 25 and 65, that’s nearly a third of their total capacity for kingdom work dedicated to the important kingdom work of raising children—but therefore unavailable for other kingdom work.

The average parent also has to earn twice as much as a single person to provide for a nuclear family.

Yet teachers in low-income neighborhoods, pregnancy resource center workers, nurses at free clinics, advocates for refugees, and mental health therapists are often the most underpaid.

Parents often cannot afford to take the jobs directly addressing the plentiful harvest of brokenness.

That's why Jesus established vocational singleness!

—to make a meaningful minority of Christians available to take that third of kingdom work capacity and leverage it for something other than raising children.

Jesus hoped for a powerful minority of Christians having 50% more time and energy than parents to heal our communities with undivided attention.

To be clear, I'm not saying that parents can't do kingdom work other than raising children. And raising children is *essential* kingdom work.

At the same time, I consistently hear from parents that, after 8 hours at a job to put food on the table and 4 hours of after-school parenting, they feel like they don't have much to give other kingdom work endeavors.

What if instead of shaming parents for not doing it all, we instead honored their kingdom work of raising children and simultaneously supported single Christians to leverage their availability for the sake of kingdom work with undivided attention?!

When my grandmother recently died, I was reminded of a central theme of Lent: From dust we came, and to dust we shall return.

Evangelicals over-emphasized ""just get to Heaven"" for decades, neglecting that Jesus ALSO called us to seek fullness of life for ourselves and our neighbors on this side of heaven. But the key word is ""also"".

The materialism of the West is, in part, designed by the Enemy to distract us from death. We approach the hard reality that we will die and God (if He exists) will decide our fate, but then the Enemy draws us away with romance, social media outrage, & self-realization.

The Enemy hopes to entertain us until the day we die, keeping us from ever having to face reality. These days, the pendulum has swung the opposite direction.

Some Christians eagerly teach about fullness of life today, but they hesitate to teach about eternal life tomorrow: ""It's not polite to press people to think about death and where they will spend forever. They seem entertained. It wouldn't be nice to disturb them.""

Don't get me wrong, how we care for this world matters (because it will continue into the next life) and how we care for our neighbors matters (because the Scriptures say that Christians' love for each other + those on the margins is what will convert).

But we can only make the most of life today and have the most life tomorrow if we face death.

Here's some hard reality questions that we all need to ask, including me:
What if there's a God, and that God isn't who I want Him to be?
Is there anything the Enemy has been enabling me to avoid, but I need to face?
What would happen if I died today?
Am I willing to receive God's grace and allow it to more fully re-prioritize my life?

Some claim that ""better to marry than to burn"" in 1 Corinthians 7:9 means that people who find abstinence challenging are automatically called to marriage.

That's a common misinterpretation that has particularly hurt mothers and children.

Pastors have used 1 Cor 7:9 to encourage people (particularly men) struggling with sexual purity to get married as a way to contain their sexual temptations.

But instead of fixing the problem, using ""marriage as a remedy for weakness"" just multiplies the number of people impacted by the lack of self-control, leading to infidelity, divorce, and destroyed lives.

To put it bluntly, if you continue to struggle mightily with sexual immorality after months of genuine effort, then you need sex addiction recovery, not marriage.

Every Christian, regardless of calling, can and must learn to discipline their sexual desires. Fiancés should not settle for less.

If ""marriage as a remedy for weakness"" wasn't Paul's intended message in 1 Cor 7:9, then what was?

Rigorous scholarship reveals that Paul was instead narrowly addressing a group of Corinthian Christians who had adopted strange Gnostic beliefs that their bodies didn't matter, so they were claiming to be ""celibate in spirit"" while engaging in unrestrained sexual immorality.

Paul was chastising people who claimed to be celibate but weren't earnestly trying to be celibate.

Regardless, we are right to read 1 Cor 7:9 as a caution against publicly committing to vocational singleness unless we have the gift from God to do it well.

But Jesus said the same about Christian marriage in Matthew 19:11: don't commit to Christian marriage unless you have the gift from God to do it well.

To thrive in either vocation, we must receive the gift from God to do that vocation well.

How do we figure out whether God wants to give us the gift of vocational singleness or Christian marriage? How do we put ourselves in a place where we can step into and receive that gift?

Discernment!

By the end of college I'd experienced long periods of singleness and studied Jesus and Paul's words about vocational singleness. While I was out to a lot of people, I also ended up dating a couple of women, uniquely falling in love with them, and almost got engaged.

So despite my sexuality, I knew that Christian marriage could work for me. But the Holy Spirit made clear to me that I wasn't supposed to go take the gift I preferred.

Instead I was supposed to ask, ""God, do you have a preference for whether I pursue vocational singleness or Christian marriage?""

Then, unbeknownst to me, God led me through a time-tested process of discernment: I dug deeper into historic theology of vocational singleness and Christian marriage.

I met with my therapist and mentors to make sense of my fears around both vocations. I read ""God's Voice Within"" by Mark Thibodeaux to develop my capacity for general Christian discernment.

I gained clarity about the kingdom work I was called to and increasing peace about passing on the work of raising kids to give myself fully to the work of Equip, being a therapist, and public discipleship around vocational singleness.

I started building the Nashville Family of Brothers as a place where I could find lifelong, lived-in family.

And I made 1-year and then 3-year commitments to my singleness and my intentional Christian community to seek confirmation from the Lord for my callings (all covered by the prayer and wisdom of mentors).

Are you single? Are you willing to ask God whether He has a preference for you? What's the first step you could take in your discernment?

17966472119240501,17841415038692451,pieterlvalk,"Pieter L Valk, LPC","Yes, married people can lust after their own spouse.

I recently went on the Goodlion Podcast to explore a variety of questions in the intersection of faith and sexuality, including the different ways broken sexuality shows up in our world.

Christians may be quick to point to the broken reality of same-sex attractions, but everyone's sexuality is broken. Straight people lust after people they aren't married to. Married Christians can even lust after their own spouse.

Let me explain.

We lust when we sexually objectify someone in order to consume/use them (or their image) in selfish ways. This is most obvious in marriages where there is any sexual, physical, or emotional abuse occurring.

But married people share with me that sometimes, when they're not doing well, they look at their spouse in the same ways as they look at people in pornography: They want to use their spouse to make themselves feel better. And then they do so.

That's just as much a sin as watching pornography. That's just as much a sin as a Christian lusting after someone of the same sex.

To be clear, just because lust is *part* of someone's motivations doesn't mean it's the entirety of their motivations. Most of the time, desire is a mix of motivations, some broken and some holy.

But most of the time, lust is at least a small part of marital desire. Does this mean that married Christians should cease all marital intimacy with each other because there's a possibility of lust? No.

It just means that, like friendship outside of marriage, connection inside of marriage can't be pursued unthinkingly. There is no context where Christians can enjoy and take from each others' bodies unthinkingly.

In every relationship, we must ask ourselves, ""Am I connecting with this person with motivations of self-giving love and to communicate my care to them? Am I selfishly taking from them? Am I objectifying them?""

We need to ask these questions in marriage, in dating relationships, and in friendships. Everyone needs to pause and examine their motivations.

When gay Christians committed to historic sexual ethics seek to meet their intimacy needs in healthy ways, is it complicated?...[con't in comments]",0,"05/03/2023 09:26",https://www.instagram.com/p/CryaPG-Lyy5/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,5182,304,39,43,95,1
18220750495169055,17841415038692451,pieterlvalk,"Pieter L Valk, LPC","Discernment is the solution to kingdom work shame and inefficacy

Social media, churches, parents, mentors, and friends unintentionally—and sometimes intentionally—set up expectations that Christians must do and have it all.

Christian marrieds raising kids are burdened by expectations to display the gospel with their marriage, raise their kids to embrace the gospel, fund the gospel through their job, and somehow find time and energy to address every social injustice and moral liability in our world in a way that preaches the gospel.

Single Christians experience similar expectations, but exchange marriage and children for a lack of support and second-class status in their churches. 

Many Christians feel an obligation to effectively multitask a dozen kingdom work opportunities. Yet kingdom work multitasking is ineffective (as with any multitasking), leading to shame.

Instead, Christians are actually called *not* to have it all and called *not* to do it all. Accepting our specific, short list of kingdom work callings is the key to contentment for the individual and kingdom building in the community.

But how do we know what kingdom work we're called to? Discernment.

First, Christians have historically understood the Scriptures to teach that God calls a meaningful number of people to Christian marriage, recognizing that being a faithful spouse and a loving parent is a full-time job.

Christian parents have been encouraged to see the work of raising their kids as important kingdom work. While parents can certainly serve the kingdom in additional ways, God wants to unburden Christian parents from the expectation of doing it all.

Second, the Church simultaneously taught that God calls a meaningful minority of Christians not to marry or have kids.

Rather, these Christians are meant to use the time and energy they would have devoted to children to instead address other kingdom work that requires undivided attention.

And third, Christians have historically understood that instead of choosing between Christian marriage and vocational singleness for ourselves (and anxiously second-guessing whether we choose rightly), we're supposed to ask God...[con't in comments]",0,"05/01/2023 09:29",https://www.instagram.com/p/CrtRAJGLfOC/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,2258,134,11,2,22,

That's why Christians need a gift from God to do either vocational singleness or Christian marriage well (and why it's important to discern so we can discover which gift God wants to give).

I recently taught Encounter Young Adults in Hay, KS about Christ's invitation for every Christian to consider vocational singleness.

When I mention that every Christian young adult should open-handedly discern between vocational singleness and Christian marriage, invariably someone objects, ""But singleness is too difficult and isn't natural!""

I'd argue that Christian marriage and vocational singleness are actually equally unnatural.

Does the average Christian automatically possess everything they need to thrive in vocational singleness? No.

But the same is true of Christian marriage.

We don’t inherently have what we need to do marriage well either.

You see, in light of the Fall, romance, sex, and polyamory are what come naturally to us. Neither faithful celibacy nor faithful monogamy come naturally to us in a broken world.

Each of us has the same inherent but incomplete capacity for both vocational singleness and Christian marriage.

To do either well, we must step into that vocation and receive an additional gift to do it well.

That's also why it's so important for us to discern: so that we can discover which gift God says will be better for each of us individually, and then receive the gift God wants to give us.

So many people I love seem to believe that if they could just fall in love with the right person, many of their problems would melt away.

When they look at other people who seem to have it all, they assume that those marriages are easy because the spouses are such a good fit, and they assume the couple has (for the most part) escaped loneliness.

For a season, they believe God will bring ""the one"" into their life.

But after waiting for awhile, they slowly adopt the beliefs of the romance economy: ""If you were more attractive, more wealthy, more cultured, and spent enough money on enough magical dates, you'd find 'the one.'""

So they go on diets, get gym memberships, put in 75-hr work weeks to get promotions, force themselves to read books and articles they don't care about, and spend thousands of dollars and dozens of date nights hoping.

Many quit in exhaustion.

Others get married, only to discover that, while marriage is beautiful, nothing comes easy. Every best thing must be fought for and maintained. New forms of loneliness replace old ones.

Regardless of whether they end up single or married, the romance economy wins.

Human businesses are enriched. The Enemy gloats about the years wasted. Too many people are tricked into chasing false hope when they think they're seeking God's good gifts.

So what can Christians do?

Notice the idol of romance, its false promises in our hearts, the devastation it's caused. And then right-size your expectations of marriage, raise your expectations of friendship, invest in thicker family in the body of Christ, and offer greater support for vocational singleness.

During a recent Ask Me Anything, someone asked me how I refrain from gay sex and gay pornography.

As I've shared consistently on this platform and when I speak publicly, I am not perfect. Years ago I struggled mightily with sexual addiction, and while I have experienced significant progress over the past five years, I am still a sinner in desperate need of a savior.

But we are not without hope.

For years, my greatest weakness to both sinful sexual behavior and porn was my phone. I declared that I would read my bible and pray more, hoping those would give me more strength to resist temptation.

But eventually, I looked at porn again or downloaded a dating app.

As I've shared in a previous post, the closet was the perfect breeding ground for many gay people to develop addictions of all kinds, not because we are inherently more likely to be addicts, but because lust was sometimes the only thing we had to numb the pain of the closet.

For addicts like me, more bible study, more prayer, and more willpower just won't cut it. Not because I don't believe God could give me the power to resist, but because those solutions rarely work for addicts, even when they earnestly pursue spiritual solutions.

Many have found recovery spaces to be helpful. I did, for a season.

But the single most effective step I've taken to get back some sexual sobriety has to admit that the temptations from my phone are too powerful for me, and then to ask a friend to add restrictions/software to eliminate the option altogether.

Believe me, I've heard every excuse not to lock down one's devices. I've said them all myself.

But nothing else has worked. Nothing.

Yet thanks to locking down my phone and computer, I've experience greater sobriety over the past five years than any other times in my adult life.

Do I still make mistakes? Sure. The expectation I've set for myself is progress not perfection.

Hooking up, looking at porn, and/or masturbating are rarely the core problem. Gay peoples' greatest needs are family in the body of Christ and healing of their wounds of the closet.

But when Christian leaders assume gay sex addiction is the primary issue, the gay person's belief that God loves them rises and falls with a pastor's praises of sobriety and frownings at failure.

Are some gay people sex addicts? Sure.

But that's not because they're inherently more likely to be sex addicts. The genetic vulnerabilities to sex addiction don't travel with the gay genes like some cruel 2-for-1 special.

It's because the closet is the perfect breeding ground for pain and addiction. For years the Enemy tortured us with fear, shame, depression, and isolation. We kept our friends at a distance, afraid to develop a crush or accidentally out ourselves.

Lust and pornography seemed like the only way to escape pain and connect with something. That perfect storm taught too many of us to repeatedly medicate their pain with something sexual. But not because we're inherently more likely to be sex addicts.

Instead because the Church failed to offer God's love and wisdom to gay people, instead shoving us into the closet and into the arms of the Enemy where lust felt like the only way survive another day.

If you want to do something about gay sex addiction, make sure parents at your church are sharing with their kids before puberty about God's love and wisdom for gay people in age-appropriate ways, so that adolescents share early with parents and never have to go into the closet and develop a closet addiction to numb their pain.

Straight Christian leaders, don't talk about gay sex ethics until you've first talked about God's wisdom for straight people.

Why?

Consistency and effectiveness.

When we start with gay sin (or only talk about gay sin), that's seen as targeting. It perpetuates a double standard and empowers a destructive victim mentality in gay people.

But if you first call straight people to a historic sexual ethic—around porn, considering vocational singleness, an openness to raising children in marriage, and around unbiblical divorce and remarriage—then it doesn't seem unreasonable to then invite gay people to steward their sexualities in culturally inconvenient ways.

Second, we've got to first talk about straight sex ethics because the solutions for better straight sexual stewardship are also the solutions for better gay sexual stewardship. Gay Christians don't need special solutions.

Gay Christians will thrive best in churches that help everyone resist romance idolatry and lust, guide everyone to discern between vocational singleness and Christian marriage, cultivate intentional Christian community for vocational singles,  and help Christian marriages thrive and faithfully sacrifice for the kingdom.

The only extra step churches need to take for gay people is to make sure parents share with every kid about God's love and wisdom for gay people before puberty in age-appropriate ways so that no kid ever has to suffer in the closet.

So if your church has been avoiding conversation about sexual ethics, but you know you need to get started, start with talking about sexual stewardship for straight people.

Session Three of Equip’s Gender Incongruence Course explores the following recommendations for ministering to trans people with Gods love and wisdom:

1. Adopt a general posture of empathy and compassion - God made trans people in His image, and we must treat trans people with the dignity and respect every imago dei deserves.

Take your time to build rapport with trans Christians you’re ministering to. Patiently invest in relationship to earn their trust. Don’t be surprised when walking together is at times difficult and complicated.

Commit to giving trans Christians the benefit of the doubt, and commit to being quick to re-examine your own motivations and actions when trans people you’re caring for feel hurt.

2. Prioritize addressing mental health needs - Connect trans people with proven interventions to address depression/suicidality:
- In-person talk therapy with a counselor to address grief/loss
- Regular exercise/physical activity
- Use of antidepressants
- A broader community of social support

3. Honor their lack of choice and explore options for morally neutral relief - Transgender people do not choose to experience gender incongruence. Help them resolve what they can and manage what they must.

Support trans Christians as they consider morally neutral options in the range of social transition that might provide relief from their gender incongruence. Help them weigh each possibility and carefully step forward where the Lord leads.

4. Support their acceptance of some level of brokenness and suffering - Many trans Christians will continue to experience some persisting and painful gender incongruence, even after some social transition.

Connect trans Christians with ways Christians throughout the ages have written about suffering and found a way to accept persisting brokenness. Hold space for them to be angry, sad, afraid, and numb.

5. Address childhood shame from gender stereotypes - Many trans people were judged as kids when they liked or disliked something kids of their biological sex weren't supposed to.

I don't want to answer this question for the same reasons that I don't want to respond when people ask, ""Well, Pieter, do you think gay sex is a sin?""

There are so many more important questions when it comes to embodying God's love for gay & trans people. There are so many hours of friendship + trust that must be earned before those of us who aren't trans or aren't gay have credibility to ask that question.

And yet, eventually, in some friendships and in some discipleship relationships, this question is asked. And it matters that we respond with God's love AND wisdom.

I'll be frank. I'm going to fail to answer this question adequately in 2,200 characters. I beg you, if you care about this conversation, before you judge me too harshly, please visit the link at the end of this post and skim the full article where I carefully unpack my convictions.

In the second session of Equip’s Gender Incongruence Course, we explore thirteen Bible passages often cited in conversation about gender ethics and then answer the following questions: 
1. What were God’s intentions for biological sex & gender?
2. To what extent did God prescribe gender?
3. How is gender biologically + culturally broken?
4. How can we conceptualize gender incongruence?
5. How does gender incongruence develop?
6. Was it God’s intention? Can it change?
7. Is merely experiencing gender incongruence a brokenness? A sin?

Ultimately, we conclude that God intended each of us to be a female-bodied woman or a male-bodied man, but because we live in a broken world, some experience a painful incongruence between their biological sex and felt gender.

If that's the case, then on a fundamental level, who are trans Christians? How does God see them?

Well, when an individual is not intersex and their chromosomes, gonads, sexual anatomy, & secondary sex characteristics all indicate the same biological sex, then we can discern God’s intentions for the individual’s biological sex.

Plus, when God’s intentions for an individual’s biological sex are evident, we can also discern His intentions for their experience of gender...[con't in comments]",0,"04/13/2023 09:15",https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq-5GPCO8Dw/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,870,278,1,47,128,

When believers apply biblical principles differently to different people—in ways that are stricter with minorities, observers reasonably question whether those believers' true motivations are truth or hate.

Christians who claim to hold a biblical gender ethic argue that (1) when God's intentions for a person's biological sex is clear and (2) when the person's reproductive capacities are functional, then (3) it's a rejection of God's gift—and therefore sin—to hormonally/surgically alter them.

But if that's what you believe, then what's the difference between hormonal/surgical transition for trans people versus breast enhancement, a vasectomy, or contraception?

Isn't a Christian who is against the first but allows the rest encouraging discrimination, at some level?

Fellow Christians, before you challenge a trans Christian in your life to steward their gender incongruence according to a biblical gender ethic, examine whether you are applying biblical principles consistently.

If you continue to hold different people to different standards, don't be surprised when your inconsistency is labeled as hate (instead of concern for truth) and God's wisdom is easily dismissed.

On the other hand, if you care deeply about trans people following God's wisdom, then how are you willing to invite straight, cisgender Christians to first steward their sex/gender in inconvenient but God-honoring ways?

Ohh, and a note about pushback.

As I explore more deeply in ""Certainty & Consistency in Gender Ethics"" (link in bio), we at Equip are confident that we got at least a few things wrong in our first edition of Equip's Gender Incongruence Course.

A consensus of compassionate orthodoxy on gender incongruence hasn't coalesced yet, leading many churches to be silent about God's love and wisdom for trans people. Silence hurts trans people.

Christians must do better, and the first step is accelerating the consensus-building project. That's why we at Equip attempted to answer the questions trans Christians, parents, and pastors are asking with details and specifics...[con't in comments]",0,"04/10/2023 09:28",https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq3MNW_LlVI/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,1357,345,24,110,162,16

Tragically, 41% of trans people attempt suicide, as compared to 1.6% of the general population.

Trans suicide rates are even higher for those who lose a job due to bias (55%), are harassed/bullied in school (51%), have a low household income (61%), are the victim of physical assault (61%), or are the victim of sexual assault (65%).

Trans people were made in the image of God and God highly values them. Yet the brokenness of this world has cruelly convinced many trans people that they aren't worth loving and that their precious life isn't worth living.

Different extremes in the debate about gender incongruence offer trans people equally unhelpful advice:

One side yells, “Just be normal!” They ignore the reality that trans* people did not choose to experience gender incongruence and that there is no proven combination of counseling or spiritual practices to eliminate gender incongruence.

Then the other side yells, “Transition or suicide!” suggesting that transition is an effective intervention to reduce suicidality and that those who hesitate to bless hormonal and surgical transition are increasing suicidality.

However, available research is inconclusive about the effectiveness of hormonal and surgical transition to reduce suicide risk.

Some scientists, clinicians, and trans advocates argue that hormonal transition is safe + effective, even for minors. But other studies found meaningful health safety concerns related to hormonal transition, particularly if the individual does not display robust gender dysphoria.

Some studies demonstrated that side effects of hormonal transition could include increased risk of blood clots, risk of diabetes, increased risk of cancer, chronic low energy, increased risk of heart attack/stroke, & detrimental changes in blood pressure and cholesterol. Furthermore, prolonged use of cross-sex hormones is known to have irreversible effects such as a deeper voice in females & infertility in both biological sexes. Even greater risks are known for minors who undergo hormonal transition...[con't in comments]",0,"04/07/2023 08:36",https://www.instagram.com/p/CqvXziGOa_N/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,762,537,1,52,179,

Terminology, pronouns, & names can be an early barrier to friendship with trans* people.

In Equip's new Gender Incongruence Course, we use the term ""gender incongruence"" to mean ""an acute sense that one’s gender does not correspond with the experience typically associated with the person’s biological sex"".

Then we use the term ""transgender/trans*"" as ""a general term for someone who experiences gender incongruence"" without communicating anything about their theological convictions or the extent to which they have transitioned.

For those who experience gender incongruence, their biological pronouns can be a constant reminder of the pain + tension they feel every day. Some experience meaningful relief from that tension when they adopt different pronouns.

Using alternate pronouns (similar to identifying as gay, bi, lesbian, etc.) can mean as little as “I experience gender incongruence” or as much as “I am fundamentally a transgender person and must follow a trans* cultural script to be true to self” (& everything in between).

In conversation with a trans* person using alternate pronouns or a different name, I default to language mirroring as hospitality. I mirror their language out of respect, particularly if they're not a believer or I don't know them well.

To be clear, choosing to respect their preferences isn't an affirmation that they're using the best words + definitions, but is instead an act of hospitality to avoid tension over language & open the door for future conversation.

However, if a trans* Christian friend (with whom I have decades of friendship + mutually holding each other accountable) asks me to use alternate pronouns, I'll likely ask them what that means theologically for them & continue dialogue.

Finally, some claim there is biblical precedent for name change. Is there?

See the link in bio for my answer to that question (+more about the terms Equip uses, what pronouns mean, and why Christians should practice term mirroring)
