This Christmas Equip (the ministry I help run) has been serving homeless LGBT+ youth by distributing care packages in hopes that they would know God loves them deeply despite the challenges they are facing.

Plus, we're been working to help parents (and caretakers of all kinds) talk to their kids about God’s wisdom for sexuality and gender and hear those comforting words from Matthew 23:25: “Well done, good and faithful servant.”

Earlier this month we released Equip’s on-demand Parent Course, a 12-video resource complete with over 50 conversation scripts to help parents lead their kids ages 2-12 in age-appropriate conversation about God’s wisdom for sex, sexuality, and gender.

We need to raise $50,000 before the end of the year to get Equip's Parent Course into as many caretaker's hands as possible, and every donation up to $25K is doubled thanks to generous matching funds.

There's only a few weeks left in the year, and we're still $12,000 short of our goal. 

Would you help us equip parents with confidence and expertise to have these crucial conversations with their kids by pitching in $500 today or starting a recurring donation of $50/month?

Learn more and donate today at the link in bio.

Thank you for considering a gift to Equip this season. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

P.S. Check out pictures from Equip's recent 6th Annual Christmas Care Package Party where we wrote notes of encouragement and prayed over care packages for homeless LGBTQ+ teens.

God made each of us for intimacy. But romance idolatry inside and outside of the Church often tricks us into believing that our loneliness is exclusively a cry for romance/sex.

Yet when I meet with counseling clients who are lonely, I often ask, “If you had a spouse, what would that get you? How specifically would that person show up in your life and push back loneliness?”

You’d be surprised by their answers. If they mention romance/sex at all, it’s mixed in with a laundry list of other solutions:

“I just want someone that’s available to talk when I need somebody. I need to know someone will be home when I get home, everytime.”

“I need someone who knows how to celebrate me, and I need someone who it feels safe to let hold me when I’m hurting.”

What do you notice about those answers?

None of them require romance or sex.

God hasn’t forbidden anyone from reaching out for those solutions to loneliness. Those needs are good and universal. God wants each of us to have that kind of community.

Look to the spiritual friendships in Scripture for inspiration: David and Jonathan, Ruth and Naomi, Jesus and John, Paul and Timothy.

Instead of despairing that we’re destined to loneliness, recognize that there are many God-honoring ways to fulfill our true desires, and then take practical steps!

Identify people in your life who are interested in reciprocating healthy emotional, spiritual, physical, and intellectual intimacy.

Be intentional about spending time with those individuals, being vulnerable, and deepening friendship.

To this day, if I’m feeling lust kicked up, I try to resist shaming myself. Instead, I ask myself, “Are there ways I haven’t been meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways?”

The answer is almost always, “Yes.” So instead of beating myself up, I lean into my repentance by taking practical steps to lean more into healthy intimacy.",0,"12/20/2023 10:17",https://www.instagram.com/p/C1FagmER2Ez/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,3113,332,44,4,29,106

I just got all of the pictures from my lifetime commitments and video from the ceremony (watch the full video at the link in bio).

Scrolling through smiling faces and tender hugs from that day brought back memories.

I'll be honest. During most of the actual ceremony, I was mentally stuck in one of the worst anxiety merry-go-round's I've experienced in years.

Two days before my commitments, one of the NFOB guys experienced a mental health break. The other guys in the house didn't know what to do, but I'd helped this brother through something similar a few years ago, so I need to carry a lot of the burden.

During the 48 hours leading up to the ceremony I was constantly on and off the phone talking to his doctor, making sure he picked up his meds, coordinating with his biofam, convincing him to take his meds, etc.

On the day-of, the brother was left at our house and then later got lost in the church. By the time I got to the 15 minute countdown to start the service, I was broken.

The ceremony was a swirl of worry, embarrassment, and discomfort.

Eventually I made it to the reception, and was able to enjoy the rest of the evening. Then over the coming days and weeks, I learned how normal my experience was and how blessed myself and others were regardless of my emotional experience.

As I shared honestly with married friends about my distractedness, nearly a dozen couples independently reassured me, ""Well...to be honest...we had a hard time being present at our wedding. That seems pretty common. Don't worry!""

We planned the liturgy and sermon for my commitments to be particularly accessible to (and even compelling for) non-Christians, so I was deeply comforted when each of the people I'd invited who had the least context for singleness-for-Jesus each shared with me, ""Pieter, it all makes sense now..."" and shared how they finally saw the beauty of my choice to commit my life to God and a family of celibate brothers.

17996904974363496,17841415038692451,pieterlvalk,"Pieter L Valk, LPC","Should I call myself gay?

No matter what words I use to refer to my sexuality, I'll be misunderstood by someone. Every possible term/phrase carries baggage with one group or another.

And admittedly, over the past five years since I publicly came out and used the word ""gay"" to describe my sexuality, the ways the LGBT+ community guards the word “gay” seems to have changed.

Some LGBT+ advocates have shifted from insisting that experiencing same-sex attraction is all that is needed to be part of the LGBT+ community (or some other non-straight or non-cis experience) to instead insisting that genuine membership in the LGBT+ community requires agreement with political views unrelated to sexuality/gender.

At the same time, God has called me to reach the next generation with my public discipleship. Studies show that Gen Z and Gen Alpha increasingly identify as LGBT/queer and increasingly want nothing to do with Jesus.

Christians are failing to embody the gospel in a way that truly shows Jesus. Wherever we can lower barriers and make it easier for the next generation to see Jesus, we should. That includes the terms/words we use to talk about sexuality.

If we exclusively use ""same-sex attraction"" with Gen Z/alpha, at best they confusingly respond, ""Wait, what does that mean?"" At worst, they will have been warned by LGBT+ Tiktok that only Christians who want to send them to pray-the-gay-away camp use SSA.

For those reasons, I feel called to meet Gen Z/alpha where they're at and use the words they use, to reach them with God's wisdom for their sexualities, and more importantly, with God's gift of salvation.

Without further clarification, if I use ""gay"" to describe myself, I will be misunderstood. So, I accept the responsibility to clarify. Each time I call myself ""gay,"" I need to clarify that I'm committed to historic sexual ethics, that I'm merely using those words to refer to my same-sex attractions, and that I'm committed to vocational singleness.

So I'm going to keep calling myself ""gay"" for as long as that's the more effective word to use in the specific work I'm called to do.",0,"12/12/2023 08:30",https://www.instagram.com/p/C0wn674RoML/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,6366,554,71,12,42,139
18031656406729706,17841415038692451,pieterlvalk,"Pieter L Valk, LPC","Can SSA Christians experience healing?

Well, it depends on what you mean by ""healing.""

For many gay/SSA people who directly or indirectly interacted with the pray-the-gay-away movement of the late 1900s, pastors and therapists promised that God would completely eliminate their same-sex attractions and replace them with robust general opposite-sex attractions if gay/SSA people prayed hard enough or went to enough counseling.

That's what ""healing"" or ""change"" meant (and still means) to generations of gay/SSA people. That's what they were taught to hope, pray, and work for regarding their sexuality.

So, does that kind of healing happen?

Scientific analysis found that 96% of people who participated in ""sexual orientation change efforts"" experienced no meaningful reduction in their same-sex attractions or increase in their general opposite sex attractions.

However, those same efforts were found to increase participants’ likelihood of attempting suicide by 92%.

Does God have the power to perform miracles? Yes! Do I believe the testimonies of some who say their SSAs have been completely, miraculously replaced by general OSAs? Yes!

Christians can hope and pray for miracles. At the same time, it would be dangerously irresponsible for Christian leaders to build their strategy for LGBT+ ministry around an expectation that the average gay/SSA person will experience a miracle.

But there is another kind of healing that SSA Christians (and every other Christian) can expect.

In the Scriptures, God promises every Christian that if we lean into our sanctification, He will give us increasing strength to resist temptations of all kinds.

The frequency or magnitude of our temptations may not change (remember the thorn in Paul's side), but the Holy Spirit can empower us to be increasingly faithful to resist temptations.

In my life, counseling, prayer, and spiritual disciplines assigned by my pastors have helped with that. So have meeting my intimacy needs in healthy ways and adding practical restrictions/blocks to my devices.

If that's considered ""healing"" and ""change"" of my sexuality, then YES, change is not only possible, but promised!",0,"12/06/2023 12:31",https://www.instagram.com/p/C0hmwgjxyHp/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,3684,293,31,4,10,84

First, I try not to shame myself. In my experience, shaming myself for developing romantic feelings (and avoiding my crush out of shame) only leads to my attractions intensifying. The solution is healthy connection, not starvation and shame.

Second, I try not not to run away. God made each of us for healthy intimacy. Running away from my humanity doesn’t honor God–it just leaves me lonely and more vulnerable to temptation. Instead, lean into healthy friendship with the person you’re drawn to, with transparency and accountability.

Third, I try to be transparent. Sometimes, it’s better to discover there’s mutual interest sooner so you can recruit support/accountability from other friends instead of waiting to accidentally discover mutual interest in a time of moral vulnerability. 

Fourth, I cultivate multiple deep friendships. Don’t lean away from the person you’re crushing on, but simultaneously do invest in healthy intimacy with other friends. Develop depth in more than just one friendship.

And finally, I try to be patient with myself. Crushes are normal. They happen. They come and go. I can remind myself that every other wave of romantic feelings eventually passed, and so too will the current crush.

God, please give me (and others) the courage to resist shame, lean into healthy friendship, seek support, and be patient with myself.

As I understand it, God didn't intend for me to be romantically/sexually attracted to men. Yet over the past 20 years, the journey of bringing my sexuality before God and asking Him how He wanted to use my brokenness has been the greatest blessing of my life. Not because of my brokenness, but in spite of my brokenness.

Resisting my temptations has brought me face-to-face with how much the Church has made things worse (not better) for gay people, helping me empathize with queer people specifically and notice the pain of marginalized people more generally.

Resisting my temptations challenged me to connect with my feelings and discover the image of God within me. Resisting my temptations forced me to recognize that I was created for healthy connection with other humans and lean into intimacy with other men (instead of running away from it).

Resisting my temptations inspired me to help prevent the Church from failing the next generation of kids like me by starting Equip and training 28,000 Christians leaders (and counting) to better love queer people.

Resisting my temptations gave me the courage to admit that I needed lifelong, lived-in family and then start the Nashville Family of Brothers where myself and others could find the community we needed.

My life is like a Kintsugi Japanese golden repair work. Kintsugi artists reconnect broken pottery pieces using gold, producing something even more beautiful than the original. It wasn’t “good” that the original work was broken. But despite that brokenness, something even more beautiful can be created.

God has been a gentle and persistent Kintsugi artist, taking my broken sexuality and working with me to turn them into something even more beautiful. For that, I could not be more grateful.",0,"11/28/2023 14:08",https://www.instagram.com/p/C0NLeJaR2i-/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,5947,819,87,15,55,161

There’s a big difference between “call me in an emergency” family and everyday family. Let’s face it, any day without committed lived-in family is an emergency.

While “emergency” family have good intentions, they’re only offering reactive and temporary support that ceases after the emergency.

Before making lifetime commitments to my brotherhood, it often felt like I could only get help if I was in a crisis. I lived an existence of prolonged loneliness, punctuated by short-term family in moments of emergency.

Single moms in my life share that they’ve got plenty of emergency family who swoop in for a night to care in crisis. But then these knights in shining armor go back to their “normal” lives. And the single mom goes back to the everyday emergency of raising kids alone and living without adult human companionship.

No one is willing to provide real family by stepping into the slow, never-ending emergency. No one is willing to move in with her or have her move in with them. No one is willing to have a true open door policy and promises never to move away.

Single people, regardless of children, get caught in a cycle of never ending self-advocacy with unpredictable results. Sometimes we’re told we can “call anytime” only to realize that this statement meant, “call anytime, and I’ll respond when it’s convenient for my family.” Sometimes it seems easier to learn to never be in need.

We all need people we can call in emergencies; and I’m grateful for those in my life (and the lives of single moms I know).

We also need true family that includes us in the everyday rhythm of their lives. But as every married person knows, real family requires sacrifice.

I had the privilege of offering one of the eulogies at my grandmother's funeral. I shared many of the fond memories from my earlier tribute.

But over the past few days, I've found myself wondering where, exactly, Gaga is now. What's she thinking? Feeling? Who is she with?

I know these same questions have burdened others journeying through grief.

So I closed the eulogy with comforting answers to those questions found in the Scriptures:

""...Christians have historically understood various passages to teach that those who have been baptized and confessed that Jesus is their Lord will ultimately spend eternity in a physical New Heavens and Earth in new physical, perfect resurrected bodies.
 
But that physical new dwelling place won't be established until Jesus returns. So what about in the meantime?
 
Well, in Luke 23 the criminal hanging on the cross next to Jesus confesses to Jesus, and Jesus reassures him that, on that same day, the criminal would be with Jesus in paradise. In a place of bliss and without pain.
 
In John 14 Jesus says he will go to prepare a place for us, and the Greek word for this place means a temporary place to stay and rest before continuing on the journey.
 
In this paradise place with Jesus, we're not in our old bodies anymore, but we also don't have our new perfect resurrected bodies yet either.
As Christians have historically understood, ""to be away from the body is to be present with the Lord.""
 
And we are conscious of Christ's comforting presence, aware of what's still going on among the living, and eagerly waiting for Jesus to return.
 
In Revelation 6 and Romans 8 it says all those who are waiting with Jesus yearn for Jesus to return to earth and finish the job of making the world right, establish that new physical dwelling place, and give those waiting their new physical resurrected bodies.
 
To put it more simply: Gaga is with Jesus, in a place where there is no pain, and where she is eagerly watching and waiting.
 
That's a comfort to me. Maybe that's a comfort to you.

She was widowed when my mom was 3 years old, and my mom is her only child. She was proud that she never took a handout and never failed to put a warm meal on the table for my mom. But she needed us.

Work kept both my parents busy, and every Friday night until we were in college, my little brother and I slept over at Gaga's house. We needed her.

When I was a kid, she'd spend hours racing matchbox cars across the carpet with me, tearing holes in her pants and skinning her knees in the process. 

Gaga joined my mom and me for many out-of-town soccer tournaments, and I chuckle remembering the Saturday night when the three of us went to Hooter's together. ""The wings are good!"" Gaga exclaimed.

I remember joining my mom to take Gaga on her dream 60th birthday trip: New York City. The strangest and sweetest moment was when Gaga sobbed while sitting in the audience of Regis & Kelly, her favorite TV show.

I never got to tell her that we had a particular thing in common: both of us are a hard pass on any guy who is balding. Even when she was 70 years old, she had high standards, haha.

Gaga got in trouble with her HOA multiple times for feeding stray cats from her back door. She was stubborn. And she was the kind of person who *had* to do something when she saw anyone (or a cat) in need.

She was also deeply lonely and afraid, particularly over the last decade, exacerbated by the pandemic. Her pain often came out as anger. These past few years, she wasn't who she wanted to be. 

In the midst of that yuckiness, my mom was Gaga's primary caretaker. No matter what fear-driven frustration Gaga dished out, my mom continued to patiently love. Over and over again, she responded with an unreasonably forgiving love that looks a lot like Jesus.

May we all love like my mom, particularly when it's hard. That's when it counts most.

My grandmother was trapped and tortured by the brokenness of this world. But no longer.
